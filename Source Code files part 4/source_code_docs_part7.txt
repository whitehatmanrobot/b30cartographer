1307
Available Threads is the number of server threads on this CPU not currently working on requests from a client.  The server dynamically adjusts the number of threads to maximize server performance.
1309
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing.  This is the instantaneous number of available work items for this CPU.  A sustained near-zero value indicates the need to increase the MinFreeWorkItems registry value for the Server service.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.

Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. When a CPU runs out of work items, it borrows a free work item from another CPU.  An increasing value of this running counter might indicate the need to increase the 'MaxWorkItems' or 'MinFreeWorkItems' registry values for the Server service.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.
1313
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing.

1331
Total Bytes/sec is the rate the Server is reading and writing data to and from the files for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.
1333
Total Operations/sec is the rate the Server is performing file read and file write operations for the clients on this CPU.  This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.
1335
DPCs Queued/sec is the overall rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the processor's DPC queue. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. Each processor has its own DPC queue.) This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
1337
DPC Rate is the rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the processor's DPC queue between the timer tics of the processor clock. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. Each processor has its own DPC queue.)

1343
Total DPCs Queued/sec is the combined rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the DPC queue of all processors on the computer. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts.) Each processor has its own DPC queue. This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. It is the sum of Processor: DPCs Queued/sec for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. This counter displays the d
ifference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
1345
Total DPC Rate is the combined rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the DPC queues of all processors between timer tics of each processor's system clock. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts.) Each processor has its own DPC queue. clock on the processor. This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. It is the sum of Processor: DPC Rate for all processors on the computer, divided by the nu
mber of processors. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Devctl   Device path exerciser Title _PID_GUIDDevctl   Device path exerciser Neill clift Normal Neill Clift Microsoft Word 8.0{j'&{j'&Devctl   Device path exerciser This program is designed to crash drivers by calling them through various user mode I/O interfaces. It does not test the functionality but rather the dis-functionality of drivers. Drivers should be resilient to bad data from user mode in exactly the same way that kernel entry points have to be. If they are not resilient then they open up denial of service attacks and in some cases a mechanism to bypass system security. This program attempts to locate drivers that don t handle these calls gracefully: Unexpected entry points into the driver. For example file system query functions to a sound card. Query functions with buffers that are too small to contain all the data to be returned. IOCTL/FSCTL functions with missing buffers or buffers that are two small or contain garbage. IOCTL/FSCTL with direct I/O or type3 buffers with data changing asynchronously. IOCTL/FSCTL with bad pointers for type3 requests. IOCTL/FSCTL and fast path query functions where the users buffer mapping may change asynchronously. Pages become unreadable at arbitrary execution points. Relative opens with strange file names, Opens to strange device objects like the direct device open or file system devices. Issues requests both synchronously and asynchronously to the device. Graceful behavior does not include any of the following: The system crashes. System memory pools are corrupted. Memory is leaked. IRPs are not completed correctly. While the program runs it writes lines to the file crashn.log. After each line is written the file is flushed so that in the event of a crash the offending operation is easy to determine should the system be difficult to debug. The flush operation makes this operation expensive so in some places only one portion of a block of operations is logged. For example, only logs for IOCTL for a particular function value are logged rather than each IOCTL. When the program is restarted it takes the last line from crashn.log and places it in the file crash.log. This is assumed to be a failed operation. Operations within crash.log are not performed again by default. After each operation is performed a check on consumed memory within the system is done. The pool tag database and lookaside information is queried. If this operation caused either one of these memory sources to be depleted the operation is repeated. Obviously this increase in memory consumption may have had nothing to do with the request that was just performed. Typically the second call won t see an increase and the program continues. Real memory leaks show up as a vast number of repeated calls and the tag in question raised to the top of the poolmon display sorted by difference (d). For calls that would typically be buffered I/O operations the program tracks the number of exceptions the operating system has dispatched. If the number of exceptions increases the operation is also repeated. Although buffered I/O operations may also reference the users address space, its rare and exception dispatching may signal an internal error that s being handled by an exception handler masking a true parameter or handle validation problem. Devctl can run with the bottom hardware page mapped so that NULL pointer de-references don t raise exceptions but return garbage. This gives another possible path to show up bad validation. Candidates for pool leaks and exceptions are logged to a file (diags.txt) should the leak not crash the system or the many repeated calls are missed by the user. The programs basic execution passes are: Issue various opens. Synchronous, Asynchronous, Direct, Relative (with various filenames). These catch drivers that are unaware of the relative open semantics and the fact they have to do their own security checks and drivers that may have word integer overflow problems manipulating file names. Issue queries for just about all possible items the driver might understand. Issue miscellaneous functions with the file handle like flush, create section, read and write (for asynchronous handles only). Reads and writes for obscure file offsets are performed. These include append writes where the file offset is a 2^64-1 and reads and writes where the offset is an unsigned 63 bit quantity that wraps to a signed 64 bit value when the length is added on. These catch read and write paths that don t know the full semantics of file offsets or have overflow problems in their validation. Issue miscellaneous handle less functions such as NtDeletefile, NtQueryFullAttributesFile etc. These exercise some of the fast open paths used for network queries etc. Issue an IOCTL and FSCTL pass with zero length input and output buffers. This pass detects the most common driver error of not checking buffer length properly. Issue random IOCTL and FSCTL calls with random size buffers. For buffered I/O requests the buffers are valid but contain random data. For Direct I/O requests the buffers are valid, contain random data that changes asynchronously with this threads execution and are butted to the ends of H/W pages to make more likely references beyond buffer end will fail. For type 3 buffers the pointers are random. After IOCTL passes and as part of a  miscellaneous function calls pass  devctl issues a cancel request to the driver. IRPs that were lost (never completed by calling IoCompleteRequest or passed to other drivers but finished with by the device) will cause the process to hang. Through some paths popups appear from the I/O manager warning that IRPs didn t cancel within an allotted time. These lost IRPs are easily debugged by issuing  !process 0 0  from the debugger. Select the devctl process via a  !process xxx  where xxx is the CID (Client ID) . The IRP (possibly more that one) will show up queued to one of the devctls threads. Use  !IRP xxxx  where xxx is the IRP address to work out what IRP was lost. Occasionally IOCTL or FSCTL requests will pass parameter validation by a driver and will pend for a synchronous request (say some kind of notify request to a driver). Hitting ^C will cause the program to terminate in this case but not for a lost IRP case. The basic syntax for the program is: devctl [/i] [/l] [/il nn] [/iu mm] [devnam] / and + enable options, - disables options /a      Do all devices in system. Don't prompt for yes/now etc /al     Alert the main thread periodically /c      Enable or disable skipping operations that aborted or crashed /dl nn  Sets lower limit for device type portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /du nn  Sets upper limit for device type portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /e      Enable or disable zero length EA's, needed on checked builds /f      Enable or disable all FSCTL paths /fn     Enable or disable FSCTL paths with null buffers /fr     Enable or disable FSCTL paths with random buffers /fl nn  Sets lower limit for function portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /fu nn  Sets upper limit for function portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /h /?   Prints this message /g c h  Grabs a handle from another process /i      Enable or disable all IOCTL paths /if     Enable or disable all FSCTL and IOCTL paths /in     Enable or disable IOCTL paths with null buffers /ir     Enable or disable IOCTL paths with random buffers /l      Enable or disable logging and skipping failing functions /m      Enable or disable the misc functions /n      Map zero page so that NULL pointer de-references don't raise /p      Enable or disable the checks on pool usage via tags and lookaside lists /q      Enable or disable the normal handle query functions /r      Enable or disable skipping operations already logged as done /s      Enable or disable the sub or relative opens to obtain handles /t nn   Set maximum number of IOCTL/FSCTL calls made with random buffers /v      Enable or disable the printing of error status values for calls Devnam is the device to open to issue requests. It must be in native object tree format like  \device\null . If this is omitted the program prompts for each device in turn.

You can get must quicker coverage if you know the range of IOCTL s the driver accepts. Here is the procedure with IPNAT: // NAT-supported IOCTL constant declarations #define IOCTL_IP_NAT_SET_GLOBAL_INFO \     _IP_NAT_CTL_CODE(0, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_WRITE_ACCESS) #define IOCTL_IP_NAT_CREATE_INTERFACE \     _IP_NAT_CTL_CODE(2, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_WRITE_ACCESS) #define IOCTL_IP_NAT_DELETE_REDIRECT \     _IP_NAT_CTL_CODE(13, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_WRITE_ACCESS) The first number in this macro is the function number. You can limit devctl to just cover this range with a command like devctl +fl 0 +fu 13. This limits both the IOCTL and FSCTL zero length and random buffer calls. This will run quite quickly so its probably worth increasing the number of random buffers the program throws at the driver with say +t nnnn. |yvsme]U

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Devctl   Device path exerciser Title _PID_GUIDDevctl   Device path exerciser Neill clift Normal Chuck Microsoft Word 8.0Devctl   Device path exerciser This program is designed to crash drivers by calling them through various user mode I/O interfaces. It does not test the functionality but rather the dis-functionality of drivers. Drivers should be resilient to bad data from user mode in exactly the same way that kernel entry points have to be. If they are not resilient then they open up denial of service attacks and in some cases a mechanism to bypass system security. This program attempts to locate drivers that don t handle these calls gracefully: Unexpected entry points into the driver. For example file system query functions to a sound card. Query functions with buffers that are too small to contain all the data to be returned. IOCTL/FSCTL functions with missing buffers or buffers that are two small or contain garbage. IOCTL/FSCTL with direct I/O or type3 buffers with data changing asynchronously. IOCTL/FSCTL with bad pointers for type3 requests. IOCTL/FSCTL and fast path query functions where the users buffer mapping may change asynchronously. Pages become unreadable at arbitrary execution points. Relative opens with strange file names, Opens to strange device objects like the direct device open or file system devices. Issues requests both synchronously and asynchronously to the device. Graceful behavior does not include any of the following: The system crashes. System memory pools are corrupted. Memory is leaked. IRPs are not completed correctly. While the program runs it writes lines to the file crashn.log. After each line is written the file is flushed so that in the event of a crash the offending operation is easy to determine should the system be difficult to debug. The flush operation makes this operation expensive so in some places only one portion of a block of operations is logged. For example, only logs for IOCTL for a particular function value are logged rather than each IOCTL. When the program is restarted it takes the last line from crashn.log and places it in the file crash.log. This is assumed to be a failed operation. Operations within crash.log are not performed again by default. After each operation is performed a check on consumed memory within the system is done. The pool tag database and lookaside information is queried. If this operation caused either one of these memory sources to be depleted the operation is repeated. Obviously this increase in memory consumption may have had nothing to do with the request that was just performed. Typically the second call won t see an increase and the program continues. Real memory leaks show up as a vast number of repeated calls and the tag in question raised to the top of the poolmon display sorted by difference (d). For calls that would typically be buffered I/O operations the program tracks the number of exceptions the operating system has dispatched. If the number of exceptions increases the operation is also repeated. Although buffered I/O operations may also reference the users address space, its rare and exception dispatching may signal an internal error that s being handled by an exception handler masking a true parameter or handle validation problem. Devctl can run with the bottom hardware page mapped so that NULL pointer de-references don t raise exceptions but return garbage. This gives another possible path to show up bad validation. Candidates for pool leaks and exceptions are logged to a file (diags.txt) should the leak not crash the system or the many repeated calls are missed by the user. The programs basic execution passes are: Issue various opens. Synchronous, Asynchronous, Direct, Relative (with various filenames). These catch drivers that are unaware of the relative open semantics and the fact they have to do their own security checks and drivers that may have word integer overflow problems manipulating file names. Issue queries for just about all possible items the driver might understand. Issue miscellaneous functions with the file handle like flush, create section, read and write (for asynchronous handles only). Reads and writes for obscure file offsets are performed. These include append writes where the file offset is a 2^64-1 and reads and writes where the offset is an unsigned 63 bit quantity that wraps to a signed 64 bit value when the length is added on. These catch read and write paths that don t know the full semantics of file offsets or have overflow problems in their validation. Issue miscellaneous handle less functions such as NtDeletefile, NtQueryFullAttributesFile etc. These exercise some of the fast open paths used for network queries etc. Issue an IOCTL and FSCTL pass with zero length input and output buffers. This pass detects the most common driver error of not checking buffer length properly. Issue random IOCTL and FSCTL calls with random size buffers. For buffered I/O requests the buffers are valid but contain random data. For Direct I/O requests the buffers are valid, contain random data that changes asynchronously with this threads execution and are butted to the ends of H/W pages to make more likely references beyond buffer end will fail. For type 3 buffers the pointers are random. After IOCTL passes and as part of a  miscellaneous function calls pass  devctl issues a cancel request to the driver. IRPs that were lost (never completed by calling IoCompleteRequest or passed to other drivers but finished with by the device) will cause the process to hang. Through some paths popups appear from the I/O manager warning that IRPs didn t cancel within an allotted time. These lost IRPs are easily debugged by issuing  !process 0 0  from the debugger. Select the devctl process via a  !process xxx  where xxx is the CID (Client ID) . The IRP (possibly more that one) will show up queued to one of the devctls threads. Use  !IRP xxxx  where xxx is the IRP address to work out what IRP was lost. Occasionally IOCTL or FSCTL requests will pass parameter validation by a driver and will pend for a synchronous request (say some kind of notify request to a driver). Hitting ^C will cause the program to terminate in this case but not for a lost IRP case. The basic syntax for the program is: devctl [/i] [/l] [/il nn] [/iu mm] [devnam] / and + enable options, - disables options /a      Do all devices in system. Don't prompt for yes/now etc /al     Alert the main thread periodically /c      Enable or disable skipping operations that aborted or crashed /dl nn  Sets lower limit for device type portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /du nn  Sets upper limit for device type portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /e      Enable or disable zero length EA's, needed on checked builds /f      Enable or disable all FSCTL paths /fn     Enable or disable FSCTL paths with null buffers /fr     Enable or disable FSCTL paths with random buffers /fl nn  Sets lower limit for function portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /fu nn  Sets upper limit for function portion of IOCTL and FSCTL code /h /?

It must be in native object tree format like  \device\null . If this is omitted the program prompts for each device in turn. You can skip to a particular device by typing  \prefix  where prefix is the first few characters of the device you want to match.

		Installing and Using Pentium Counters
				(P5CTRS)
		for Windows NT Performance Monitor

The Pentium counters are extensible counters for Windows NT Performance 
Monitor that let you monitor the inner workings of Pentium (P5) and 
Pentium Pro (P6) processors. You can use the Pperf application to 
monitor the Pentium counters, or install the counters in Performance 
Monitor so that you can include counter data in Performance Monitor 
charts, logs, reports, and alerts.

This help file includes instructions for installing the Pentium Counters 
in Performance Monitor, and for using Pperf to activate the Pentium 
Counters so that they display valid data in Performance Monitor.

Required files:		Pperf.exe
			Pdump.exe
			Pstat.sys
			P5Ctrnam.h
			P5ctrs.dll
			P5ctrs.ini
			P5perf.reg

Note:  Some Pentium counters are designed only for P5 processors; others 
are only for P6 processors. The installation utility recognizes the 
processor on the computer and installs only the counters for that 
processor.

There are three tasks required to install the Pentium counters:

 -- Install the Pstat.sys driver for the PPERF application.
 -- Copy files from this CD to Windows NT system directories.
 -- Install the Pentium counter names into Performance Monitor.


Step 1: Install the Pstat.sys driver.

1.  Logon as the administrator of the computer.

2.  From the Command Prompt, change to the subdirectory where the P5CTRS 
files are installed. The default is \PerfTool\P5CTRS.

3.  Type: regedit p5perf.reg


Step 2: Copy PPerf files to system directories

1.  Copy the driver files, Pstat.sys, to the 
%Systemroot%\system32\drivers subdirectory.  
	
2.  Copy P5ctrs.dll to the %Systemroot%\system32 subdirectory.
       

Step 3: Install the Pentium counter names and explain text in 
Performance Monitor.

1.  From the Command Prompt, change to the subdirectory where the P5CTRS 
files are installed.  The default is \Perftool\P5CTRS.

2.  Type: lodctr p5ctrs.ini

3.  Shutdown, then restart the computer.


TIP:  To verify that the Pentium counters were installed correctly, 
start Control Panel and double-click the Devices icon. In the Devices 
dialog box, scroll down to the entry for PStat, the Pentium counters 
driver.  Its status should be "Started." 


		     Activating the Pentium Counters

The Pentium counters must be activated by selecting them in Pperf before 
they can display valid values in Performance Monitor. Some Pentium 
counters require that one Pperf counter be activated; others require two 
Pperf counters. To determine which Pperf counters to select to activate 
the Performance Monitor Pentium counters, see either of the following 
sources:

	In Performance Monitor, select Add to Chart from the Edit menu (or 
click the + button on the toolbar), select Pentium from the Object list, 
and select the counter from the Counters list. Click the Explain button. 
The required Pperf counters are listed in the explantory text displayed 
at the bottom of the dialog box.

	- or -

	Use Counters.hlp, a help file listing the names and descriptions 
of the standard Performance Monitor counters. Counters.hlp is included 
on the Windows NT Resource Kit CD in the Performance 	Tools group 
(\Ntreskit\PerfTool\CntrTools). Double-click Counters.hlp, double-click 
Performance Counters by Object, and then double-click Pentium Object. 
The Pperf counter(s) that activate each Pentium counter are included in 
the description of the counter.

Pperf lets you select two Pperf counters at a time and set monitoring 
options for the counters. Some Pentium counters require two Pperf 
counters to activate them. However, if you are activating a Pentium 
counter that requires just one Pperf counter, you can set the second 
Pperf counter field so as to activate a different Pentium counter or set 
it to the same counter. Do not set different monitoring options for the 
same counter.

To select counters in Pperf:

1.  Start Pperf.exe.

2.  Click Select on the menu bar.

3.  From the Internal P5 Counter # 1 drop-down list, select a counter.

4.  Click the check boxes beside the counter to set the options for the           
counter. (It is recommended that you check both R0 and R3).	 
    
    R0 - (Ring 0) - Click this box to enable the counter to monitor 
kernel-mode (also known as privileged-mode) actity. The core operating 
system components run in this processing mode.

    R1 - (Ring 3) - Click this box to enable the counter to monitor 
user-mode activity. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral 
subsystems run in this processing mode.

    K  - (Kilo) - Click this box to direct Pperf to display the counter 
data in units of  1K (1024). This setting does not affect Performance 
Monitor.

5.  From the Internal P5 Counter # 2 drop-list, select a counter.

6.  Click the check boxes beside the counter to set the options for the 
counter. (It is recommended that you check both R0 and R3.) The options 
are described under step 4 (above).

7.   Click Ok.
    

You can monitor the counters from PPerf or use Performance Monitor to 
chart, log, report on or set alerts on a counter.  

To use Performance Monitor to monitor the Pentium counters, 

1.  Start Performance Monitor (it's in the Administrative Tools (Common) 
program group). 

2. Click the + button, or select Add to Chart from the Edit menu.

3.  From the Object drop-down list, select Pentium.

4.  From the Counter drop-down list, select the counters activated by 
the Pperf counter you selected, and click the Add button.

If you choose a counter in Performance Monitor that you didn't first 
select by using PPerf, the value of the counters will always be 0.

This applies to raw PDOs and legacy devices for which the PnP mechanism of specifying a security descriptor through an INF cannot be applied. This closes the security hole of not being able to set a default security descriptor on a newly created device object, thus opening a small window in which a malicious application can access the unprotected device object. The API will be added to XP SP1 and .NET server as well. For Windows XP this function is defined as a wrapper in a separate library, so no code changes to XP SP1 will be needed. For .NET Server, this will probably be made as part of the kernel. A reason for this is that the library wrapper attempts to load a kernel version of the API, so a driver written with the wrapper library for SP1 can actually use a newer and better version implemented in the operating system when running in .NET Server. The prototype of the function is like this: NTSTATUS IoCreateDeviceSecure(     IN  PDRIVER_OBJECT      DriverObject,     IN  ULONG               DeviceExtensionSize,     IN  PUNICODE_STRING     DeviceName        OPTIONAL,     IN  DEVICE_TYPE         DeviceType,     IN  ULONG               DeviceCharacteristics,     IN  BOOLEAN             Exclusive,     IN  PCUNICODE_STRING    DefaultSDDLString,     IN  LPCGUID             DeviceClassGuid,     OUT PDEVICE_OBJECT     *DeviceObject     ) The first 6 parameters are identical to the first 6 parameters of IoCreateDevice, are described in the DDK and will not be discussed here except in the context of the overriding class GUID. A note about DeviceName: this API will work only for named objects (only in this context does the security descriptor make sense). DefaultSDDLString is a SDDL string that describes the security descriptor to be applied. The following is taken from the function comments (so it may change): Only the subset of the SDDL format is currently supported. The format   D:P(ACE)(ACE)(ACE), where (ACE) is (AceType;;Access;;;SID) Where:   AceType - Only Allow ("A") is supported.   Access - Rights specified in either hex format (0xnnnnnnnn), or via the            SDDL Generic/Standard abbreviations   SID - Only a subset of the SDDL abbreviations are supported         SY (System),         BA (Admin),         WD (World),         IU (Interactive Users),         LS (Local Service),         RC, AN, BG, BU, NU, and NS         The S-w-x-y-z form for SIDs is not supported   The unmentioned ace fields (AceFlags, ObjectGuid, InheritObjectGuid)   are not supported. Example -   "D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)" which is Allow System to have Generic All access. DeviceClassGuid is the GUID of a class whose settings can be used to override the settings specified in the API s parameters. The parameters can be overridden are: DeviceType, DeviceCharacteristics, Exclusive and Security Decsriptor. The idea is that an administrator can modify these settings class-wide and the modified settings can be applied to the new device object. One important detail is that the security descriptor set by IoCreateDeviceSecure has the SE_DACL_DEFAULTED bit set, but when loading security settings from the registry, the settings will be ignored if this bit is set. This way, a more recent version on the driver can apply better default security settings without giving to change the registry. On the other hand, security settings set through other mechanisms (like SetupDiSetClassRegistryProperty) will have this bit cleared and will override driver-supplied settings. DeviceObject   the same as the last parameter of IoCreateDevice, receives a pointer to the device object that is created. Test cases The test will use a driver that calls this API with various parameters as described below. Some test cases will involve manual operations. Automating them is not a priority for now. Also, for the first version we will use the bulk of the logic in the kernel-mode driver (e.g. we will check that the function s return value and expected result are correct in user mode rather than in user mode). This may change in the future.  The central problem is how to check that an SDDL string applied through this mechanism is indeed applied. This task is complicated by the fact that we cannot just retrieve the security descriptor from kernel-mode and apply a reverse conversion (SD to SDDL string) because the access-rights mapping differs (I/O Manager maps differently certain access rights). In order to check this we build a security descriptor from the SDDL string using the user-mode APIs (ConvertStringSecurityDescriptorToSecurityDescriptor). Then we create a device object using the regular IoCreateDeviceObject, open a handle to it and apply the security descriptor using NtSetSecurity API. Finally we compare at the binary level the 2 security descriptors: the one got from the device object after IoCreateDeviceSecure and the one got from the device object after IoCreateDevice and NtSetSecurityDescriptor). Incorrect Device Name NULL DeviceName and no Autogenerated flag. Expected failure NULL DeviceName but Autogenerated flag set, success is expected. NULL DeviceClassGuid, there is no override All parameters valid, NULL DeviceClassGuid. We will check that a device object is created, then we will retrieve his security descriptor through ObGetSecurityDescriptor and check it matches the SDDL string passed in. Repeat 2.3 with a different SDDL string, expect settings are not overridden (a NULL DeviceClassGuid does not entail creating a Class that will override subsequent calls, etc.) Non-NULL DeviceClassGuid, security override works The same as 2.3, but use a non-NULL DeviceClassGuid. Expect success and security descriptor matches the SDDL string. Repeat 2.5 with a different SDDL string and check that the security settings are not overridden by the class security settings set before. This is because we did not clear the SE_DACL_DEFAULTED bit in the security descriptor by using a external mechanism (like SetupDiSetClassRegistryProperty). Use SetupDiSetClassRegistryProperty to set a different security descriptor and check that in this case, the driver settings are overridden by the class settings. Repeat 2.5 across a reboot to check that class settings are persistent. Edit the class security settings in the registry and check that the new settings will be applied in a new override instead of the old ones. Check that Deny ACLs can be applied through the registry override mechanism (since there is no SDDL string to be parsed in this case). Non-NULL DeviceClassGuid, non-security overrides work (DeviceType, Characteristics and Exclusivity). The driver will be instructed to call IoCreateDeviceSecure with these 3 parameters different from what is in the class registry key. This way, we can check that the class settings ovevride what the device passes in. Check that DeviceType can be overridden by accessing the device object somehow. Check that Device Characteristics can be overridden. One interesting question is what happens if somehow the class override specifies FILE_AUTOGENERATED_DEVICE_NAME.  Check that Exclusive flag can be overriden . Various SDDL strings Pass in an invalid SDDL string and  a NULL DeviceClassGUID (for simplicity) and check that an error is returned. Pass in a valid SDDL string but with settings that do not apply to device objects (e.g. inherit access rights, etc.)   We need to try different strings that would make sense for a driver writer to use.  A list of strings used is presented here (TRUE near the string means we expect to succeed in creating a secure device object, FALSE means we exepect to fail):    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGX;;;BA)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GRGW;;;WD)(A;;GR;;;RC)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;WD)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;WD)(A;;GR;;;RC)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GRGWGX;;;WD)(A;;GRGWGX;;;RC)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;0x0004;;;WD)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;WD)(A;;GA;;;RC)", TRUE},    //    // Various groups    //    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;AO)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;AU)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;BA)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;BG)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;BO)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;BU)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;CA)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;DA)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;DG)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;DU)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;IU)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;LA)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;LG)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;NU)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;PO)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;PU)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;RC)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;SO)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;SU)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;WD)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;NS)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;LS)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;AN)", TRUE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;RN)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;RD)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GR;;;NO)", FALSE},    //    // Weird, but valid    //    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;BA)", TRUE},    //    // Some bad strings - deny access    //    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(D;;GW;;;IU)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;BA)(D;;GW;;;IU)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(D;;GX;;;SU)", FALSE},    //    // SACL    //    {L"S:P(A;;GA;;;SY)", FALSE},    //    // Object and container inheritance    //    {L"D:P(A;OICI;GA;;;SY)", FALSE},    //    // Weird    //    {L"D:WEIRD", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;GA;;XX)", FALSE},    {L"D:P(A;;QA;;BA)", FALSE}    // Use the SDDL strings in a file (sddls.txt). All the strings in this file are expected to fail (they contain syntax elements that are not supported by our parser). Miscelaneous Check that registry settings can be modified only by administrators and have no relationship to the security descriptor being set. In other words the class key that is created can be modified by administrators only, irrespective of what the SDDL string is. Check that the mechanism to use a kernel import is present works. This will be difficult to test, but we will provide a private kernel with implements IoCreateDeviceSecure and check that the kernel function is used instead of the library one. Check that all the default strings can be successfully used. We are not going to check that they exactly represent what they want, we will leave it to a detailed analysis from the security team. We will only check that all the defined strings in wdmsec.h are syntactically correct and can be applied to create device objects. 3. Usage The files needed by this test are: wdmsectest.sys, the kernel-mode driver wdmsectest.exe the user-mode application wdmsect.inf   the INF file needed to install the kernel-mode driver ntlog.dll   library used to logging results. Can be obtained from:  HYPERLINK "\\\\ntdev\\release\\main\\usa\\2600\\{x86fre|ia64fre}\\test\\commontest"  \\ntdev\release\main\usa\2600\{x86fre|ia64fre}\test\commontest sddls.txt   contains the list of interesting SDDL strings To run the test, make sure ntlog.dll is in the LoadLibrary path, copy wdmsect.inf to %windir%\inf and wdmsectest.sys to %windir%\system32\drivers, then start: wdmsectest.exe The first time, we will perform a PnP installation of the driver. The test application opens a handle to the test device and instructs it to execute test cases. The results are logged in a file called wdmsectest.log in the current directory (see below for an example of a log file). Note that the test may break into the debugger if two inconsistent security descriptors are found to facilitate examining the differences between the two. We will run tests on the following platforms with driver verifier enabled on wdmsectest.sys: x86 .NET Server  (ADS) IA64 .NET Server (ADS) x86 XPSP1 (Pro) IA64 XPSP1 (Pro) x86 Windows 2000. This may require some changes to the test code since some APIs may not work on Windows 2000.

Use checked-in msi (and build script) under clickonce\msi instead.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\win32\clickonce\installshield\readme.txt ===
'src' location set in the ism is \\fusion\drop\clickonce\latestbuild

meaning binaries should be put there for the ism/msi build process to pick up.

Package code is set to re-GUID automatically every time ism builds (so no need to change manually).

Upgrade table is filled in such a way that forces an upgrade for any product version msi accepts (so no need to change manually).

 
Steps for a new clickonce drop version:

 
In installshield:

product code (re-GUID) 
product version 

all/any other reg key/values that contains a version number (note formats: 1.0.615.0 vs. 1.0.615 etc) 

after build:

do    msistuff setup.exe /p UILevel=INSTALLUILEVEL_BASIC

steps to build a new msi package:

1. change build version in includes\version.h and ndphost\ndphost.cs (optional...)
2. build clickonce, build ndphost to get ndphost\ndphost.exe
3. in a razzle window (x86), from under msi\, run clickonceMsiBuild.cmd
4. new msi package is ready under bld# directory!

-

msi build script  - a cmd file that runs in a razzle window (environment settings needed), under clickonce\msi which performs all the steps (delta) needed and:

automatically pick out the version/build number from the header file
automatically pick up binaries
build upon a base (clickonce\msi\base) - baseline set of files (eg. an older Clickonce Redist.msi)
can be debugged if misconfigured
no compiled code! 1 cmd file and 3 vbs from MSI SDK, utilizes MSI APIs
no ism file to change and check-in for a new version drop
work best with small set of (mechanical) deltas (eg. version changes; file size, time stamp updates) between drops

-

TO ADD A NEW WRAPPER
====================
  Usually, just list it in apilist.txt.
  The file is presently sorted, but that does not matter.

  If the function is BOOL/LastError, failure is false, you're done.
  If the function returns an HRESULT or an NTSTATUS, you're done.
  If the function returns a Win32 error, like a registry function, add it to
    the registry section in winthrow_err.tpl
  If the function returns a PVOID, failure is false, you're done.
  The most common case that requires additional work is if the function
    returns a HANDLE or an integral type, like int, long, ULONG, DWORD, etc.
    For these, if the error value is 0, -1, or 0xFFFFFFFF, just add it to
    the "appropriate" section.

UNDONE: Sized buffers. We need another set of wrappers for these.

This directory produces "throwing wrappers" over Win32 functions.
The throwing wrappers come in three flavors:

"same signature-or-throw"

HANDLE CreateFileOrThrow(...)
{
    HANDLE h = CreateFileW(...);
    if (h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
        Throw...;
    return h;
}

"same signature-or-throw-unless-count-dots"

HANDLE CreateFileOrThrow(..., DWORD& LastErrorOut, SIZE_T CountOfOkErrors, DWORD OkErrors...)
{
    LastErrorOut = NO_ERROR;
    HANDLE h = CreateFileW(...);
    if (h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    {
        LastErrorOut = GetLastError();
        if (LastErrorOut not in OkErrors)
            Throw...;
    }
    return h;
}

"same signagure-or-throw-unless-count-valist"

HANDLE CreateFileOrThrow(..., DWORD& LastErrorOut, SIZE_T CountOfOkErrors, va_list OkErrors)
{
    LastErrorOut = NO_ERROR;
    HANDLE h = CreateFileW(...);
    if (h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    {
        LastErrorOut = GetLastError();
        if (LastErrorOut not in OkErrors)
            Throw...;
    }
    return h;
}

The wrappers are generated via the mysterious genthnk tool.

The files are not as clear as I would like, but adding new wrappers has been made as painless as possible,
given the mysterious genthnk tool..

@NL -- newline
[IFunc] -- iterated function, evaluated for every function
[EFunc] -- exception function, replace IFunc
[Code] --
[Template] --
[Macros] -- arbitrary reusable pieces
@Indent --

Any questions, see JayKrell.

\h  Introduction The application verifier prints messages formatted like below before breaking into debugger. VERIFIER STOP stop-code: pid process-PID: description message parameter-1: description parameter-2: description parameter-3: description parameter-4: description Here it is an example of a verifier stop for an application that caused an access violation. =========================================================== VERIFIER STOP 00000002: pid 668: access violation exception         C0C0C0C0 : Invalid address being accessed         780034D2 : Code performing invalid access         0006F9B0 : .exr (exception record)         0006F9CC : .cxr (context record) =========================================================== For every code we have added a frequency field that gives an indication of how often we have encountered that type of bug. The categories are: zero, very low, low, average, high and very high. The stop code values can belong to the following ranges: 0000   01FF general errors and heap verifier 0100   02FF invalid system calls 0200   02FF   critical section verifier 0300   03FF   handle checking 0400   04FF   COM verifier 0500   1000    reserved 1000   2000 application compatibility 2000 -  future extensions There is a unique description message associated with each stop code. The only exception is for the CORRUPTED_HEAP_BLOCK stop which can have several different descriptions based on the type of corruption detected. There are bugs for which application verifier cannot crash in a controlled manner. For example if stack extensions are disabled this will cause stack overflow exceptions and this is how the crash will manifest. No verifier stop message will be displayed. All these special cases are described in the  Other crashes  section. Heap verifier Code 0001: UNKNOWN_ERROR Message:  process heap list count is wrong Parameter 1:   RESERVED Parameter 2: RESERVED Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: This message can happen if while calling GetProcessHeaps() interface the page heap manager detects some internal inconsistencies. This can be caused by some random corruption in the process space. Code 0002: ACCESS_VIOLATION Message:  access violation exception Parameter 1:   Invalid address causing the exception Parameter 2: Code address executing the invalid access Parameter 3: Exception record  Parameter 4:  Context record Frequency: very high This is the most common application verifier stop. Typically it is caused by a buffer overrun error. The heap verifier places a non-accessible page at the end of a heap allocation and a buffer overrun will cause an exception by touching this page. To debug this stop identify the access address that caused the exception and then use the following debugger command: !heap  a ACCESS_ADDRESS : this command will give details about the nature of the error and what heap block is overrun. It will also give the stack trace for the block allocation. There are several other causes for this stop. For example accessing a heap block after being freed. The same debugger command will be useful for this case too. For more information about the structure of a heap block please read the  The structure of a heap block  section from this manual. Code 0003: UNSYNCHRONIZED_ACCESS Message:  multithreaded access in HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE heap Parameter 1:   Heap in which operation happens Parameter 2: Thread ID for current owner of the heap critical section Parameter 3: Thread ID of current thread trying to enter Parameter 4:  Frequency: A heap created with HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE flag is not supposed to be accessed simultaneously from two threads. If such a situation is detected you will get this message. The typical way this situation creeps into a program is by linking with a single-threaded version of the C-runtime. Visual C++ can for instance link statically such a library when proper flags are used. Then people forget about this detail and use multiple threads. The bug is very difficult to debug in real life because it will show up as mysterious data corruptions. Code 0004: EXTREME_SIZE_REQUEST Message:  extreme size request Parameter 1:   Heap in which operation happens Parameter 2: Size requested Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: very low This message will be generated if in a HeapAlloc() or HeapReAlloc() operation the size of the block is above any reasonable value. Typically this value is 0x80000000 on 32-bit platforms and a lot bigger on 64-bit platforms. Code 0005: BAD_HEAP_HANDLE Message:  heap handle with incorrect signature Parameter 1:   Heap handle used in the call to a heap interface Parameter 2: Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: The heap structures are tagged with a magic value. If the heap handle used in the call to a heap interface does not have this pattern then this stop will be generated. This bug can happen if somehow the internal heap structure got corrupted (random corruption) or simply a bogus value is used as a heap handle. To get a list of valid heap handle values use the following debugger commands: !heap  Note that if you just switch a valid heap handle with another valid one in a heap operation you will not get this stop (the handle looks valid after all). However the heap verifier detects this situation and reports it with stop CORRUPTED_HEAP_BLOCK. Code 0006: SWITCHED_HEAP_HANDLE This stop code is reserved for future extensions. A switched heap handle is reported in the current version of the application verifier with stop code CORRUPTED_HEAP_BLOCK and the description  corrupted heap pointer or using wrong heap Code 0007: DOUBLE_FREE This stop code is reserved for future extensions. A switched heap handle is reported in the current version of the application verifier with stop code CORRUPTED_HEAP_BLOCK and the description  block already freed Code 0008: CORRUPTED_HEAP_BLOCK This verifier stop occurs in several situations. Each has a different description message. If the debugging information presented for each variant does not suffice please read the section that describes the structure of a heap block. It contains many additional debugging tips. As a general rule for each of these stops use the !heap  a HEAP_BLOCK_ADDRESS debugger command to get an idea about the nature of the address passed to a heap interface. Message:  exception raised while verifying block header  Parameter 1:  Heap handle for the heap owning the block Parameter 2:  Heap block that is corrupted Parameter 3:  Size of the block or zero if size cannot be determined Parameter 4:  RESERVED Frequency: Average This situation happens if we really cannot determine any particular type of corruption for the block. For instance you will get this if during a heap free operation you pass an address that points to a non-accessible memory area. Message:  block already freed Parameter 1:  Heap handle for the heap owning the block Parameter 2: Heap block being freed again Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4: RESERVED Frequency: This situation happens if the block is freed twice. Freed blocks are marked in a special way and are kept around for a while. If a buggy program tries to free the block again this will be caught.  Message:  corrupted infix pattern for freed block Parameter 1:  Heap handle for the heap owning the block Parameter 2: Heap block being freed again Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4: RESERVED Frequency: Freed blocks are sometimes marked non-accessible and a program touching them will access violate (different verifier stop). In other cases (light page heap) the block is marked with a magic pattern and will be kept for a while. Eventually in a FIFO fashion the blocks get really freed. At this moment the infix pattern is checked and if it has been modified you will get this break. The stack at the break moment is not relevant. You need to find out the nature of the block and code review the code that might be wrong. Please read  The structure of a heap block  section  for debugging tips. Message:  corrupted heap pointer or using wrong heap Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4: Heap that actually owns the block Frequency: Average Most typically this happens if a block gets allocated in one heap and freed in another. Use !heap  p command to get a list of all valid heap handle values. Message:  corrupted suffix pattern Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  RESERVED Frequency: very high Most typically this happens for buffer overrun errors. Sometimes the application verifier places non-accessible pages at the end of the allocation and buffer overruns will cause an access violation and sometimes the heap block is followed by a magic pattern. If this pattern is changed when the block gets freed you will get this break. These breaks can be quite difficult to debug because you do not have the actual moment when corruption happened. You just have access to the free moment (stop happened here) and the allocation stack trace (!heap  a HEAP_ADDRESS) Message:  corrupted prefix pattern Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  RESERVED Frequency: This happens for buffer underruns. Read  The structure of a heap block  section for more information. Message:  corrupted start stamp Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  Corrupted stamp value Frequency: This happens for buffer underruns. Read  The structure of a heap block  section for more information. Message:  corrupted end stamp Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  Corrupted stamp value Frequency: This happens for buffer underruns. Read  The structure of a heap block  section for more information. Message:  exception raised while verifying block Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  RESERVED Frequency: average This situation happens if we really cannot determine any particular type of corruption for the block. For instance you will get this if during a heap free operation you pass an address that points to a non-accessible memory area. This can also happen for double free situations if we do not find the block among full page heap blocks and we probe it as a light page heap block. Read  The structure of a heap block  section for more information. Message:  corrupted heap block Parameter 1:  Heap handle used in the call Parameter 2: Heap block involved in the operation Parameter 3: Size of the heap block Parameter 4:  RESERVED Frequency: This is a catch all generic message if we cannot classify the error in any of the above categories. Code 0009: DESTROY_PROCESS_HEAP Message:  attempt to destroy process heap Parameter 1:   Heap handle used with HeapDestroy Parameter 2: Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: very low It is illegal to try to destroy the default process heap (the one returned by GetProcessHeap() interface). Code 000A: UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION Message:  unexpected exception raised in heap code path Parameter 1:   Heap involved in the operation Parameter 2: Exception code (C0000005   access violation) Parameter 3: Exception record (TBD update code) Parameter 4:  Context record (TBD update code) Frequency: This stop is generated if while executing the heap manager code an access violation is raised in illegitimate situations. There are very few situations where this is ok, for example when calling HeapValidate() or HeapSize(). The exception record information (third parameter) can be used to find the exact context of the exception. Use the following debugger commands for this: dd parameter2 L2 .exr first_dword .cxr second_dword Usually this stop can happen if there is some random corruption in the internal heap structures. Lock verifier Code 0200: EXIT_THREAD_OWNS_LOCK Message:  Thread is in a state in which it cannot own a critical section Parameter 1:   Thread identifier Parameter 2: Critical section address Parameter 3: Critical section debug information address. Parameter 4:  Critical section initialization stack trace.  Frequency: This stop is generated if a thread (thread ID is parameter1) is terminated, suspended or is in a state (worker thread finished a work item) in which it cannot hold a critical section. The current thread is the culprit. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands:  to get the current stack trace. If the current thread is the owner of the critical section it is probably calling ExitThread. The current thread should have released the critical section before exiting. If the current thread is calling TerminateThread or SuspendThread then it should not do this for a thread holding a critical section.  s parameter2 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter2   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the leaked critical section. dds parameter4   to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization. Code 0201: LOCK_IN_UNLOADED_DLL Message:  unloading dll containing active critical section Parameter 1:   Critical section address Parameter 2: Critical section initialization stack trace. Parameter 3: DLL name address Parameter 4:  DLL base address Frequency: This stop is generated if a DLL has a global variable containing a critical section and the DLL is unloaded but the critical section has not been deleted. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands: du parameter3   to dump the name of the culprit DLL. .reload dllname or .reload dllname = parameter4 - to reload the symbols for that DLL. s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the leaked critical section. dds parameter2   to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization. Code 0202: LOCK_IN_FREED_HEAP Message:  releasing heap allocation containing active critical section Parameter 1:   Critical section address Parameter 2: Critical section initialization stack trace. Parameter 3: Heap block address Parameter 4:  Heap block size Frequency: This stop is generated if a heap allocation contains a critical section, the allocation is freed and the critical section has not been deleted. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands: s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the leaked critical section. dds parameter2   to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization. parameter3 and parameter4 might help understand where was this heap block allocated (the size of the allocation is probably significant). Code 0203: LOCK_DOUBLE_INITIALIZE Message:  double initialized or corrupted critical section Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Address of the debug information structure found in the active list. Parameter 3: First initialization stack trace. Parameter 4:  Second initialization stack trace. Frequency: Usually this stop is generated if a critical section has been initialized more than one time. In this case parameter3 and parameter4 are the stack trace addresses for two of these initializations. Some other times it is possible to get this stop if the critical section or its debug information structure has been corrupted. In this second case it is possible that parameter3 and parameter4 are invalid and useless. To debug this stop: d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This might help identify the critical section if this is a global variable. dds parameter3 and dds parameter4 - to identify the two code paths for initializing this critical section. Code 0204: LOCK_IN_FREED_MEMORY Message:  undeleted critical section in freed memory Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Critical section debug information address. Parameter 3: Critical section initialization stack trace. Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated if the memory containing a critical section was freed but the critical section has not been deleted using DeleteCriticalSection. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands: d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section. dds parameter3 - to identify the code path for initializing this critical section. Since the lock verifier detects on the spot leaked critical sections contained in a heap allocation or a DLL range and issues different stops there are very few cases left for this verifier stop. The lock must be in a memory range allocated with VirtualAlloc() or some shared memory area created with MapViewOfFile(). Most typically this stop will  be encountered if a previous stop (LOCK_IN_FREED_HEAP or LOCK_IN_UNLOADED_DLL) was continued by hitting `g  in the debugger console. Code 0205: LOCK_CORRUPTED Message:  corrupted critical section Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Invalid debug information address of this critical section. Parameter 3: Address of the debug information found in the active list. Parameter 4:  Initialization stack trace. Frequency: This stop is generated if the DebugInfo field of the critical section is pointing freed memory. Usually another valid DebugInfo structure is found in the active critical section list. Without corruption the two pointers should be identical. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands: d parameter3 - dump information about this critical section based on the current contents of the debug info structure found in the active list (this structure is rarely corrupted so usually this information is trustworthy). s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section based on the current contents of the critical section structure (the structure is corrupted already so sometimes this information is NOT trustworthy). dds parameter4 - to identify the code path for initializing this critical section. Dump the critical section at address parameter1 and look for the corruption pattern. With good symbols for ntdll.dl you can use the following commands: dt ntdll!_RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION LOCK_ADDRESS dt ntdll!_RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION_DEBUG DEBUG_ADDRESS Code 0206: LOCK_INVALID_OWNER Message:  invalid critical section owner thread Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Owning thread. Parameter 3: Expected owning thread. Parameter 4:  Critical section debug info address. Frequency: This stop is generated if the owner thread ID is invalid in the current context. To debug this stop:  s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the critical section. Code 0207: LOCK_INVALID_RECURSION_COUNT Message:  invalid critical section owner thread Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Recursion count. Parameter 3: Expected recursion count. Parameter 4:  Critical section debug info address. Frequency: This stop is generated if the recursion count field of the critical section structure is invalid in the current context. To debug this stop:  s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the critical section. Code 0208: LOCK_INVALID_LOCK_COUNT Message:  deleting critical section with invalid lock count Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Lock count. Parameter 3: Expected lock count. Parameter 4:  Owning thread. Frequency: This stop is generated if a critical section is owned by a thread if it is deteled or if the critical section is uninitialized. To debug this stop:  s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section. If the owning thread is 0 the critical section has not been initialized. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the critical section. Code 0209: LOCK_OVER_RELEASED Message:  critical section over-released or corrupted Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Lock count. Parameter 3: Expected lock count. Parameter 4:  Critical section debug info address. Frequency: This stop is generated if a critical section is released more times than the current thread acquired it. To debug this stop:  s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.  d parameter4 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the critical section. Code 0210: LOCK_NOT_INITIALIZED Message:  critical section not initialized Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Critical section debug info address. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if a critical section is used without being initialized or after it has been deleted. To debug this stop:  ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This should help identify the critical section. Code 0211: LOCK_ALREADY_INITIALIZED Message:  reinitializing critical section Parameter 1:   Critical section address. Parameter 2: Critical section debug info address. Parameter 3: First initialization stack trace. Use dds to dump it if non-NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if a critical section is reinitialized by the current thread. To debug this stop:  s parameter1 or !cs  d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section. ln parameter1   to show symbols near the address of the critical section. This might help identify the critical section if this is a global variable. dds parameter3 - to identify the code path for the first initialization of this critical section.  to display the current stack trace, that is reinitializing this critical section. Handle checking Code 0300: INVALID_HANDLE Message:  invalid handle exception for current stack trace Parameter 1:   NULL. Parameter 2: NULL. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack passed an invalid handle to system routines. Usually a simple kb command will reveal what is the value of the handle passed (must be one of the parameters   usually the first one). If the value is null then this is clearly wrong. If the value looks ok you need to use !htrace debugger extension to get a history of operations pertaining to this handle value. In most cases it must be that the handle value is used after being closed. Code 0301: INVALID_TLS_VALUE Message:  Invalid TLS index used in current stack (use kb). Parameter 1:   Invalid TLS index. Parameter 2: Expected lower part of the index. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack passed an invalid TLS index to TLS system routines. Usually a simple kb command will reveal what is wrong. The typical bug here is to assume a certain value for a TLS index instead of calling TlsAlloc. This can happen either by thinking that you always get value N therefore there is no need to call TlsAlloc or more frequently due to an uninitialized variable.  Code 0302: INCORRECT_WAIT_CALL Message:  incorrect Wait call Parameter 1: Address of object handle(s). Parameter 2: Number of handles. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack called WaitForMultipleObjects with NULL as the address of the array of handles to wait for or with zero as the number of handles. A simple kb command will reveal the function calling this API incorrectly. Code 0303: NULL_HANDLE Message:  using NULL handle Parameter 1: NULL. Parameter 2: NULL. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack passed a NULL handle to system routines. Usually a simple kb command will reveal what is the value of the handle passed (must be one of the parameters   usually the first one).  Code 0304: WAIT_IN_DLLMAIN Message:  waiting on a thread handle in DllMain Parameter 1: Thread handle. Parameter 2: NULL. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the current thread is currently running code inside the DllMain function of one of the DLLs loaded in the current process and it calls WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects to wait on a thread handle in the same process. This would most likely lead to a deadlock because the thread handle will not get signaled unless that second thread is exiting. When the second thread will call ExitThread it will try to acquire the DLL loader lock then call DllMain (DLL_THREAD_DETACH) for all DLLs in the current process. But the loader lock is owned by the first thread (the one that is waiting on the thread handle) so the two threads will deadlock. Virtual Memory Verifier Code 0600: INVALID_FREEMEM Message:  Trying to free virtual memory block that is already free Parameter 1:   Memory block address. Parameter 2: NULL. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree for an address that is already free. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to determine why the memory is already free but the application is trying to free it again.  !avrf  a parameter1  will search for a log of stack traces of the code paths that allocated/freed that address and display these stack traces if they are available. This might show the stack trace that freed up this memory.  Message:  Freeing virtual memory block with invalid size or start address Message:  Unloading DLL with invalid size or start address Parameter 1:   Allocation base address. Parameter 2: Memory region size. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree or a DLL unload with an invalid start address or size of the memory allocation.  In the case of DLL unload this probably means a memory corruption inside the loaded DLL list.  To debug this stop look at the current stack trace and the memory address and size that is about to be freed and try to determine why they are invalid. Message:  Freeing heap memory block inside current thread's stack address range Message:  Freeing memory block inside current thread's stack address range Message:  Unmapping memory region inside current thread's stack address range Parameter 1:   Allocation base address. Parameter 2: Memory region size. Parameter 3: Stack low limit address. Parameter 4:  Stack high limit address. Frequency: This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a HeapFree, VirtualFree or UnmapViewOfFile for a block of memory that is actually part of the current thread s stack (!). To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to understand why the function that called HeapFree, VirtualFree ot UnmapViewOfFile thought that the memory block was dynamically allocated or mapped but that was actually memory allocated from the stack.  Message:  Unloading DLL inside current thread's stack address range Parameter 1:   Allocation base address Parameter 2: Memory region size Parameter 3: DLL name address. Use du to dump it. Parameter 4:  Stack low limit address. Frequency: very low Same as the above break but this usually means a memory corruption inside the loaded DLL list. The stack high limit address can be found using !teb (it is the StackBase field). Code 0601: INVALID_ALLOCMEM Message:  Incorrect virtual alloc call Parameter 1:   Pointer to allocation base address. Parameter 2: Pointer to memory region size. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  Frequency: very low This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualAlloc call with an invalid start address or size of the memory allocation. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and the memory address and size that is about to be allocated and try to determine why they are invalid. Code 0602: INVALID_MAPVIEW Message:  Incorrect map view call Parameter 1:   Pointer to mapping base address. Parameter 2: Pointer to view size. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  Frequency: very low This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a MapViewOfFile call with an invalid base address or size of the mapping. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and the memory address and size that is about to be mapped and try to determine why they are invalid. COM verifier Code 0401: COM_API_IN_DLLMAIN Message:  COM API or Proxy called from DllMain Parameter 1:   NULL. Parameter 2: NULL. Parameter 3: NULL. Parameter 4:  NULL. Frequency: This stop is generated when a COM Proxy or a dangerous COM API is called with the loader lock held.  This is simple to debug  a simple kb will show the stack of the misbehaving DLL.  The DLL should remove its call to the COM API in question. Code 0402: COM_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION Message:  Unhandled exception in COM call Parameter 1:   Exception pointers for exception. Parameter 2: Object being called on. Parameter 3: Pointer to IID being called on. Parameter 4:  Method number being called on. Frequency: This stop is generated if, while processing a COM call, the object being invoked raises an exception.  The exception record information (first parameter) can be used to find the exact context of the exception. Use the following debugger commands for this: dd parameter1 L2 .exr first_dword .cxr second_dword Sometimes we know the exact object we called into that raised the error.  In these cases, the second parameter will point to the interface pointer we tried to call on.  The third and fourth parameters will indicate which interface and method we think we called on, as well. Code 0403: COM_UNBALANCED_COINIT Message:  Varies Parameter 1:   Current number of CoInitialize calls on this thread. Parameter 2: Previous number of CoInitialize calls on this thread. Parameter 3: Stack trace of most recent CoInitialize call on this thread. Parameter 4:  Stack trace of most recent CoUninitialize call on this thread. Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that there has been an unbalanced call to CoInitialize on this thread.  Causes for this include exiting a thread with outstanding CoInitialize calls on it, calling CoInitialize without calling CoUninitialize, or calling CoUninitialize without calling CoInitialize.  The stacks of the most recent CoInitialize and CoUninitialize calls may be present in the third and fourth parameters.  If they exist, they may help to locate the culprit. Code 0404: COM_UNBALANCED_OLEINIT Message:  Varies Parameter 1:   Current number of OleInitialize calls on this thread. Parameter 2: Previous number of OleInitialize calls on this thread. Parameter 3: Stack trace of most recent OleInitialize call on this thread. Parameter 4:  Stack trace of most recent OleUninitialize call on this thread. Frequency: Very Low This stop is identical to the COM_UNBALANCED_COINIT stop, except that it applies to unbalanced calls to OleInitialize and OleUninitialize. Code 0405: COM_UNBALANCED_SWC Message:  Varies Parameter 1:   Current COM object context Parameter 2: Stack trace of most recent CoEnterServiceDomain call on this thread. Parameter 3: Stack trace of most recent CoLeaveServiceDomain call on this thread. Parameter 4:  Frequency: Very Low This stop is generated when COM detects that there has been an unbalanced call to CoEnterServiceDomain on this thread.  Causes for this include exiting a thread with outstanding CoEnterServiceDomain calls on it, calling CoEnterServiceDomain without calling CoLeaveServiceDomain, or calling CoLeaveServiceDomain without calling CoEnterServiceDomain.  The stacks of the most recent CoEnterServiceDomain and CoLeaveServiceDomain calls may be present in the second and third parameters.  If they exist, they may help to locate the culprit. Code 0406: COM_NULL_DACL Message:  Calling CoInitializeSecurity with a NULL DACL Parameter 1:   Security Descriptor that was used for CoInitializeSecurity Parameter 2: Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that DCOM security is being initialized with a security descriptor containing a NULL DACL.  A NULL DACL for COM means that anybody can call any of your objects.  While not functionally different from supplying no security descriptor at all, the rationale behind this stop is that if you went through all the trouble to create a security descriptor with a NULL DACL, you must think you re getting something you re not. To debug this, look at the call stack.  The security descriptor can come from one of the following places: The calling code could pass it in directly.  If the security descriptor is being supplied directly by the function calling CoInitializeSecurity, then that code needs to be corrected.   CoInitializeSecurity could be reading the values out of the AppID key specified in the call to CoInitializeSecurity.  In this case, the specific application configuration needs to be fixed. CoInitializeSecurity could be reading the values out of the AppID key associated with the current EXE.  Again, the specific application configuration needs to be fixed. CoInitializeSecurity could be using the global default access permissions.  This indicates a machine-wide misconfiguration.  The administrator should fix the machine-wide settings. Code 0407: COM_UNSAFE_IMPERSONATION Message:  SYSTEM Process allowing impersonation by default Parameter 1:   Process token Parameter 2: Default impersonation level Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a process running as SYSTEM is initializing DCOM security with an impersonation level of RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE or better.  This means that, by default, any COM call made grants the callee the right to impersonate SYSTEM.    To debug this, look at the call stack.  Either the caller is passing the unsafe impersonation level directly to CoInitializeSecurity, or the impersonation level is being read out of the registry, from the AppID key associated with the current process. Code 0408: COM_SMUGGLED_WRAPPER Message:  A COM+ Proxy was called from the wrong context. Parameter 1:   Pointer to IID of interface being called on. Parameter 2: Method number being called. Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Pointer to the COM+ proxy that was smuggled. Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a user has tried to call a COM+ proxy from the wrong object context.  In general, COM+ proxies have affinity to the context that they were unmarshalled in, and must only be called from those contexts. To debug, look at the call stack.  The caller of the proxy (the code before ole32.dll) needs to check to make sure that they correctly unmarshalled that interface pointer into the current context. Code 0409: COM_SMUGGLED_PROXY Message:  A COM Proxy was called from the wrong context. Parameter 1:   Pointer to IID of interface being called on. Parameter 2: Method number being called. Parameter 3: The apartment that the proxy is valid in. Parameter 4:  The current apartment. Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a user has tried to call a COM proxy from the wrong apartment or context.  In general, COM objects have affinity to the apartment and context that they were unmarshalled in, and must only be called from those places. To debug, look at the call stack, and parameters three and four.  Parameter four indicates the apartment that the proxy is valid in, and parameter three indicates the apartment that the current call stack is in.  The apartment values are interpreted as follows: If the number is 0, then the apartment is the MTA. If the number is 0xFFFFFFFF, then the apartment is the NA. Otherwise, the number is the thread ID of an STA. If the numbers match, this indicates that the proxy was smuggled to a different COM+ object context.  In this case, treat this stop as a COM_SMUGGLED_WRAPPER stop. The most common cause of this error is putting an interface pointer into a global variable and using it from more than one thread. Code 040A: COM_CF_SUCCESS_WITH_NULL Message:  A class factory has returned success, but with a NULL object Parameter 1:   Pointer to the class factory Parameter 2: Pointer to the CLSID being created Parameter 3: Pointer to the IID being requested Parameter 4:  The HRESULT returned Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a class factory has returned a success HRESULT from IClassFactory::CreateInstance(), but has returned NULL in the ppv argument.  This is always a bug in the implementation of the class factory. To debug, examine the implementation of the class factory.  Information about which class and interface were being requested is available from the second and third parameters.  The first parameter is the pointer that ole called on, so you can dump that to examine the state of the class factory in question.  Finally, the HRESULT might be something strange when it was supposed to be an error the fourth parameter will tell you what was actually returned from the class factory. Code 040B: COM_GCO_SUCCESS_WITH_NULL Message:  A call to DllGetClassObject has returned success, but with a NULL object Parameter 1:   Name of the DLL whose DllGetClassObject we called. Parameter 2: Pointer to the CLSID being created Parameter 3: Pointer to the IID being requested Parameter 4:  The HRESULT returned Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a call to DllGetClassObject has returned a success HRESULT, but a NULL class factory.  This is always a bug in the implementation of the DllGetClassObject function. To debug, examine the implementation of the DllGetClassObject function in the DLL named by parameter 1.  Information about which class and interface were being requested is available from the second and third parameters.  Finally, the HRESULT might be something strange when it was supposed to be an error the fourth parameter will tell you what was actually returned from the function. Code 040C: COM_OBJECT_IN_FREED_MEMORY Message:  Freeing memory containing marshaled COM object Parameter 1:   Pointer to the COM object in the block of memory Parameter 2: Pointer to the start of the memory block being freed Parameter 3: Size of the memory block Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a block of memory is being freed that contains a COM object.  This is generally the result of freeing a COM object that still has outstanding marshaled references to it (i.e., COM is still holding a stub alive for the object).  It indicates a reference counting bug for the object in question.   To debug, use  ln poi <parameter 1>  to identify the VTBL of the COM object being freed.  Examine the implementation and clients of the COM object for obvious reference counting problems.  Unfortunately, debugging reference counting problems is difficult, as it generally requires putting a breakpoint on the AddRef() and Release() implementations for this kind of object and reproducing the problem. Code 040D: COM_OBJECT_IN_UNLOADED_DLL Message:  Unloading a DLL containing marshaled COM object Parameter 1:   Pointer to the COM object in the block of memory Parameter 2: The name of the DLL being freed Parameter 3: The base address of the DLL Parameter 4:  Frequency: Very Low This stop is generated when COM detects that a DLL is being unloaded which contains a COM object.  As this stop is only issued when unmapping a DLL from memory, the COM object in question is almost always a global object or a singleton.  Therefore, this stop indicates a bug in the DLLs DllCanUnloadNow implementation.   To debug, use  ln poi <parameter 1>  to identify the VTBL of the COM object being freed, and  du <parameter 2>  to identify the DLL.  Examine the implementation of the DLL s DllCanUnloadNow function, and make sure that the DLL always returns S_FALSE when there are still active objects in the DLL.  The other possible cause of this is a DLL handle reference counting bug.  If the current stack does not indicate that ole32 is unloading the DLL, then check to make sure that the code unloading the DLL actually has a valid module handle. Code 040E: COM_VTBL_IN_FREED_MEMORY Message:  Freeing memory containing implementation of marshaled COM object. Parameter 1:   The object VTBL Parameter 2: The address of the start of the memory block. Parameter 3: The size of the memory block. Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated when COM detects that a block of memory is being freed which contains a VTBL (i.e., the implementation) for a COM object.  This is extremely rare in general, it only happens when code is generated dynamically into memory, or code is mapped into memory with a mechanism other than LoadLibrary().  As such, this stop usually indicates a problem in a runtime (i.e., in a VM) that is implementing the COM object.   To debug, dump the memory block and see if it has useful information in it.  To be perfectly honest, this stop has never hit, and is only included for completeness and symmetry.  If this ever hits, and you know the code in question is using the CLR or JVM, then probably the page heap information on the block will give the best information for debugging this. Code 040F: COM_VTBL_IN_UNLOADED_DLL Message:  Unloading a DLL containing implementation of a marshaled COM object. Parameter 1:   The object VTBL Parameter 2: The name of the DLL being freed Parameter 3: The base address of the DLL Parameter 4:  Frequency: Very Low This stop is generated when COM detects that a DLL is being unloaded which contains a VTBL (i.e., the implementation) for a COM object.  This is generally the result of unloading a DLL that implements one or more COM objects that still have outstanding marshaled references to them (i.e., COM is still holding a stub alive for objects implemented in this DLL).  As this stop is only issued when unmapping a DLL from memory, this stop indicates a bug in the DLLs DllCanUnloadNow implementation.   To debug, use  ln <parameter 1>  to identify the VTBL of the COM object being freed, and  du <parameter 2>  to identify the DLL.  Examine the implementation of the DLL s DllCanUnloadNow function, and make sure that the DLL always returns S_FALSE when there are still active objects in the DLL.   Code 0410: COM_HOLDING_LOCKS_ON_CALL Message:  A lock is being held across a COM call (examine the current stack) Parameter 1:   Parameter 2: Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: Very High This stop is generated when COM detects that a critical section is being held across a remote (i.e., at least cross-thread) COM call.  This is not a bug, per se, it s usually just a bad design.  First of all, callbacks to the object on a different thread have a good chance of deadlocking.  Second of all, there is no way of knowing how long the remote call is going to block, so holding the lock across the call is generally very bad from a scalability and performance point of view. To debug, look at the stack, and use the !locks debugger extention to figure out which locks this thread is holding. RPC verifier Code 0500: RPC_ERROR Message:  Possible security threat: An unsecure interface becomes remotely accessible Message: Possible security threat: Server is forced to listen on all interfaces circumventing the firewall Message: Possible security threat: Server that is remotely accessible is registering an unsecure interface Message: Possible security threat: Client is calling a remote endpoint without RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY Message: Possible security threat: Client is calling a remote endpoint without mutual authentication Parameter 1:   Parameter 2: Parameter 3: Parameter 4:  Frequency: This stop is generated if a component uses RPC in such a way as to create security vulnerabilities.  The user code in the current thread is the culprit. The stop does not cause a debug break and machine needs to be broken-into prior to debugging. The stop message is followed by some debugging information.  To debug this stop use the following debugger commands: Ctrl-C or PrintScr   to break into the machine. !process pid 0   to get the address ADDR of the faulting process; here pid is the faulting process id displayed in the verifier stop message. .process ADDR   to switch into the context of the faulting process. After the verifier stop message RPC will print the dump of the stack that has caused the stop.  The printout will be preceded by:  RPC: Offending Stack: .  In the context of the faulting process, do an   on the displayed stack addresses to get the corresponding symbols. If the faulting stack is not displayed or in addition to it, RPC will print some information identifying the faulting user code or component.  These massages begin with   and contain interface UUID s and other useful information: =========================================================== VERIFIER STOP 00000500: pid 0x3A4: Possible security threat: An unsecure interface becomes remotely accessible         00000000 : (null)         00000000 : (null)         00000000 : (null)         00000000 : (null) =========================================================== RPC: Starting to listen on protsec: ncacn_ip_tcp endpoint: (null) RPC: Unsecure interface UUID: 621dff68-3c39-4c6c-aae3-e68e2c6503ad RPC: Unsecure interface UUID: 00000134-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 RPC: Unsecure interface UUID: 18f70770-8e64-11cf-9af1-0020af6e72f4 RPC: Unsecure interface UUID: 00000131-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 In the above example, the owners of the interfaces that have not been secured are at fault. Other crashes There are several types of bugs for which application verifier cannot crash in a controlled manner. This section describes these cases. Dirty stacks Application verifier periodically dirties the unused portions of the stack with the value BAD1BAD1. If the application crashed with an access to the BAD1BAD1 address it is very likely that it has code that assumes a local variable was initialized. The investigation should start with the top function that crashed accessing this bogus value. Stack overflows Application verifier by default disables stack extensions. This exposes a weakness in a process that is prone to getting stack overflows under memory pressure. If an application has this bug it will crash with a stack overflow exception (0xC00000FD). There will not be any verifier stop message.  The structure of a heap block The heap verifier uses internally two heap managers: the full page heap manager and the light page heap manager. Full page heap blocks have always a non-accessible page at the end of the allocation. Such allocations use a minimum of two pages and therefore using full page heap tends to be memory demanding. This is the default setting when application verifier is enabled. To accommodate memory demanding applications the heap verifier can be controlled to direct some of the allocations to the light page heap manager which requires only a few extra bytes for each allocation. Therefore at any instant a process can have two types of heap blocks: full page heap blocks and light page heap blocks. Their internal structure is useful in debugging complicated failures. Light page heap block structure Full page heap block structure The suffix pattern for full page heap blocks is required if the block size is not a multiple of the guaranteed alignment for the start address (8 bytes on x86 platforms and 16 bytes on 64-bit platforms). Since the start address must be a multiple of the guaranteed alignment we cannot simultaneously insure that the end of the block is page aligned. The information block has the following structure: DPH_BLOCK_INFORMATION  ULONG  StartStamp; PVOID  Heap; SIZE_T  RequestedSize; SIZE_T  ActualSize; LIST_ENTRY  FreeQueue; PVOID  StackTrace; ULONG  EndStamp; The Heap field stores the owning heap. The user requested size for the block is in RequestedSize. The stack can be obtained by issuing a dds debugger command at StackTrace address. The best way to get a dump of this structure in Whistler is to use the dt debugger command: dt ntdll!DPH_BLOCK_INFORMATION ADDRESS For Windows2000 Service Pack builds a dd debugger command must be used. The StackTrace field will not always contain a non-null value for various reasons. First of all stack trace detection is supported only on x86 platforms and second, even on x86 machines the stack trace detection algorithms are not completely reliable. If the block is an allocated block the stack trace is for the allocation moment. If the block was freed, the stack trace is for the free moment. Debugging application verifier failures The heap verifier debugger extension The heap verifier debugger extension is part of the !heap extension (NT heap debugger extension). Simple help can be obtained with !heap -?, or more extensive with !heap  p -?. The current extension does not detect on its own if page heap is enabled for a process and act accordingly. For now the user of the extension needs to know that page heap is enabled and use commands prefixed by !heap  !heap  Dumps addresses of all full page heaps created in the process. !heap  h ADDRESS-OF-HEAP Full dump of full page heap at ADDRESS-OF-HEAP. !heap  a ADDRESS Tries to figure out if there is a heap block at ADDRESS. This value does not need to be the address of the start of the block. The command is useful if there is no clue whatsoever about the nature of a memory area. !heap  t NUMBER This command dumps the first NUMBER heavy users of heap allocations. This command is useful for leak analysis. Typical debug scenarios There are several failure scenarios that might be encountered. Some of them require quite a bit of detective work to get the whole picture. Access violation in non-accessible page This happens when full page heap is enabled if the tested application accesses beyond the end of buffer. It can also happen if it touches a freed block. In order to understand what is the nature of the address on which the exception happened you need to use: !heap  a ADDRESS-OF-AV Corrupted block message At several moments during the lifetime of an allocation (allocation, user free, real free) the page heap manager checks if the block has all fill patterns intact and the block header has consistent data. If this is not the case you will get a verifier stop. If this is a full page heap block (for example if you know for sure full page heap is enabled for all allocations) then you can use  !heap  a ADDRESS  to find out what are the characteristics of the block. If it is a light page heap block then you need to find out the start address for the block header. This can be achieved by dumping 30-40 bytes below the reported address and look for the magic start/end patterns for a block header (ABCDAAAA, ABCDBBBB, ABCDAAA9, ABCDBBBA   see subsection  The structure of a heap block ). The header will give all the information you need to understand the failure. Particularly the magic patterns will tell if the block is allocated or free, if it is a light page heap or a full page heap block. The information here has to be matched carefully with the offending call. For example if a call to HeapFree is made with the address of a block plus four bytes then you will get the corrupted message. The block header will look fine but you will have to notice that the first byte after the end of the header (first byte after 0xDCBAXXXX magic value) has a different address then the one in the call. Special fill pointers The page heap manager fills the user allocation with values that will look as kernel pointers. This happens when the block gets freed (fill value is F0) and when the block gets allocated but no request is made for the block to be zeroed (fill value is E0 for light page heap and C0 for full page heap). The non-zeroed allocations are typical for malloc/new users. If there is a failure (access violation) where a read/write is attempted at addresses like F0F0F0F0, E0E0E0E0, C0C0C0C0 then most probably you hit one of these cases.  A read/write at F0F0F0F0 means a block has been used after it got freed. Unfortunately you will need some detective work to find out which block caused this. You need to get the stack trace of the failure and then inspect the code for the functions on the stack. One of them might make a wrong assumption about an allocation being alive. A read/write at E0E0E0E0/C0C0C0C0 means the application did not initialize properly the allocation. This requires also code inspection of the functions in the current stack trace. Here it is an example for this kind of failure. In a test process we noticed an access violation while doing a HeapFree on address E0E0E0E0. It turned out that the test allocated a structure, did not initialize it correctly and then called the destructor of the object. Since a certain field was not null (it had E0E0E0E0 in it) it called delete on it. !cs debugger extension !cs can be used in both user-mode debugger and kernel debugger to display information about critical sections in the current process. Matching symbols with type information is required, especially for ntdll.dll. The syntax for this extension is: cs [-s]              - dump all the active critical sections in the current process. !cs [-s] address      - dump critical section at this address. !cs [-s] -d address   - dump critical section corresponding to DebugInfo at this address. -s will dump the critical section initialization stack trace if it's available.

This information is available if handle tracing is enabled for the process   automatically enabled if handle checking is enabled in the application verifier. Stack traces are saved every time the process is opening or closing a handle or when it is referencing an invalid handle.  The kernel debugger syntax for this extension is: !htrace [ handle [process] ]     If handle is not specified or is 0, information about all the handles in the process will be displayed. If process is not specified, the current process will be used. The user-mode debugger syntax is: !htrace [handle]  The user-mode debugger extension always displays information about the current debugee process.
