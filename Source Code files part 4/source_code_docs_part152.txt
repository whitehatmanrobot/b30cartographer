Video DMA Support Design Note

    The video port needs to expose the following apis:

        1)  PUBLIC
            BOOLEAN
            VideoPortDoDma(
                IN PVOID                        HwDeviceExtension,
                IN PVIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET        pVrp
                );

            This function:
                a) allocates the MDL associated with the InputBuffer
                contained in the pVrp.
                b) maps the buffers if required by the hardware
                c) flushes the system buffers for cache coherency
                d)computes the number of map registers requested
                and checks that this number satisfies system requirements
                e) saves some parameters needed for subsequent
                Io calls such as the associated virtual MDL address, the
                number of map registers
                f) calls IoAllocateAdapterChannel, providiong a callback which
                builds the scatter gather list.

            Requirements: A mechanism to save the arguments to IoMapTransfer
            and a mechanism to indicate that a DPC is to be scheduled. The
            argments to IoMapTransfer are:

                PADAPTER_OBJECT     pAO
                    Returned from a call to HalGetAdapter and stored
                    in the DEVICE_EXTENSION.
                    If the actual transfer is desired, this is non NULL.
                    If only the physical address is desired, this parameter
                    can be NULL.

                PMDL                pMdl
                    Extracted from irp returned from
                    IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest. (also possible to get irp
                    from IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest).

                PVOID               pMapRegisterBase
                    Allocated via ExAllocatePool from nonpaged pool of length
                    dependent on bus type. Filled by Io subsystem via a call
                    to HalGetBusData and held in the video ports
                    DEVICE_EXTENSION.

                PVOID               pCurrentVirtualAddress
                    Constructed from LogicalAddress and
                    MmGetMdlVirtualAddress(Irp->MdlAddress).

                PULONG              pLength
                    Pointer to amount to be transferred. Value saved in
                    PUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK.

                BOOLEAN             WriteToDevice
                    Always set for video.

    2)      PVOID
            VideoPortGetCommonBuffer(
                IN  PVOID                       HwDeviceExtension,
                IN  PVIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET       pVrp,
                IN  ULONG                       Length,
                OUT PPHYSICAL_ADDRESS           pLogicalAddress,
                IN  BOOLEAN                     CacheEnabled
                );

    This routine allows the miniport to allocate a common buffer in
    which to store miniport specific data.

    3)      PVOID
            VideoPortGetCommonBuffer(
                IN  PVOID                       HwDeviceExtension,
                IN  PVIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET       pVrp,
                IN  ULONG                       Length,
                OUT PPHYSICAL_ADDRESS           pLogicalAddress,
                IN  BOOLEAN                     CacheEnabled
                );

    This routine allows the miniport to allocate a common buffer in
    which to store miniport specific data. This buffer is visible both to the
    system and the device and appears contiguous to the device.


    In support of each of these functions, the following can be added to the
    DEVICE_EXTENSION video port data structure:

        PVOID           MapRegisterBase
        PADAPTER_OBJECT pDmaAdapterObject
        DMA_PARAMETERS  FlushDmaParameters
        DMA_PARAMETERS  MapTransferParameters
        PHW_DMA_STARTED HwDmaStarted
        BOOLEAN         bMapBuffers

    where
            MapRegisterBase is as specified above.
            PADAPTER_OBJECT is defined by Io subsystem
            DMA_PARAMETERS, is of the form

            typedef struct  __DMA_PARAMETERS    {
                PPUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK     pVideoRequestBlock;
                PIRP                            pIrp;
                ULONG                           DataOffset;
                ULONG                           VRBFlags;
                PVOID                           pMapRegisterBase;
                ULONG                           NumberOfMapRegisters;
                PVOID                           pLogicalAddress;
                ULONG                           Length;
                PVOID                           MdlAddress;
                PVRB_SG                         pScatterGather;
                VRB_SG                          SGList[17];
            }   DMA_PARAMETERS, *PDMA_PARAMETERS;

    which needs to be a field of the Parameters field of the IrpStack as well
    as a field in the interrupt data owned by the miniport and where
    PPUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK may be defined by

            typedef struct __PUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK {
                // Private stuff.
                PIRP                    pIrp;
                ULONG                   VRBFlags;
                ULONG                   Qindex;
                // Public stuff.
                VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET    vrp;
                BOOLEAN                 bUnlock;
                } PUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK, *PPUBLIC_VIDEO_REQUEST_BLOCK;


    with VRB_SG defined by

            typedef struct __VRB_SG {
                int64   PhysicalAddress;
                ULONG   Length;
                } VRB_SG, *PVRB_SG;

    Useful flags for VRBFlags in DMA_PARAMETERS:
        DMA_FLUSH_ADAPTER
        MAP_DMA_TRANSFER
        FREE_SG
        NOTIFY_REQUIRED.

    Also in PORT_CONFIG_INFO, the following are required:
        ULONG       DmaChannel
        ULONG       DmaPort
        DMA_WIDTH   DmaWidth
        DMA_SPEED   DmaSpeed
        BOOLEAN     DMA32bitAddresses
        BOOLEAN     DMADemandMode


    One of the dependencies that supporting DMA transfers has in NT is calling
    IoAllocateAdapterChannel.

    This routine is of the form:

        NTSTATUS
        IoAllocateAdapterChannel(
            PADAPTER_OBJECT     pAO,
            PDEVICE_OBJECT      pDO,
            ULONG               NumberOfRegisters,
            PDRIVER_CONTROL     pBuildScatterGather,
            PVOID               pContext
            );

    where   pAO is returned by HalGetAdapter,
            pDO is returned by IoCreateDevice
            NumberOfRegisters comes from a calculation involving the
                DataBuffer to be transferred and it's length.
            pBuildScatterGather builds the scatter/gather list and is a
                callback from the Io subsystem.
            pContext is the context pointer passed into pBuildScatterGather
            by Io subsystem (PDMA_PARAMETERS).

    If the miniport has indicated that DMA support is desired, then the
    following sequence of system calls are made:

        MmGetMdlVirtualAddress      (to save IoMapTransfer params)
        MmGetSystemAddressForMdl    (if MapBuffers set)
        KeFlushIoBuffers
        IoAllocateAdapterChannel    (request a DPC if this fails)
        KeSynchronizeExecution
        IoMapTransfer               (note PADAPTER_OBJECT)
        IoFlushAdapterBuffers
        IoFreeMapRegisters


    The Io subsystem calls back to a routine to build scatter gather lists
    of the form:
        IO_PRIVATE
        IO_ALLOCATION_ACTION
        pVideoPortBuildScatterGather(
            PDEVICE_OBJECT      pDO,
            PIRP                pIrp,
            PVOID               pMapRegisterBase,
            PVOID               pDmaParameters
            );

    As mentioned, it builds and saves the scatter gather lists, and calls
    KeSynchronizeExecution, passing in pVideoPortStartDmaSynchronized as
    the synchronizing function. pVideoPortStartDmaSynchronized in turn calls
    HwStartDma, which is not to return until the device has finished draining
    the current request data.


    IOCTL interface

    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_INIT - set by DispDrvr
        Causes VideoPortGetCommonBuffer() to be called by miniport.

    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_TRANSFER - set by DispDrvr
        Causes VideoPortDoDma() to be called by miniport.

    VideoPortGetScatterGatherList is called from miniport.

    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_UNLOCK_PAGES - set by DispDrvr
        Causes pVideoPortUnlock to be called from videoport. Note that
        this IOCTL is private to the videoport.

Video DMA Interface.


    This note outlines a proposed interface between the display driver,
    miniport and the video port. The objective is to provide an interface
    for the display driver that optimizes DMA throughput for devices that
    support scattergather while maintaining system throughput. The design
    also optimizes locking, performing the DMA and unlocking into one
    IOCTL if desired, a significant performance win. The idea is to provide
    a handle available to the display driver that represents locked memory
    and for that handle to be returned from each DMA IOCTL request. The
    miniport fields some of theses IOCTLs and calls into the video port for
    support.

    This interface supports only PCI busmaster devices.

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    Video port to miniport interface.
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    The miniport must provide 2 things at DriverEntry time:

        A) Set Master in VIDEO_PORT_CONFIG_INFO to TRUE.
        B) Provide a callback HwStartDma() of type PVIDEO_HW_START_DMA
        in the VIDEO_HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA.

    Then the following interfaces can be used:


    The NT video port support now exports to the miniport the following
    function:

    1)      BOOLEAN
            VideoPortLockPages(
                IN      PVOID                   HwDeviceExtension,
                IN OUT  PVIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET   pVrp
                IN OUT  PEVENT                  pMappedUserEvent,
                IN      PEVENT                  pDisplayEvent,
                IN      DMA_FLAGS               DmaFlags
                );

    This routine can be called by the miniport to do busmaster DMA for
    DMA devices. It returns TRUE if successful and FALSE if not successful.
    It can only be called in the context of an IOCTL. It cannot be called
    from an ISR or DPC.

    Its arguments are:
        1) A pointer to a DEVICE_EXTENSION.
        2) A pointer to a VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET, whose OutputBuffer it may
        modify. The InputBuffer must be the virtual address of the memory
        to be locked. The InputBufferSize must be the size of that memory.
        The output buffer will receive a PDMA from which may be extracted
        a pointer to a scattergather list of physical pages which comprise
        the locked down virtual address (via GET_VIDEO_SCATTERGATHER). From
        this pointer, one can extract the physical address of any virtual
        address (see GET_VIDEO_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS).
        3) A pointer to a mapped user event, which may be set by the miniport.
        This is either a valid event returned from EngMapEvent or NULL. This
        should be received from the display driver. It will be passed into
        HwStartDma every time the resulting handle from VideoPortLockPages()
        is passed into the Video Port for a DMA operation. All events can only
        be set in the miniport, not waited on.
        4) A pointer to an event received from the display driver, intended
        to be used by the display driver to wait on DMA completion. May be
        NULL. Again, may only be set in miniport.
        This pointer to an event will also be passed into HwStartDma every
        time the resulting handle is passed into the Video Port for a DMA
        operation.
        4) An enum of type DMA_FLAGS defined in video.h. The values can be:

            a) VideoPortUnlockAfterDma
                This value should be used for a "one shot" dma action, where
                the memory is locked and a dma handle passed to HwStartDma(),
                then the memory is unlocked after the miniport signals via
                setting pDmaCompletionEvent.

            b) VideoPortKeepPagesLocked
                This value should only be used for dedicated graphics units.
                It does not guarantee that the virtual memory passed in will
                remain locked after a dma has completed, only that the system
                will try to keep it locked.

            c) VideoPortDmaInitOnly
                A typical initialization value. If used, the InputBuffer must
                contain a pointer to virtual memory. The HwStartDma will not
                be called in this case (see below). The memory will remained
                locked if possible.

    2)  PDMA
        VideoPortDoDma(
            IN      PVOID       HwDeviceExtension,
            IN      PDMA        pDma,
            IN      DMA_FLAGS   DmaFlags
            );

    Routine Description:

        This function is called by the miniport when a it has a valid DMA
        handle to cause HwStartDma to be called. It can be called outside
        the context of an IOCTL, but not from an ISR. It must execute at
        irql <= DISPATCH_LEVEL.


    Arguments:

        HwDeviceExtension - Pointer to miniport HWDeviceExtension.

        pDma              - Non - NULL DMA handle returned by this routine or
            VideoPortLockPages() in OutputBuffer.

        DmaFlags          - Flags specifying desired action.


    Return Value:

        Non NULL pDma if the corresponding memory is still locked, NULL
        otherwise.

            IN  BOOLEAN                     CacheEnabled
            );

    Routine Description:

        Provides physical address visible to both device and system. Memory seen as contiguous
        by device. This routine can only be reliably called at driver load time. Memory allocated
        must be less than 256K.

        DesiredLength       - size of desired memory (should be minimal).
        Alignment           - Desired liagnment of buffer, currently unused.

        pVirtualAddress     - unused.
        pLogicalAddress     - [out] parameter which will hold physical address of
                            of the buffer upon function return.

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    Display driver to miniport interface (IOCTL interface).
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    1) Miniport IOCTL routine.

    The design attemps to optimize DMA transfer from a fixed piece of virtual
    memory. These IOCTLs are to be defined by the miniport and the following
    descriptions of the IOCTLs are only suggestions.

    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_INIT - set by DispDrvr

        Causes VideoPortLockPages() to be called by the miniport where the DMA_FLAGS is
        set to VideoPortDmaInitOnly. This should only be done in graphics dedicated
        contexts, where disk and network IO is secondary to video IO. Driver writers
        must be aware that system performance (e.g. WinBench) can be damaged by leaving
        memory locked.

    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_TRANSFER_KEEP_LOCKED - set by DispDrvr

        The miniport may set up this IOCTL such that VideoPortDoDma() is called with the
        VideoPortKeepPagesLocked DMA_FLAGS argument. This scenario is oriented to graphics
        dedicated applications. It optimizes throughput so that the HwStartDma() routine
        in the miniport is called. In this way, DMA operations are optimized such that
        memory resources to other parts of the system are constrained.

        The scatter gather list available to HwStartDma() is valid:
            a) before the routine HwStartDma() returns.
            b) if HwStartDma() returns asynchronously, the list may be valid
            if the system memory manager is not stressed. If the PEVENT
            which is the fourth argument to HwStartDma() is set when the DMA is
            done, it will remain valid until then. If the PEVENT is not set,
            the list may become invalid at random times. This PEVENT must
            be set by :
                VideoPortSetEvent(HwDeviceExtension, PEVENT);
            c) if HwStartDma returns synchronously and the system memory
            manager is not stressed, the list will remain valid. if HwStartDma()
            return synchronously and the memory manager is stressed, the list
            will become invalid after HwStartDma returns.


    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_TRANSFER_ONCE - set by DispDrvr

        The miniport may set up this IOCTL so that VideoPortLockPages() is called with
        the VideoPortUnlockAfterDma DMA_FLAGS. This allows the buffer to be locked down,
        the HwStartDma miniport routine to be called back and the memory to be unlocked
        after the dma transfer has completed. This IOCTL is tuned for systems in which
        disk and network IO is very important and memory may be at a premium.

        The same remarks apply to the scatter gather list as for
        IOCTL_VIDEO_TRANSFER_KEEP_LOCKED.


    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_UNLOCK_PAGES - set by DispDrvr

        The miniport should simply call VideoPortUnlockPages() with the appropriate
        PDMA.


    Locking memory

    The video port must lock down the memory in order to perform dma. The
    amount of memory locked down is restricted by three things:
        1) Maximal number of physical page breaks supported by the driver.
        This is strictly a function of the dma hardware.
        2) The number of map registers the system has available at
        initialization. This is usually not bounded for busmaster devices,
        except by that indicated by HalGetAdapter().
        3) System performance contraints. In order to provide reasonable
        throughput for other parts of the system, the amount of memory the
        video port allows to be locked down is currently set as follows:
            a) small systems (12-16 meg)  256k
            b) medium systems (16-31 meg) 512k
            c) large systems (>32 meg)    1M

        These default values can be overridden by setting MaxDmaSize value under the
        Devicexxx key in the CurrentControlSet in the registry. Again, drivers which
        leave more than these amounts of memory locked down can severely impact system
        performance.

    Examples:

    from a miniport StartIo routine (note that the display driver formatting
    is unique to the display driver):

    case IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_INIT:
       {
           //
           // This IOCTL should only be used for buffers that may remained locked
           // down for more than one dma transfer.
           //
           //
           // Map display driver representation into video port. Display
           // driver input buffer is of form
           //
           //   typedef struct _DMA_CONTROL
           //   {
           //           void          * pBitmap;        // Pointer to memory
           //                                           // to be locked.

        return;
    }


    The requirements for these interfaces include:

    1) In the PVIDEO_HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA, the following fields need to be filled:

        PVIDEO_HW_START_DMA  HwStartDma - a pointer to a function which can be
            called when page locking is complete. This function returns
            Dma_Async_Return if it returns before the transfer is complete or
            Dma_Sync_Return if it returns after the transfer is complete.
            These return values are typedefed in video.h. This function takes
            as arguments:
                a)  pHwDeviceExtension - a pointer to a miniport device
                    extension.
                b)  a dma handle returned from a IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_INIT  or
                    IOCTL_VIDEO_DMA_TRANSFER call.
                c)  a PEVENT which is the user Event mapped into kernel mode.
                    (NULL if pMappedUserEvent is NULL).
                d)  pDisplayEvent - a PEVENT, intended to be created and
                    waited on by the DisplayDriver and set by the miniport.
                e)  another PEVENT which must be set if the routine returns
                    Dma_Async_Return when the DMA completes. Failure to set
                    this PEVENT may invalidate the scatter gather lists at
                    any time. It must be set by:

                    VideoPortSetEvent(HwDeviceExtension, pVPEvent);

            Also, HwDeviceExtension should make a copy of the elements of the
            irp it intends to use or pass on, as the irp will be completed when
            HwStartDma returns, and hence it's fields will be invalidated.


    2) In the PORT_CONFIG_INFO, the following fields need to be
       filled:

        ULONG           DmaChannel - a value indicating if the device supports
            DMA.

        ULONG           DmaPort    - a value indicating if the device supports
            microchannel DMA.

        ULONG           NumberOfPhysicalBreaks    - a value indicating the
            maximal number of physical breaks the device supports.

        DMA_WIDTH       DmaWidth   - a value indicating the width of the dma
            device.

        DMA_SPEED       DmaSpeed   - a value indicating the specified transfer
            speed.

        BOOLEAN         DemandMode - a BOOLEAN indicating that the device can
            be programmed for demand mode rather than single cycle operations.

        BOOLEAN         bMapBuffers- a BOOLEAN indicating if an adapter
            requires that the data buffers be mapped into virtual address space.

        BOOLEAN         NeedPhysicalAddresses - a BOOLEAN indicating that the
            driver will need to translate virtual to physical addresses.

        BOOLEAN         ScatterGather - a BOOLEAN indicating that the
            driver will support scatter gather.

        BOOLEAN         Master        - a BOOLEAN indicating that the adapter
            is a bus master. Again, currently required to be TRUE.

        ULONG           MaximumScatterGatherChunkSize - the largest contiguous
            piece of memory the dma controller can handle. This value is zero
            if and only if the size is unbounded.

Notes on Bitblt
===============

    General purpose ROP compiler
    ----------------------------

    Given a ternary ROP is there anyway to know if it needs a pattern?

    Does it needs a source?  How many times does it use the destination?

    Think of a polynomial that can express all possible ROP operations:


      1)  a  + a D + a S + a P + a  SD + a  DP + a  SP + a   DSP
           0    d     s     p     sd      dp      sp      dsp


    Also note that a is from the set of binary digits {0, 1}

    A ROP is currently expressed by taking a bit pattern for the Pattern,

    Source and Destination and applying the bitwise operations (and, or,

    xor, not) to the values.  All math is done modulo 256.


      2)  P = 240 (11110000), S = 204 (11001100), D = 170 (10101010)


    An example ROP for taking the bitwise or of the Source and Pattern,

    anding it with the destination and taking the bitwise not would be:

        ~((P | S) & D)
        ~((240 | 204) & 170)        ~((11110000 | 11001100) & 10101010)
        ~(252 & 170)                ~(11111100 & 10101010)
        ~168                        ~10101000
        87                           01010111

    The ROP would therefore be 87.  Now we have to map the bits in the

    ROP to the terms of the polynomial.  Think of the bits in the ROP

    as a vector.  The a terms in the polynomial as another vector.  A

    matrix can be found to map one vector to the other.


      3) [    ]     [                 ]     [      ]
           b          1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0         a

           b          1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0         a
            3    X                       =     p
           b          1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0         a
            4                                  ds
           b          1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0         a
            5                                  dp
           b          1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0         a
            6                                  sp
           b          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1         a
         [  7 ]     [                 ]     [  dsp ]


    From this formulas for the dependency of bits in the ROP can be found

    for the terms of the polynomial.


      4)  a  = b
           0    0

          a  = b  + b
           d    0    1

          a  = b  + b
           s    0    2

          a  = b  + b
           p    0    4

          a  = b  + b  + b  + b
           ds   0    1    2    3

          a  = b  + b  + b  + b
           dp   0    1    4    5

          a  = b  + b  + b  + b
           sp   0    2    4    6

          a  = b  + b  + b  + b  + b  + b  + b  + b
           dsp  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7


    Dependency on a term can be tested with a parity test, if an odd

    number of the bits are true, the term needs to be evaluated.  For

    example, any odd ROP will have to have the a  term evaluated.  The
                                                0
    operations for each of terms is as follows:


       5) a           ~
           0

          a           ^ DST
           d

          a           ^ SRC
           s

          a           ^ PAT
           p

          a           ^ (DST & SRC)
           ds

          a           ^ (DST & PAT)
           dp

          a           ^ (SRC & PAT)
           sp

          a           ^ (DST & SRC & PAT)
           dsp


    Take for example the ROP 87 (01010111) the expression for it would be:

        ~0 ^ (DST & SRC) ^ (DST & PAT) ^ (DST & SRC & PAT)

    Some other common ROP codes:

    ROP       RPN     Compiled

     00       0       0
     0F       Pn     ~0 ^ PAT
     11       DSon   ~0 ^ DST ^ SRC ^ (DST & SRC)
     33       Sn     ~0 ^ SRC
     44       SDna    0 ^ SRC ^ (DST & SRC)
     66       DSx     0 ^ SRC ^ DST
     88       DSa     0 ^ (SRC & DST)
     AA       D       0 ^ DST
     BB       DSno   ~0 ^ SRC ^ (DST & SRC)
     C0       PSa     0 ^ (SRC & PAT)
     CC       S       0 ^ SRC
     EE       DSo     0 ^ SRC ^ DST ^ (DST & SRC)
     F0       P       0 ^ PAT
     FB       DPSnoo ~0 ^ SRC ^ (DST & SRC) ^ (SRC & PAT) ^ (DST & SRC & PAT)
     FF       1      ~0

    Some simple constant folding can be done to eliminate the 0 from most of
    these expressions, since 0 ^ N always gives N.

More details on DPC handling. More details on suspend handling. 7/24/00 Mike Maciesowicz Added Allocate / Free of watchdog objects. Dropped Initialize (embedded in Allocate). Dropped thread argument from Start / Enter (current thread always assumed). 7/23/00 Mike Maciesowicz Initial revision. 7/21/00 Mike Maciesowicz Part 1 Introduction We had a need to monitor third party display drivers, which sometimes have a tendency of getting stuck spinning in tight loops waiting for the hardware to become idle. If for any reason (hardware bug or hardware programmed incorrectly by the driver) video chip stays in "busy" condition for ever then to the end users it looks like NT itself hangs - they have no clue this is the third party video display driver spinning, and of course, they blame it on NT. We wanted to trap this condition and blue screen the machine indicating that this is a third party display driver causing a system failure, asking user to get updated drivers from video IHV. We created a stand alone DLL which exports watchdog services, we instrumented GDI to monitor the time spent by the thread inside display driver, and we blue screen the machine if this time exceeds 15 seconds (timeout is measured on per-thread bases). We are exporting two sets of watchdog services: watchdog services, which require less initial setup, are well suited for monitoring sections of the code which are called relatively infrequently; deferred watchdog services are very suitable for sections of code called extremely frequently   they require a bit of initial setup, but they are very fast (in case of GDI a performance hit on business graphics benchmark is not measurable - it is within error margin of the test). Watchdog services can be used by kernel components to monitor any potentially spinning code running at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL. Part 2 Watchdog Files Location Header file watchdog.h: %sdxroot%\public\internal\drivers\inc Library files watchdog.lib: %sdxroot%\public\internal\drivers\lib\* Watchdog source code: %sdxroot%\drivers\watchdog Sample usage of deferred watchdog: %sdxroot%\windows\core\ntgdi\gre Part 3 Watchdog Services Interface Two sets of watchdog services are implemented: watchdog services and deferred watchdog services. 3.1 Watchdog Services Interface Watchdog services are well suited for monitoring sections of the code, which are called relatively infrequently. They require less initial setup but they are relatively slow. Summary of watchdog services: WdAllocateWatchdog WdFreeWatchdog WdResetWatch WdResumeWatch WdStartWatch WdStopWatch WdSuspendWatch WdAllocateWatchdog PWATCHDOG WdAllocateWatchdog( IN WATCHDOG_TYPE watchdogType, IN ULONG Tag WdAllocateWatchdog allocates and initializes a watchdog object. Parameters watchdogType Specifies a type time to be monitored by the watchdog. Valid values are: KernelWatchdog, UserWatchdog, and FullWatchdog. Specifies a string, delimited by single quote marks, with up to four characters. The string is usually specified in reversed order. The tag string identifies allocated pool owner. Return Value Pointer to allocated and initialized watchdog object. NULL if the watchdog object cannot be allocated. Include watchdog.h Comments Watchdog objects should be created on per-thread bases, since they measure timeouts in per-thread time. Swapping threads in nested call to WdStartWatch for the same watchdog object will cause checked version of watchdog.sys to assert. Callers of WdAllocateWatchdog must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. WdFreeWatchdog WdFreeWatchdog(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch     ); WdFreeWatchdog frees a block of memory allocated for watchdog object with WdAllocateWatchdog. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. Include watchdog.h Comments Callers of WdFreeWatchdog must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. WdResetWatch WdResetWatch(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch     ); WdResetWatch resets a started watchdog, i.e. it restarts remaining time to expire to the initial value. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. Include watchdog.h Comments Callers of WdResetWatch must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. WdResumeWatch WdResumeWatch(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch,     IN BOOLEAN bIncremental     ); WdResumeWatch resumes previously suspended watchdog. If the watchdog is not currently suspended, then no operation is performed. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. bIncremental If TRUE the watchdog will be resumed only when WdResumeWatch is called the same number of times that WdSuspendWatch was called for given watchdog object. If FALSE watchdog is resumed immediately and its suspend counter is forced to 0. Include watchdog.h Comments Watchdog remains suspended until it is explicitly resumed with a call to WdResumeWatch. Calls to WdStartWatch, WdStopWatch, WdResetWatch have no effect on suspended status. A checked version of watchdog.sys will send a warning message to a kernel debugger if WdStartWatch, or WdStopWatch is executed for a suspended watchdog object. Nested calls to WdResumeWatch are allowed. Callers of WdResumeWatch must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. WdStartWatch WdStartWatch(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch,     IN LARGE_INTEGER liDueTime,     IN PKDPC pDpc     ); WdStartWatch sets a watchdog to expire at a specified time. If the watchdog expires before it is cancelled with WdStopWatch the DPC object pointed by pDpc will be inserted into a DPC queue. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. liDueTime Specifies a relative time at which the watchdog is to expire. The expiration time is expressed in system time units (100-nanosecond intervals). Pointer to a DPC object that was initialized by KeInitializeDpc. If the watchdog expires before it is cancelled with WdStopWatch the DPC object pointed by pDpc will be inserted into a DPC queue. Include watchdog.h Comments Nested calls to WdStartWatch are allowed. Timeout indicated by liDueTime is measured on per-thread bases for the current thread. Watchdog objects should be created on per-thread bases, since they measure timeouts in per-thread time. Swapping threads in nested call to WdStartWatch for the same watchdog object will cause checked version of watchdog.sys to assert. Only one instance of given DPC object can exist in a DPC queue at the time, thus it may be required to use multiple DPC objects for multiple watchdog objects and / or nested calls to WdStartWatch. WdStopWatch will de-queue a client DPC object if it has been already inserted into a DPC queue but it has not been delivered yet (the last call in case of nesting). Swapping DPC objects for a given watchdog object is not allowed without stopping the watch. The checked version of watchdog.sys will assert in case of nested call to WdStartWatch with a pointer to a different client DPC object than the one used in previous call for the same watchdog object. If there is a need to use different DPC objects with nested calls to WdStartWatch then multiple watchdog objects must be used. Callers of WdStartWatch must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. WdStopWatch WdStopWatch(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch,     IN BOOLEAN bIncremental     ); WdStopWatch cancels a watchdog that was previously set to expire at a specified time. If the watchdog is not currently started, then no operation is performed. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. bIncremental If TRUE the watchdog will be cancelled only when WdStopWatch is called the same number of times that WdStartWatch was called for given watchdog object. If FALSE watchdog is cancelled immediately and its start counter is forced to 0. Include watchdog.h Comments If a client DPC object has been inserted into a DPC queue and has not been delivered yet then WdStopWatch will remove it (the last call in case of nesting). Nested calls to WdStopWatch are allowed. Callers of WdStopWatch must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. WdSuspendWatch WdSuspendWatch(     IN PWATCHDOG pWatch     ); WdSuspendWatch suspends a watchdog. Parameters pWatch Pointer to a watchdog object that was allocated with WdAllocateWatchdog. Include watchdog.h Comments Watchdog remains suspended until it is explicitly resumed with a call to WdResumeWatch. Calls to WdStartWatch, WdStopWatch, WdResetWatch have no effect on suspended status. A checked version of watchdog.sys will send a warning message to a kernel debugger if WdStartWatch, or WdStopWatch is executed for a suspended watchdog object. Nested calls to WdSuspendWatch are allowed. Callers of WdSuspendWatch must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. 3.2 Deferred Watchdog Services Interface Deferred watchdog services are very suitable for sections of code called extremely frequently. They require a bit more of initial setup, but they are very fast. Summary of deferred watchdog services: WdAllocateDeferredWatchdog WdEnterMonitoredSection WdExitMonitoredSection WdFreeDeferredWatchdog WdResetDeferredWatch WdResumeDeferredWatch WdStartDeferredWatch WdStopDeferredWatch WdSuspendDeferredWatch WdAllocateDeferredWatchdog PDEFERRED_WATCHDOG WdAllocateDeferredWatchdog( IN WATCHDOG_TYPE watchdogType, IN ULONG Tag WdAllocateDeferredWatchdog allocates and initializes a deferred watchdog object. Parameters watchdogType Specifies a type time to be monitored by the watchdog. Valid values are: KernelWatchdog, UserWatchdog, and FullWatchdog.

Deferred watchdog objects should be created on per-thread bases, since they measure timeouts in per-thread time. Swapping threads in nested call to WdEnterMonitoredSection for the same deferred watchdog object will cause checked version of watchdog.sys to assert. Callers of WdEnterMonitoredSection must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

WDM Audio Sample Code Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains several samples of WDM audio drivers and miniports.
Each of these is contained within a subdirectory as indicated below:

STDUNK:

This directory contains source code for basic standard unknown support that
linked into the other WDM audio samples.  This facilitates the use of COM-like
constructs in the WDM audio drivers.

UART:

This directory contains source for a WDM audio miniport to driver a UART type
device.  This sample shows some of the basics of how one might go about constructing
WDM audio miniport.  Note that this miniport sample is only a piece of a complete
driver and simply compiles to a library that may be linked with additional code
to form a complete driver.

FMSYNTH:

The fmsynth directory contains source code for a miniport for FM synthesizer
devices.  This sample shows some of the miniport basics and, as with the UART
miniport sample, can serve as a starting point for customization if the system
supplied miniports for UART and FMSYNTH do not meet your needs.  This miniport
is not a complete driver and the library built from this sample needs to be linked
with additional code to form a complete driver.

MPU401:

The mpu401 directory contains sample code for a 'stand-alone' MPU401 driver.
This driver, when combined with either the system supplied UART miniport or the
UART miniport sample from this DDK, forms a complete MPU401 WDM audio driver.
The driver is currently setup to link with the DDK UART miniport sample driver.
Simple changes can be made to the 'sources' file within the mpu401 directory to
enable the driver to utilize the system supplied UART miniport.

SB16:

This directory contains a complete WDM audio sample driver for SB16 type devices.
The driver shows examples of how to utilize several miniport drivers to form a
complete driver solution that includes wave audio, mixer topology support, et cetera.
The driver can be installed using the INF provided in the SB16 directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build Notes:

Several of the sample drivers rely on linking to stdunk.lib.  This lib is
generated from the code within the stdunk subdirectory.  So, at least initially,
it is probably best to build from the ntddk\src\audio directory to ensure that
all of the samples and libs are built and are current.

Install Notes:

The INF included in the ntddk\src\audio\sb16 directory (mssb16.inf) can 
be used to install the SB16 sample driver after it has been built.  Simply copy the 
INF and the driver binary to a floppy disk.  You can then install from that 
floppy.  Once the driver has been installed successfully with the INF, you 
can simply drop updated driver binaries into \windows\system32\drivers 
on the target machine and reboot to test the new driver (provided that you 
are not also making INF changes).

WDM, the Windows Driver Model, is a robust model for driver implementation that will be supported by both Windows and Windows NT operating systems.  WDM Streaming is a media streaming architecture based on WDM.  This document concerns WDM Streaming drivers that communicate directly with audio adapter hardware. In an effort to broaden the applicability of the model presented in this document, steps have been taken to insure that drivers written to meet this specification can potentially be used in the absence of WDM Streaming.  In spite of this, the specification retains its WDM Streaming orientation. WDM Streaming presents drivers as filters through which media streams pass.  Filters have pins which can be connected together to form systems of filters.  Input pins consume media streams and output pins produce media streams.  In keeping with this model, audio adapters are manifested as filters.  Input pins on these filters consume audio streams and route them to the audio hardware.  Output pins on these filters produce audio streams from data produced by the hardware. In order to make audio hardware drivers easier to write, the audio driver model isolates hardware interface issues from WDM Streaming filter implementation issues.  It accomplishes this by organizing the driver code into components that address these issues separately and by precisely defining the interfaces between these components.  All the components are referred to as  drivers , although not all are recognized as such by the operating system: Miniport Driver  A miniport driver implements a function-specific interface for a specific function on a specific adapter (audio card).  For example, a particular miniport might implement a MIDI streaming interface for an FM synthesizer on a particular audio adapter.  Miniport drivers are actually part of an adapter driver, and are not recognized as drivers by the operating system. Adapter Driver  An adapter driver is essentially a container for all the miniports drivers associated with a given adapter.  It is recognized as a driver by the operating system, and is contained in its own .SYS file.  Adapter drivers consist of a set of miniport drivers and some additional code that addresses initialization issues. Port Driver  A port driver implements a WDM Streaming filter on behalf of a miniport.  It is responsible for the adapter-independent code that allows a miniport s function-specific interface to be exposed to the system as a WDM Streaming filter.  Port drivers operate in the context of the port class driver. Port Class Driver  The port class driver is essentially a container for a set of port drivers.  At the request of the adapter driver, it binds together port drivers, miniport drivers and hardware resources to form complete subdevices.  It coordinates the operation of these subdevices to form a complete device corresponding to the audio adapter hardware.  It also provides a set of helper functions to adapter drivers and miniport drivers.  Although it exists as a .SYS file, it is not loaded like a driver.  Instead, it is loaded by the system because the adapter driver imports functions that the port class driver exports. Audio miniport drivers control physical audio devices, providing a hardware-specific implementation of function-specific interfaces.  Each audio miniport driver interface specified in this document addresses a particular type of function on an audio adapter.  Typically, any given adapter will support multiple functions.  The adapter driver for a particular audio adapter will therefore expose multiple miniport interfaces.  In many cases, a given driver will expose more than one instance of a particular interface. The following figure illustrates the relationships between these components:  EMBED Word.Picture.8   This layered approach allows for the support of physical devices with a minimum of software development effort.  A hardware manufacturer that wants WDM Streaming support for a sound card goes through the following steps for each function the card supports: Determine if the function is hardware-compatible with hardware for which a miniport driver already exists.  If so, use the existing miniport driver to support the function.  If no such compatible hardware is found Determine if the function is sufficiently similar to functions supported by existing port drivers.  If so, write a miniport driver to support that function, complying with the miniport interface specification associated with the identified port driver.  If no such port driver is found Write a minidriver to support the function, complying with the interface specifications for the streaming class driver. The focus of this document is on miniport driver interfaces and the development of adapter drivers.  This document does not address in detail the manner in which audio adapter functionality will be exposed in the form of WDM Streaming filters and pins. This document includes drivers for all audio hardware whose registers are directly accessible to the system processor.  This includes all ISA/DMA, PCMCIA and PCI adapters.  Specifically excluded from the scope of this document are devices on external busses such as SCSI, USB and 1394.  In addition, this specification is not intended to address software emulation of audio devices.  Emulation should be accomplished at the WDM Streaming filter level. Driver Classification:  Audio Miniports in Perspective In some ways, the configuration of audio driver components described above is peculiar when viewed in the context of  classic  NT drivers.  Terms such as  miniport  and  class  have been borrowed from the NT driver nomenclature without necessarily being faithful to the models they represent. There are five  classic  terms of interest here: Miniport Driver  Traditionally, a miniport driver is a hardware-specific driver for an adapter that resides on a system bus (e. g, PCI or ISA).  A miniport has a single entry point, namely DriverEntry, and registers a table of functions with a port driver.  This table of functions serves as the upper-edge interface of the miniport.  A miniport is completely surrounded by a port driver in the sense that all calls to the miniport are made from the port driver and all calls out of the minidriver are to the port driver lower-edge interface.  Because of this, miniports a platform independent. Port Driver  A port driver surrounds a miniport, handling all system interface issues.  It handles requests from the system which is recasts as calls into the miniport s function table.  It provides a library of support functions (the port s lower-edge interface) to the miniport. Minidriver  A minidriver represents a piece of hardware on a bus.  It binds together the bus driver and one or more class drivers.  It uses the bus driver to communicate to the physical device over the bus, and the class drivers help the minidriver present the physical device to clients as a type of logical device.  In the NT and WDM environments, a minidriver typically receives requests in IRP form from class drivers and sends requests in IRP form to a bus driver.  An example of a minidriver that might bind to multiple class drivers is a minidriver for a CD-ROM drive on a 1394 bus.  The minidriver might bind to a file system class driver so the drive can be accessed as a file system and a Redbook audio class driver so that audio can be streamed from CDs. Bus Driver  A bus driver provides minidrivers with access to a physical bus.  The NT HAL is sometimes referred to as the  system bus driver , meaning that it provides minidrivers with access to the system bus. Class Driver  A class driver implements behavior expected of a class of devices.  This eliminates the need for the duplication of functionality in hardware-specific drivers.  Class drivers are not bus-specific in any way, and so are not aware of resource issues (such as DMA and interrupts). The audio miniports described here are similar to classic miniports with some exceptions.  Because multiple miniports addressing multiple functions can all be linked into a single adapter driver (and associated with a single device object), they do not implement DriverEntry and are not registered in the traditional miniport fashion.  Miniports do not rely entirely on their respective port drivers for support.  The port class driver provides some function-generic support on its lower edge.  Also, audio miniport developers that are willing to be WDM-dependent are free to call WDM functions. The port drivers that support audio miniports fit the classic model fairly well except that they share the device object and are consequently instantiated somewhat differently.  Port drivers also have some characteristics of class drivers in that they implement behavior expected of a class of devices.  Unlike class drivers, they are not bus-independent. The port class driver does not fit the class driver model particularly well.  Its job is to allow multiple port/miniport bindings to share a single device object.  The port class driver is also provides helper functionality to port and miniport drivers. COM in the Kernel Miniport upper edge interfaces consist of function tables.  In traditional miniports, the function table is supplied to the port driver during registration.  Also during registration, the miniport tells the port driver the size of the context structure the miniport will required.  The port driver copies the function table to some private location, allocates the context structure and calls an initialization function in the function table, passing a pointer to the context structure. Audio miniports use a similar approach with the added formalism of COM.  A function table is still used, but it is statically allocated and does not need to be copied by the port driver.  The port driver is also relieved of its context allocation responsibilities.  The miniport code provides a creation function, which allocates the context ( object ) memory from a specified pool and installs a pointer to the function table into the context.  Because the function table pointer is always the first field in the context, the port driver needs only a context pointer and can access the function table through the context. This approach was taken because COM supplies a solid, efficient, widely-understood formalism for creating abstracted objects.  The audio miniport model leverages industry experience with COM and the body of COM literature.  In addition, COM enhances code safety by isolating unsafe casts to a few functions.  Objects can be implemented and used in C or C++.  Assembly can also be used, but this hampers portability. In user mode, COM objects are created using the function CoCreateInstance() or a similar function.  The use of such a function implies that the memory required for the object is allocated in a way that is unknown to the client.  In kernel mode, it is desirable to tightly control the allocation of memory.  Because of this, a different method of object creation is used. The aspects of COM that are used in the audio driver model are the concept of the interface and the definition of the IUnknown interface.  Although there is a mechanism analogous to an in-process server, driver developers don t need to deal with building such servers or accessing the registry.  Miniports are also officially excused from supporting aggregation, although the sample code demonstrates an easy way to support this. By convention, the create function for a particular class of objects always takes the same form: NTSTATUS CreateMyObject     OUT PUNKNOWN *  Unknown,     IN  REFGUID     ClassId,     IN  PUNKNOWN    OuterUnknown  OPTIONAL,     IN  POOL_TYPE   PoolType The first three parameters are identical to the parameters of COM s CoCreateInstance().  A pointer to an IUnknown interface for the object is passed back through Unknown, the class GUID is passed as ClassId (only used if the create function creates objects of multiple classes), and OuterUnknown supplies the unknown interface for the object aggregating the new object (this is generally NULL).  The last parameter specifies the type of pool from which the object is to be allocated. Another convention is to supply a New function for a class, which creates an object, initializes it, and passes back a pointer to the interface that the caller is likely to want.  Because the initialization parameters are class-specific, so is the prototype of the New function. NTSTATUS NewMyObject     OUT PMYINTERFACE *  FavoredInterfacePointer,     IN  PUNKNOWN        OuterUnknown    OPTIONAL,     IN  POOL_TYPE       PoolType, //  more parameters Such functions provide an easy way to instantiate (create and initialize) an object. The sample code eases COM object implementation by providing a class that supports reference counting and aggregation.  The author of an object provides the function required to obtain interfaces on the object.  The helper class (CUnknown) is written in C++.  Objects implemented in C cannot use the helper class. Adapter Driver Construction Driver support for a particular audio adapter takes the form of an adapter driver.  An adapter driver consists of some function-generic code (primarily for initialization) and a set of miniports that address specific functions on the adapter.  The hardware vendor supplies the function-generic code and those miniports that are not supplied by the system. Startup Sequence Because the adapter driver is installed as a kernel mode driver service, the operating system loads the adapter driver and calls its DriverEntry routine.  The DriverEntry routine receives two parameters, both pointers, which it must not use directly.  DriverEntry calls the class driver function InitializeAdapterDriver passing the DriverEntry parameters and a pointer to the adapter driver s add device function (MyAddDevice in this example). NTSTATUS  DriverEntry     IN PVOID Context1,     IN PVOID Context2     return InitializeAdapterDriver(Context1,Context2,MyAddDevice); InitializeAdaptorDriver installs the supplied add device function in the driver object s driver extension, installs the class driver s IRP handlers in the driver object itself, and returns control to DriverEntry.  DriverEntry returns control to the operating system. In the process of enumerating the system busses, the operating system, encounters the adapter device, which is associated with the driver object.  It finds the pointer to MyAddDevice in the driver object s driver extension and calls the function.  Two parameters are supplied, both pointers, which MyAddDevice must not use directly.  MyAddDevice calls the class driver function AddAdapterDevice passing the pointers it received and a pointer to the adapter driver s start device function (MyStartDevice in this example). NTSTATUS  MyAddDevice     IN PVOID Context1,     IN PVOID Context2     return AddAdapterDevice(Context1,Context2,MyStartDevice); AddAdapterDevice creates a functional device object and associates it with the physical device object supplied by the system.  The new functional device object is created with an extension that the class driver uses to store the start device function pointer supplied by MyAddDevice. AddAdapterDevice then returns control to MyAddDevice, which returns control to the operating system. The operating system determines what resources (interrupts, DMA channels and port addresses) will be assigned to the device and requests that the device be started.  The request handler in the class driver calls the adapter driver s start device function, MyStartDevice.  It supplies MyStartDevice with the resource list and two void pointers that that establish context for calls back into the class driver. MyStartDevice separates the resource list into the resources required for each miniport that must be started.  It then starts each miniport and returns control to the class driver, which completes the IRP and returns control to the operating system. Subdevice Creation The term  subdevice  is used to describe the binding of four things: a miniport, a port, a list of resources and a reference string.  The miniport and port are objects that expose the miniport interface and port interface respectively.  The list of resources is a list of those resources that the adapter driver has attributed to the subdevice.  The reference string is a name that is added to the device path name to specify a subdevice during filter creation.   The port class driver is not aware of the distinction between the port driver and the miniport driver.  It wants an object with an interface that will handle the requests generated by the system.  The port driver is such an object.  The port class driver is also unconcerned about resources, wanting only to bind the request handler (the port driver) to a reference string.  It is up to the adapter driver to bind the port, miniport and resources together and then call the port class driver to bind the port driver to the reference string. The following code shows how this might be done:     // Instantiate the port using a function supplied by port class.     PPORT port = NewPort(PortClassId);     if (port)     {         // Create the miniport using its create function.

This class of miniport drivers supports access to DMA-based wave I/O functions of ISA and other audio cards.  The interface addresses cyclic (autoinit) DMA buffers specifically, leaving streaming issues to be solved by the port driver. Scatter/gather wave input and output.  This class of miniport drivers supports access to wave audio functions such as the wave I/O function of a PCI audio card.  In this model, lists of wave audio buffers are logically appended to create a stream of wave audio. Static wave table output.  This class of miniport drivers supports access to wave table synthesizer voices such as the ones supplied by the Creative Labs SoundBlaster AWE32 adapter.  The interface allows for the transfer of static wave data to the adapter and for the manipulation of the voice parameters. Topology.  This class of miniport drivers supports access to the various controls (volume, equalization, hardware reverb) that audio adapters typically offer.  The interface concerns itself with the enumeration of components (known as nodes) in the topology, the discovery of their interconnections and the reading and writing of control parameters. MIDI input and output.  This class of miniport drivers supports access to MIDI-based functions like FM synthesizers and UART-based hardware MIDI interfaces.  Timing is handled by the port driver or some other component higher in the driver stack, allowing the miniport to concentrate on the immediate implementation or delivery of MIDI messages.  MIDI devices, such as MPU-401 coprocessors, which handle their own timing require a specialized port driver are not within the scope of this interface.

Generic Interfaces By definition, the audio miniport interfaces are specific to the functions they are intended to support.  In order to provide some degree of standardization, a generic interface is defined which, while not constituting a complete miniport interface, serves as a base from which other audio miniport interfaces are derived.  The generic miniport interface is called IMiniport.  IMiniport inherits from IPropertyTarget, which exposes support for properties that can be queried and set. Port driver interfaces are standardized only in that they share a common initialization interface.  This interface is known as IPort.  All port drivers expose this interface, and all port driver lower-edge interfaces are derived from it.  Miniports do not call a port driver s initialization function, but it is included in the lower edge to simplify the use and implementation of the port driver. Miniport Generic Interfaces All miniport interfaces supply a property access function.  Some miniport interfaces defined in this document use the property function to manage aspects of the interface that are very complex or are likely to require future enhancements.  Using properties, vendors can extend miniport interfaces without conflicting with new standards or non-standard extensions.  Because WDM Streaming filters and pins expose properties that are much like miniport properties, miniport properties unknown to the port driver can be exposed to WDM Streaming clients.  This means that vendor-specific functionality can be exposed at the WDM Streaming level without the need for custom port drivers. PnP and power management functions are supplied to control the state of the miniport during PnP driver stoppages and power transitions. Miniport Interface Interface IPropertyTarget Inheritance IUnknown Description This interface allows an object to support properties.  A single function allows properties to be queried and set. Functions NTSTATUS Property() ((? PKSIDENTIFIER Property ((? ULONG InstanceSize ((? PVOID Instance ((? ULONG ValueSize ((?

( Out ( Optional ULONG InstanceSize   Size of the instance structure in bytes. ( Out ( Optional PVOID Instance A property-specific structure indicating the instance to which the requested property value applies.  For example, if a property defines the volume associated with a channel in a mixer, the instance information might specify the channel for which volume information is being requested. ( Out ( Optional ULONG ValueSize   The size in bytes of the buffer supplied by the caller to hold the property value.  For property   operations, the size must be at least the size of the property value.  For property   operations, the size must be exactly the size of the property value.  The property function adjusts the value size if it is not exact. ( Out ( Optional PVOID Value   The value of the property or a description of the property in the case of support queries.  TODO:  Explain this some more. ( Out ( Optional Return NTSTATUS STATUS_SUCCESS indicates a successful outcome. Exceptional return values TBD. Miniport Interface Interface IMiniport Inheritance IPropertyTarget Description This is the generic interface supported by all miniports.  By inheriting IPropertyTarget, it supports property access Description This function changes the miniport s stop state. Parameters ULONG StopState   The new stop state to be assumed by the miniport: StopStateNormal  The normal state in which the miniport is not stopped and is not preparing to stop. StopStateQuery  A tentative state used to determine whether the miniport is prepared to stop operation.  The function succeeds if operation can cease without ill effect.  Between a successful transition to this state and the transition to the StopStateStop or StopStateCancel states, the miniport cannot initiate any operation that would compromise its ability to stop. StopStateStop The stopped state.  The miniport should shut down the hardware and free any system resources it has allocated.  The miniport will not be called again without first being initialized. iniport.  When a transition occurs from the normal state to the power down state, the miniport must save the state of the hardware in system memory.  When a transition occurs from the power down state to the normal state, the miniport must restore the state of the hardware. Parameters ULONG PowerState   The power state that the miniport is to change to.  A state value of 0 indicates that the device is to operate normally.  A non-zero value indicates the device must save its hardware state information in pr dapter driver calls the initialization function on this interface.

The interface addresses cyclic buffers specifically, leaving streaming issues to be solved by the port driver.  Multiple channels are supported, each one unidirectional. There are two interfaces that must be supported by the miniport.  The first provides for initialization of the miniport, the enumeration of channels and the creation of streams.  The second interface is the stream interface, which exposes most of the miniport s functionality. Miniport Interfaces The overall miniport interface has three functions:  one for initialization, one to enumerate channels and one to create a stream object.  The stream object interface (not derived from IMiniport) exposes the bulk of the miniport functionality.

For more information regarding the KSDATARANGE structure, consult the WDM Streaming specification.  The Instances field indicates how many instances of the channel may be created.

Port Interface Interface IPortWaveCyclic Inheritance IPort Description This interface is supplied to the miniport for callbacks to the port driver.  Notification is performed in the ISR.  In the shared interrupt case, this may be done by the adapter driver.  Slave and bus master DMA channels may also be instantiated on this interface. Functions void Notify() ((?

Most miniport will call this function in response to a notification interrupt after having cleared the interrupt source.  Although the miniport is free to use other methods to determine when to call this function, precise timing is important and should be maintained. When an ISR is installed, a context parameter (ServiceContext) is submitted along with the address of the ISR.  When the interrupt occurs, the operating system calls the ISR, passing ServiceContext as one of the parameters of the ISR.  It is up to the driver developer to determine what value ServiceContext will contain.  It is recommended, though not required, that the ServiceContext be a pointer to the miniport object.  The context will then allow access to any information required by the ISR.

Static Wave Table Output This class of miniport drivers supports access to wavetable synthesizer voices.  It is intended for devices that provide on-board articulation functions that can be manipulated by system software. The specification of this interface has been temporarily withdrawn.  Subsequent revisions of this document will include this interface. Topology This class of miniport drivers supports access to the various controls (volume, equalization, hardware reverb) that audio adapters typically offer.  It does this by exposing a topology consisting of a set of nodes and their interconnections.  A node can have any number of properties, one of which may be the control value.  Controls are organized in a hierarchy to allow arbitrary subdivision of the control graph.  A top-level control, designated by the identifier 0, contains, directly or indirectly, all other controls in the graph. Nodes that have control values may have any type of value that can be supported by the property mechanism.  Typically, a node will have at most one control value.  For example, a volume node would have a value indicating its current volume setting.  Volume and pan would be exposed as separate nodes. Nodes are connected to one another by entities called connections.  Connections are directed, referring to a from node and a to node.  A connection also specifies a pin number for both of its associated nodes.  Pins are not explicitly supported as entities in the topology, but the pin numbering in the connection entities allows inputs and outputs with distinct functions to be differentiated.  For example, a state variable filter might have three output pins, one each for high, middle and low frequencies.  Pin numbering allows clients of the miniport to determine which connections are associated with which pins. A distinguished node identification is used to represent the topology s external connections.  In the WDM Streaming world, the pins on this  filter node  are the pins on the filter implemented by the topology port driver.  These pins do not allow connection or support data flow, but instead represent physical connections of the adapter hardware.  Some of the filter pins represent connections internal to the system, such as the point at which analog data from a DAC enters the topology.  Other filter pins represent external physical connections, such as the line out jack on an audio adapter. Node pin numbering alone does not allow the client to determine the function of the pins.  Although the miniport identifies the type of a node (by means of a GUID), it offers no description of the node type and no description of the pins supported by the node type.  The specification for how this information is discovered is left to other documents. NOTE:  The set of node types and associated properties is detailed in a document entitled WDM Audio Driver Design Notes and Reference. This miniport interface also supports the delivery of unsolicited control value changes from the miniport to the port driver.  This feature allows for devices that can be physically manipulated by the user.  External changes to node control values are indicated by a notification call to the lower edge of the port driver. The topology miniport interface relies on a descriptor for describing connections between nodes: #define FILTER_NODE ((ULONG)-1) typedef struct ULONG FromNode; ULONG FromNodePin; ULONG ToNode; ULONG ToNodePin; } TOPOLOGY_CONNECTION; This structure is used to describe a connection between two pins in a topology.  A given pin may take part in multiple connections.  Field Description FromNode Identifier of the node which produces information for this connection, or FILTER_NODE if the pin is on the WDM Streaming filter. FromNodePin Identifier of the connected pin on the   node. ToNode Identifier of the node which consumes information for this connection, or FILTER_NODE if the pin is on the WDM Streaming filter. ToNodePin Identifier of the connected pin on the   node.

ISSUES:

Allocator should provide long-message buffers
    Need to update COM interface

SysEx messages
    Unpacker must be rewritten to deal with structured/unstructured.
    Use package bit for SysEx messages!!!
    Need to deal with unstructured format
    Should buffer be freed in Allocator?  
  RESOLUTION
    Yes, it should.  This should be explicit in the spec that a message
    (including the sysex buffer) should not be touched after it is Put().

DPC synchronization between IRP submit/timers/capture PutMsg: shared spinlock.
    We need a shared spinlock, even if we don't do kernel THRU.
    (remember multi-proc can run DPCs concurrently -- even the same one)
    Also, 
        Should we offer built-in timer callbacks on the clock?  
        They could get the spinlock when they register for this callback.
        Or should we wrap the spinlock into the callback itself?
    RESOLUTION
        No, DX8 for the callbacks (external MXFs).

State changes in the graph?
      The IRPs have already been completed successfully, so data can't be flushed.
      Miniport does get alert of state change, though, so it might try to block the data
    RESOLUTION
      Graph never changes state -- clients sets pin directly to RUN upon pin open.
  
    Need to add property on pin to flush sequencer events (and MP events?)

NOT DONE
__________

DONE

Port stuff from PortCls.h and KSMedia.h over to DMusicKS.h

Check in PortCls.h, KSMedia.h, DMusicKS.h changes
Check in INF changes
Check in placefil to add dmus_mpu.sys and .inf to the build
Check in latest dmusic drop

Clock implementation
        running clock versus presentation time and KS clock
        should IRPs have correct presentation time in KS header, or IRefClk time?
    RESOLUTION:
        DMusic.dll will pass a clock to the filter, before the pins are created.  
        They will know to grab the clock from the filter.  The pins will be put 
        in KSSTATE_RUN as soon as they are created, and never stopped.  In this
        way the KS clock imitates an IRefClk.
    No work required on my side

Chains of messages
    Am I handling them correctly?
        Sequencer looks OK
        Miniport (assumes they are in order, probably OK)
        Allocator looks OK
        Packer looks OK

PortCls/SequencerMXF need to use Ks clock specified by user mode client

Pin formats
    Get multiple formats working with render (add KSMUSICFORMAT)
    Limit KSMUSICFORMAT pins to one per miniport (1 each direction)

Capture
        shared buffer scheme?  
    RESOLUTION
        We can do this after regular IRP stuff is working.

Miniports need port method for how far in advance to give msgs (SequencerMXF)

Pin formats
    Get multiple formats working with capture (add KSMUSICFORMAT)

Extensibility of DMUS_K_EVT?  cbStruct alonside cbEvent?
    Would be easy to have 
        WORD    cbStruct
        WORD    cbEvent
        WORD    usChannelGroup
        WORD    fFlags

PAGEREF _Toc490389243 \h  Figure 2 - BDA CA Sample Driver Data Flow  PAGEREF _Toc490389244 \h  Overview  This document describes the BDA conditional access (CA) sample.  The sample is implemented as a sample AVstreaming driver called casamp.sys and a Ring 3 KSProxy Plug-in component called caplugin.ax.  The sample exposes a BDA CA Filter with ICAPolicy and IBDA_ECMMap COM interfaces.  The sample contains basic code that forms a shell that vendors can fill in with their hardware and implementation specific code. The filter contains one BDA control node, an ECM Mapper.  The filter is meant to fit within a BDA receiver filter graph that receives, decrypts and decodes MPEG transport streams defined in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 N0801.  The ECM Mapper s role in such a graph is to monitor particular streams that contain CA information and to decrypt particular streams that contain the video, audio or data for a desired program. Information regarding which streams to monitor for CA information and which streams to decrypt is specified through the IBDA_ECMMap COM interface.  The filter receives the MPEG transport stream containing many particular streams, each particular stream is contained within PES packets all with the same packet identifier (PID).  The filter outputs the particular streams that it decrypted. When the output pin on the filter is connected up the ICAPolicy COM interface implemented in the Plug-in gets aggregated onto the pin.  This interface allows the sample to communicate with the CA manager.  This communication allows the sample to register denials of access with the CA manager if there is a problem decrypting content, for example if the Smart Card has been removed or if the user does not have access to certain channels.  The sample can also display UI to inform the user why a denial has occurred and what can be done to remove the denial. Design Goals  Support a hardware implementation that allows for independent implementation of decryption and CA hardware. Separate hardware specific calls into independent source files so that the sample can easily be used as a starting point for different hardware implementations. Support interfaces that will allow this module to fit into a system processing MPEG transport streams. Justification As digital television evolves there will be many different broadcasters, each with their own market and product array.  These broadcasters will rely on hardware from many different vendors to allow their products to be received on their customers PCs.  Though broadcasters will use standard data multiplexing techniques to transmit data streams, the distribution and identification of the content transmitted and the access control scheme selected may be particular to each broadcaster.  The television application must be able to request content without regard to which access control mechanism is selected to protect premium content.  The BDA Access Control Filter works with a BDA Network Provider to provide this functionality to the broadcast application. Scenarios The Sample BDA CA filter will be loaded and run in filter graphs that include the Sample BDA Network Provider Filter, Sample BDA Tuner/Demodulator Minidriver, Sample BDA Demultiplexor minidriver, and the Microsoft IP Sink Minidriver/Miniport.  The resulting Filter graph will run, but will not actually deliver data. Requirements Network Dependencies None. Hardware Dependencies There are no hardware dependencies for the Sample BDA CA Module to be installed and run in an active filter graph. Software Dependencies DirectDraw Subsystem Microsoft s DirectDraw technologies provide control of video surface allocations within the SVGA device and control of Video Ports (VPE) which provide real-time capture of video data.  On systems that have All-In-Wonder style VGA cards, the control over video capture is managed via DirectDraw.  The Video Capture portions of DirectDraw need to be properly implemented on NT5. DirectShow Subsystem Microsoft s DirectShow technologies use filters that are written by a combination of IHVs, ISVs and Microsoft Corporation.  Our video technologies, tuner, De-multiplex, and CA filters will be connected and controlled by DirectShow.  Some enhancements to the Direct Show facilities may be required. NT-5 Resource Allocation Subsystem Television, network data, and electronic program data services will all be competing for use of the tuner, de-multiplex, and CA hardware.  The BDA system will require a resource management scheme that allows underlying hardware resources to be grouped according to the DirectShow filter graphs in which they appear.  Those groups will then be activated according to a priority scheme that considers the requested priority, whether the graph was already active, and whether the owning application has focus. AVstreaming Subsystem For Ring 0 driver components participating in DirectShow graphs, AVstreaming provides an efficient way to transfer data between driver components.  All data is transferred at Ring 0 using the AVstreaming system.  This technology is key to ensuring the reliable reception of the real-time broadcast streams on a busy Windows platform. NDIS Network Driver Stack All Broadcast IP content must be captured, decoded, and reassembled by the various Broadcast Drivers.  Once IP packets are reassembled they will be delivered to a Microsoft supplied BDA NDIS Miniport.  Successful delivery of data to generic Winsock applications relies on the ability of NDIS to recognize and connect to both unidirectional and bi-directional BDA NDIS Miniports.  In addition, BDA components need to acquire information from the Network Subsystem. This information must be sent to the BDA NDIS Miniport via NDIS OIDs.  Following is a list of new functionality that BDA will require from NDIS. NDIS must recognize whether an interface is SEND ONLY, RECEIVE ONLY, or SEND-RECEIVE.  This information will be provided to the various protocols that may be bound to the interface. NDIS must provide a path for a protocol to send a list of ALL addresses (not just multicast) that will be acquired via a particular interface. NDIS should provide raw IPv4 and IPv6 mediums since most BDA components will deliver IP packets with specific media headers attached. TCP/IP Network Protocol Stack The Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol Stack must be able to connect to unidirectional as well as bi-directional interfaces.  It must be able to automatically assign IP interface address to interfaces that may or may not have an underlying MAC address.  Following is a list of functionality required on the TCP/IP Protocol Stack. Routing must support for SEND ONLY, RECEIVE ONLY, and SEND-RECEIVE interfaces. TCP must send each interface a complete list of all IP addresses that it will acquire through it. KS Proxy Filter Since Ring 0 drivers need to participate in DirectShow filter graphs, the KS Proxy filter is responsible for presenting the driver s interfaces as a filter.  All of our Ring 0 components including the VBI Codecs use KSPROXY to load into filter graphs. Component Descriptions A BDA CA module is implemented as an AVstreaming driver with a corresponding Ring 3 Plug-in DLL.  Most control and data flow functions are handled in the driver.  Interfaces exposed at Ring 3 are exposed via the KSProxy DLL. Any data passed from the BDA CA Filter to a Ring 3 Filter is passed via KSProxy. The Ring 3 Plug-in provides interfaces to the user and to the CA Manager.  It handles CA events (e.g. purchase offers, access denial, and customer UI interaction) that it receives from the driver. BDA CA Driver A BDA CA Module is partially implemented as a AVstreaming driver. BDA CA Driver Control Flow When the CA filter is instantiated within a graph it is the responsibility of other filters to tune and demodulate the MPEG transport stream.  It is also the responsibility of other filters to parse and process the Program Map Table (PMT) to find out what programs are being broadcast and allow the user to select which of these they would like to view.  The program number of the chosen program and the program descriptor corresponding to that program from the PMT must be sent to the CA filter through the plug-in component of this sample via its IBDA_ECMMap COM interface. Each broadcast program is made up of a number of separate streams, called elementary streams (ES).  Each of these ES s contains a particular media content.  There may be an ES for the video of a program, another for the audio of a program in English, another for the audio of a program in Spanish, another for data accompanying a program etc.  Each ES is made up of packets arriving in the MPEG transport stream all having the same PID.  The PMT specifies which ES s make up a particular program.  The application or other filters must decide which ES s need to be decrypted.  The PMT contains descriptors for each ES that specify information such as which stream contains Entitlement Control Messages (ECM s) specifying CA information about that ES.  The PID s of the required ES s and the ES descriptor from the PMT corresponding to the required ES s must be sent to the CA filter through the plug-in component of this sample via its IBDA_ECMMap COM interface. Similar to the PMT there exists a Conditional Access Table (CAT), which contains CA descriptors for the various CA systems being used in the MPEG transport stream.  These CA descriptors specify information needed by the CA systems to decrypt incoming data including the PID of streams that contain only entitlement management messages (EMM s).  These CA descriptors must be sent to the CA filter through the plug-in component of this sample via its IBDA_ECMMap COM interface. Whenever a significant change in the status of the ECM mapper, CA module or SmartCard reader occurs or if the hardware has reason to need to interact with the user (present a message or negotiate a transaction) the CA driver may register one of 4 events (one for each possibility) within the  BdaCAEvent  event set.  This will cause the sample plug-in to query on of 4 corresponding properties within the  BdaCa  property set to retrieve the updated status or desired user interface to display.  For example if the user pulled out the SmartCard from the SmartCard reader the CA filter should realize this has occurred and register the event signaling the status of the SmartCard reader has changed and the sample plug-in would query the CA filter s SmartCard reader status property which would return a value indicating the SmartCard had been removed. The CA driver also exposes required BDA property and method sets.  The network provider uses these interfaces to determine such information as what pins and nodes this filter implements.  The CA sample driver represents a filter with one node, an ECM mapper node.

When connected correctly the filter this driver implements receives the MPEG transport stream on its only data sink pin.  Through the control mechanisms mentioned in the control flow section preceding this, the driver knows which streams contain EMMs, ES content and CA information specific to particular ESs.  It monitors and processes the streams containing EMMs and CA information specific to particular ESs.  Using this CA data it decrypts the particular ESs and sends them out its only data source pin. BDA CA Ring 3 KSProxy Plug-in The interface to the CA Manager and to system resources for presenting UI and clearing transactions is handled by the CA Ring 3 KSProxy Plug-in.  The Ring 3 Plug-in is a DLL that is installed at the same time as the CA driver.  It is loaded and initialized when the CA driver is loaded and connected. The plug-in exists in ring 3 so interfacing with the user can be facilitated by use of message boxes, windows and web-based interaction.  This cannot be done within the ring 0 code that composes the driver.  If the particular CA system needs code to query the user for information, allow the user to make a credit card purchase, inform the user of service changes etc.; the plugin is where that code should reside. BDA CA Ring 3 KSProxy Plug-in Control Flow The CA Module s Ring 3 Plug-in is loaded immediately after the CA driver is loaded.  When it is initialized, the CA Plug-in will register itself with the CA manager.  It first receives a pointer to the CA manager by getting a pointer to the QueryServices interface of the graph it is instantiated within and then using the QueryServices interface to query a pointer to the CA manager.  Using the pointer to the CA manager it gets a pointer to the ICAPolicies interface of the CA manager and requests that an instance of its own ICAPolicy interface be added to the list of policies. The plug-in exposes an IBDA_ECMMap COM interface.  This interface maps directly down to KsSynchronousDeviceControl calls that set and get properties within the ECMMap property set on the driver.  This interface is used to send CA, ES and program descriptors, program numbers and ES content PIDs down to the driver using a COM interface. The plug-in exposes an ICAPolicy COM interface that it can use to interact with the CA manager.  The CA manager will pass down all changes between programs and channels to the ICAPolicy interface so it can check them and verify the user is allowed to view them.   The ICAPolicy and also raise denials of access at any time it sees fit, for example if the BDA CA driver raises an event and indicates that the SmartCard has been removed, the plug-in can register a denial of access with a description indicating the SmartCard must be reinserted to resume viewing. Upon initialization the plug-in creates a thread to watch for events created by the CA sample driver.  These events indicate changes in the status of the ECM mapper, CA module or SmartCard reader or requests by the driver to display some form of user interface.  Upon receipt of these events the plug-in will query for the updated status or desired user interface.  Interface Implementation Since the Sample Conditional Access Filter is implemented as a AVstreaming  driver, the interfaces exposed by the Filter are implemented as AVstreaming driver property, event and method sets.  Calls to the various member methods, event signals and property manipulations are sent as I/O Request Packets (IRP s) and are proxied by AVstreaming.  The Sample Conditional Access KSProxy Plug-in is implemented as a generic DLL that KSProxy loads along with the Filter.  The plug-in exposes two COM interfaces. Interfaces Exposed on CA Sample Driver The following interfaces are exposed on the filter implemented in the CA Sample Driver. Note:  property and event sets meant to be exposed on the ECM Map node have been temporarily moved to the output pin because KSProxy does not yet aggregate them to the output pin but will in the future. BdaEcmMap Property Set (exposed on ECM Map node) Allows for setting of the CA, program and ES descriptors as well as setting which program number is to be viewed and which ES s are to be decrypted.  The plugin exposes an IBDA_ECMMap COM interface which maps directly down to this interface allowing Ring 3 code to control this property set. BdaCA Property Set (exposed on ECM Map node) This property set contains 4 properties allowing for querying of the status of the ECM mapper, CA module or SmartCard reader and an addition property to query for a UI for the plug-in to display.  Each of these 4 properties corresponds to an event within the BdaCAEvent event set; the signaling of one of these events indicates the plug-in should query the corresponding property within this set. BdaCAEvent Event Set (exposed on ECM Map node) This event set contains 4 events corresponding to their respective properties in the BdaCA property set.  The driver signals any of these events to indicate the corresponding property should be queried. BdaTopology Property Set (exposed on filter) This property set is used by BDA to figure out what node types and pin types this filter can provide, how these nodes should be connected together, and the ID of the controlling pin.  These properties map to corresponding function within BdaSupp.cpp which in turn access global variables defining this information within ObjDesc.cpp. BdaChangeSync Method Set (exposed on filter) BDA uses this method set to make sure changes to certain properties happen in a controlled order.  Though the sample has no properties that require such control, functions implementing this architecture have been stubbed out for vendor use. BdaDeviceConfiguration Method Set (exposed on filter) The methods in this method set are used to control the configuration of this filter.  The functions handling these methods are mapped to functions within BdaSupp.cpp with the exception of CreateTopology which has been implemented in a basic manner within the sample filter. Interfaces Exposed on CA Sample Plug-in The following interfaces are exposed on the CA Sample Plug-in. ICAPolicy This interface represents the policy object that gets automatically registered with the CA manager.  This interface is used to communicate denials of access to the CA manager.  This interface should only be instantiated by the plug-in itself when it registers this interface with the CA manager. IBDA_ECMMap This interface can be instantiated by any code that needs to send CA, program or ES descriptors as well as the program number of a program to be viewed or the PID of an ES to be decrypted to the ECM mapper. Data Sink Pins Exposed Following is a list of the Data Sink Pins exposed by the CA sample filter.  Media format definitions for the pins are all found in BdaMedia.h. MPEG Transport Stream Data Sink Pin The CA sample filter exposes one MPEG transport stream data sink pin.  This pin receives the entire transport stream containing packetized streams containing the EMMs, ECMs, and encrypted ES s.  According to the descriptors received through the IBDA_ECMMap interface it should monitor particular streams for all the conditional access data such as keys and other encryption information the ECM mapper needs to decrypt the particular ES s.  One instance of this pin is all that is allowed and is necessary. This pin supports the following media format. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_TYPE_STREAM Specifies that this pin receives a data stream. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_TYPE_MPEG2_TRANSPORT Specifies that the stream is an MPEG-2 packetized transport stream. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_SPECIFIER_BDA_TRANSPORT Specifies that this stream is within a BDA network. Data Source Pins Exposed Following is a list of the Data Source Pins exposed by the CA sample filter.  Media format definitions for the pins are all found in BdaMedia.h. MPEG Transport Stream Data Source Pin The CA sample filter exposes one MPEG transport stream data source pin.  This pin is where the filter will place the decrypted ES s.  One instance of this pin is all that is allowed and is necessary.  This pin is not defined within the initial pin descriptions but is within the pin template array and hence is created by the BDA network provider. This pin supports the following media format. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_TYPE_STREAM Specifies that this pin produces a data stream. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_TYPE_MPEG2_TRANSPORT Specifies that the stream is an MPEG-2 packetized transport stream. STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_SPECIFIER_BDA_TRANSPORT Specifies that this stream is within a BDA network. Installation and Initialization Driver Installation The sample driver and plug-in can be installed using the  Add New Hardware  utility on the Control Panel and by selecting the  Have disk  option and using CASamp.INF included with this sample.  Please note that the driver appears to get installed twice because the INF calls streamci.dll to register parts of the driver and streamci goes ahead and installs the entire driver again.  I am in the process of finding a solution to this problem. Driver Initialization DriverEntry When the operating system loads the driver, the driver s DriverEntry routine is called.  At this point KsInitializeDriver is called with a pointer to the DeviceDescriptor which supplies kernel streaming utilities with the device dispatch table and the filter descriptor.  The device dispatch table contains pointers to functions to Start and Create the device.  The Start function calls BdaCreateFilterFactory to create a filter factory to create instances of the filters implemented in this device, namely the sample CA filter.  The Create function allocates memory for an instance of the CDevice class and makes this the context for the device. Filter Descriptor Usage The DeviceDescriptor passed to KSInitializeDriver contains the filter descriptor.  KSProxy uses the filter descriptor to instantiate instances of any of the filters this driver can produce.  The filter descriptor contains filter, pin, and BDA node descriptors as well as automation tables, dispatch tables, and pin templates.  These items are all contained within the ObjDesc.CPP file.  Kernel streaming, KSProxy and AVstreaming documentation should be referenced for information on how these tables and descriptors are used. Interface Initialization Driver Interface Initialization  Please reference BDA and KSProxy documentation for information about how Source Pins, Sink Pins, method sets, event sets and property sets are initialized by the KSProxy.   Plug-in Interface Initialization  During installation the INF file adds a registry entry under MediaInterfaces containing the GUID of the CA event property set.  This entry also contains the name of the plug-in.  Whenever KSProxy loads and initializes a filter exposing a property set with the same GUID as a GUID in the MediaInterfaces list it responds by loading the named plug-in DLL/AX file in the registry entry and every time any method, event or property set is exposed on a filter it checks to see if the loaded DLL/AX files support COM interfaces with the same GUID as the method, event, or property set being exposed.  When a match is found KSProxy creates an instance of that COM interface.  This is the method by which the CA sample plug-in gets loaded. The DllRegisterServer function within the plug-in gets called when KSProxy loads the plug-in.  The DllRegisterServer function within the CA sample plug-in calls AMovieDllRegisterServer2 which uses the g_Templates global variable within caplugin.cpp to expose the COM classes listed within g_Templates.  This is the method by which the CA sample plug-in exposes its COM class. Required IHV Customization  This CA sample driver and plug-in are meant to be a template for IHVs to use to implement a driver and a plug-in to support their hardware.  Many functions within the source files are just stubbed out and must be filled with additional code in order for them to correctly control hardware.  In a number of places I have written comments containing  TO DO:  reminders with notes about what an IHV needs to implement in order to make a useful driver.  The code that needs to be added is mainly to support the particular hardware implementation an IHV chooses. Driver Customization The modifications necessary to the driver are mainly those needed to relay control messages to the hardware implementation.  For example when a message comes through the ECM mapper interface telling the driver to map a certain ES, it is the responsibility of the driver to command the hardware to do this.  One of the important features of the driver, which has not been implemented in the sample driver, is detection of denials of access.  The driver is responsible for listening for and receiving messages for the hardware to indicate that a particular ES cannot be decrypted.  When such a failure is detected the driver should register a change of status event (BDA_ECM_MAP_STATUS_CHANGED) using KsPinGenerateEvents.  Following the event the plug-in will request the new ECM mapper status from the driver, to which the driver should return a value indicating a decryption failure. Plug-in Customization The modifications necessary to the plug-in are mainly those needed to handle CA manager communications specific to the CA system, such as denying access for different reasons and payment and refunding of tolls.  When the plug-in retrieves a status change from the driver indicating it cannot decrypt an ES that was requested for decryption it is the responsibility of the plug-in to register a denial with the CA manager and attach appropriate tolls.  The sample plug-in includes an currently unused function called RegisterDenial that creates a denial and attaches an instance of the CMyToll class to the denial.  The CMyToll class is a class defined in catoll.h and catoll.cpp that the IHV can customize to contain their specific code to handle payment and refunding of tolls.  The CMyToll class implements a ICAToll COM interface which is required of tolls used with the CA manager.

Readme.txt for BT848


Description:
------------

   BT848 is a sample WDM stream class Capture driver which supports the 
BT848 and BT878 video digitizer chips from Brooktree. It manifests
itself in a DShow graph as two filters, "BT848 Capture", and "BT848 Crossbar".  

   This is a fairly complex driver, in that it supports an input stream 
representing analog video, and three capture streams for video, preview, and 
VBI data.


Installation:
-------------

    Use the file "BT848.inf" to install this device.
                                                       
Testing:
--------               

   1.  WebTV for Windows
   
   - Install a Brooktree BT848 evaluation card.
   - Install WebTV for Windows
      StartMenu.Settings.ControlPanel.Add/Remove Programs.WindowsSetup.
      WebTV for Windows
   - Click the TV icon in the tray, and watch TV
   
      
   2.  GraphEdt.exe
   
   - Make sure you're using a version of DShow 5.2 or better 
      GraphEdt.exe. This is needed to support new PnP features.
   - Graph.InsertFilters
      "WDM Streaming Capture Devices"
         "BT848 Capture"
      "WDM Streaming Crossbar Devices"
         "BT848 Crossbar"
      "WDM Streaming TvTuner Devices"
         "BT848 TvTuner"
   - Connect up the graph by rendering the output pins on the TvTuner
   - Graph.Play
   - Right Click on TvTuner filter to change the TV channel
   - Right Click on Crossbar filter to change the input selection.  
   - Right Click on Capture filter to change capture filter properties
   
   
   3.  AMCap.exe
   
   This capture application is provided in the DShow SDK, and does all of 
   the graph building automatically for both WDM and VFW capture filters.


Other stuff:
------------

   - To test VBI capture operation, use VBIScope.ax.  This DShow filter 
     gives a graphical display of any two selected VBI lines and provides 
     precise timing information.
   
   - This driver is still in progress as of 4/27/98, and should not be considered
     final.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Title _PID_GUIDJohnLee Normal.dot JohnLee Microsoft Word 8.0bjbjt+t+ Purpose: This document describes the name extension feature added to the stream class driver which is shipped latest in windows 2000. Description: The name extension feature allow a stream class mini driver to support as many filter types as name extensions specified. The original stream.sys does not support a mini driver to specify more than one filter types by a single mini driver. The new feature also support multiple instances of a single filter types. Backward compatibility: Existing stream class mini drivers will continue to work as before. However, it is recommended that a new stream class mini driver uses the new feature, i.e. to specify at least one name extension. That is one name,  if it desire to support one filter type. Name extension: The name extension is an array of WCHAR pointers pointing to the names of the filters a mini driver desires to support. Previous version of stream class driver creates an implicit name L GLOBAL  for the filter a mini driver support. A new mini driver can use the string L GLOBAL  as the name extension for its filter. The string bears no special meaning to the stream class driver. However, a mini driver might want to choose more discriminating names such as L Decoder  and L Encoder  if a mini driver is to support a decoder filter and an encoder filter.  A mini driver specifies name extensions in the HW_STREM_INFORMATION structure that it reports to the stream class driver by using the fields NumberOfNameExtenions and NameExtensionArray. (refer to strmini.h for the exact structure information ) Specifying Stream Information: In response to SRB_GET_STREAM_INFO, a mini driver reports information for all filters each with a HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR. In the case a mini driver supports one name extension, i.e. one filter type, it reports one HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR which is the same condition with an old mini driver and previous version of stream class driver. When a mini driver reports the StreamDescriptorSize in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION, the number should account for all HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR which should be arranged in one by one in the order corresponding to the name extensions. There should be exact number of HW_STREAM_INFORMATION as the number of name extensions. New Service in the Stream class driver: VOID STREAMAPI StreamClassFilterReenumerateStreams(  IN PVOID HwInstanceExtension, IN ULONG StreamDescriptorSize A new mini driver should use this function to re-enumerate the streams on a filter instance if it desire to change the streams on the filter instance. At a re-enumeration, it s the mini driver s responsibility to ensure the ordering of connected streams which should not be changed or removed  from the re-enumerated stream set.  The SteamDescriptorSize is the number of bytes needed to contains the new StrreamDescriptor for the filter instance. A new mini driver should not use the other function StreamClassReenumerateStreams() which is retained only for backward compatibility. New STREAM_MINIDRIVER_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION_TYPE The new type SignalMultipleDeviceInstanceEvents is added. It should be used in the function VOID STREAMAPI StreamClassDeviceNotification( IN STREAM_MINIDRIVER_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION_TYPE NotificationType, IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension, IN PVOID HwFilterInstanceExtension,                                               ... where NotificationType is SignalMultipleDeviceInstanceEvents.

For each HID minidriver in the system, the HID class driver keeps a 
HIDCLASS_DRIVER_EXTENSION, like so:

HID.SYS -+--> HIDCLASS_DRIVER_EXTENSION
	 |
	 +--> HIDCLASS_DRIVER_EXTENSION
	 |
	 .
	 .
	 .

For each device object associated with a minidriver, the class 
driver keeps a HIDCLASS_DEVICE_EXTENSION, like so:

HIDCLASS_DRIVER_EXTENSION -+--> HIDCLASS_DEVICE_EXTENSION
			   |
			   +--> HIDCLASS_DEVICE_EXTENSION
			   |
			   .
			   .
			   .

For each collection associated with a device object, the class driver keeps 
a HIDCLASS_COLLECTION structure:

HIDCLASS_DEVICE_EXTENSION -+--> HIDCLASS_COLLECTION
			   |
			   +--> HIDCLASS_COLLECTION
			   |
			   .
			   .
			   .

For each file object associated with a collection, the class 
driver keeps a HIDCLASS_FILE_EXTENSION structure:

HIDCLASS_COLLECTION -+--> HIDCLASS_FILE_EXTENSION
		     |
		     +--> HIDCLASS_FILE_EXTENSION
		     |
		     .
		     .
		     .

Finally, the class driver keeps a list of IRPs that are pending against 
each file object:

HIDCLASS_FILE_EXTENSION -+--> IRP
			 |
			 +--> IRP
			 |

This driver registers with the HID class driver and  responds to IRPs put out by HIDclass. It informs HIDClass  about the capabilities of the joystick and polls the joystick  in response to a read IOCTL.\par  This driver is loaded in reponse to a "New hardware Found"  PnP event, and consequently must have an entry in an inf file  that binds a PnP hardware ID to this driver.\par  Gameport joysticks are not true PnP devices, so the user has to  inform the system about the joystick that was added to the  gameport by using the Game Controllers CPL "Add" a joystick.  An example of how a new joystick type can be created is provided  in the accompanying inf file.\par  Once a user selects a joystick and gameport, the GameCPL passes  this information to DirectInput which sends an IOCTL to the  gameport bus driver (GameEnum), specifying the number of axes,  buttons and a PnPHardware ID for the joystick. The Gameport Bus  informs PnP of a new device arrival. PnP searches the system for  a match for the hardwareID and loads the appropriate driver.\par  The following files are part of this driver.\par  \line HidGame.c  \line DriverEntry, CreateClose, AddDevice and Unload Routines.  This code performs functions required for any device driver  and so can probably be used without changes for any game  other game device.\par  \line PnP.c  \line Support routines for PnP IOCTLs.\par  \line Ioctl.c  \line Support routines for Non PnP IOCTLs  These deal with all the HID IOCTLs required for an ordinary  game device and so could be used without change as there is  no analog specific funtionality in these routines.  Drivers for some devices may need to add code to support more  complex devices.\par  \line HidJoy.c  \line Support routines to translate legacy joystick flags and  data into HID descriptors.  The majority of this code is  needed to support the wide variety of analog joysticks  available so is not relevant to drivers written for specific  devices.\par  \line Poll.c  \line Support routines to read analog joystick data from a  gameport.  These functions are likely to be of little use  in a digital joystick driver.\par  \line i386\\timing.c  \line Support routines to use x86 Time Stamp Counter.  Includes code to check for the presence of, calibrate and  read the high speed CPU timer.\par  \line Hidgame.h  \line Common include file.  The general definitions are likely to be of use in most  drivers for game devices but some customization will be needed.\par  \line Debug.h  \line Definitions to aid debugging.  This contains the tag for the driver name used in debug output  which must be changed.\par  \line Analog.h  \line Specific include file.  Definitions specific to analog joystick devices.\par  \line OemSetup.inf  \line Sample inf file.

The position  information in analog devices is conveyed by the  duration of a pulse width. Each axis occupies one bit position.  The read operation is started by writing a value to the joystick  io address. Immediately thereafter we begin examing the values  returned and the elapsed time.\par  This sort of device has a few limitations:\par  First, button information is not latched by the device, so if a  button press which occurrs in between polls it will be lost.  There is really no way to prevent this short of devoting  the entire cpu to polling.  In reality this does not cause a problem.\par  Second, since it is necessary to measure the duration of the axis pulse,  the most accurate results would be obtained using the smallest possible  sense loop and no interruptions of this loop.  The typical range of pulse lengths is from around 10 uSecs to 1500 uSecs  but depending on the joystick and gameport, this could extend to at least  8000 uSecs.  Keeping interrupts disabled for this length of time causes  many problems, like modems losing connections to sound break ups.\par  Third, because each iteration of the poll loop requires an port read, the  speed of the loop is largely constrained by the speed of the IO bus.  This also means that when there is contention for the IO bus, the loop  will be slowed down.  IO contention is usually caused by DMAs (or FDMAs)  which result in a significant slow down.\par  Forth, because of the previous two problems, the poll loop may be slowed  down or interrupted at any time so an external time source is needed to  measure the pulse width for each axis.  The only cross-platform high  resolution timer is the read with KeQueryPerformanceCounter.  Unfortunately the implementation of this often uses a 1.18MHz 8253 timer  which requires 3 IO accesses to read, compounding the third problem and  even then, the result may need to be reread if the counters were in the  wrong state.  Current CPUs have on board counters that can be used to  provide very accurate timing and more recent HAL implementations tend to  use these to implement KeQueryPerformanceCounter so this will be a problem  on less systems as time goes on.  In the majority of cases, a poor  KeQueryPerformanceCounter implementation is made irrelevant by testing  for the availability of a CPU time stamp counter on Intel architechtures  and using it directly if it is available.\par  The algorithm implemented here is not the most obvious but works as  follows:\par  Once started, the axes read a value of one until the completion of their  pulse.  The axes are the four lower bits in the byte read from the port.  The state of the axes in each iteration of the poll loop is therefore  represented as a value between 0 and 15.  The important time for each  axis is the time at which it changes from 1 to 0.  This is done by using  the value representing the state of the axes to index an array into which  time values are stored.  For each axis, the duration of its pulse width is  the latest time stored in the array at an index with the bit for that axis  set.  However since interrupts can occur at any time, it is not possible  to simultaneously read the port value and record that time in an atomic  operation the in each iteration, the current time is stored in two arrays,  one using the index before the time was recorded and the other using the  index after the time was recorded.  Once all the axes being monitored have become 0, or a timeout value is  reached, the data left in the arrays is analysed to find the best  estimate for the transition time for each axis.  If the times before and  after the transition differ by too much, it is judged that an interrupt  must have occured so the last known good axis value is returned unless  that falls outside the range in which it is known that the transition  occured.\par  This routine cannot be pageable as HID can make reads at dispatch-level.\par  \pard\plain \sa160\sl240 \fs21\lang1033 Defined in: c:/ntddk/src/wdm/hid/hidgame/poll.c\par  \pard\plain \s46\sb20\sl-220\keepn\pvpara\phpg\posy0\absw1560\dxfrtext240\dfrmtxtx240\dfrmtxty240 \b\f2\fs21\lang1033 Parameters\par \pard\plain \s50\sl-240\keepn \f0\fs21\lang1033 {\i DeviceExtension}\par  \pard\plain \s54\li280\sa80\sl-240 \f0\fs21\lang1033 Pointer to the device extension.\par  \pard\plain \s50\sl-240\keepn \f0\fs21\lang1033 {\i resisitiveInputMask}\par  \pard\plain \s54\li280\sa80\sl-240 \f0\fs21\lang1033 Mask that describes the axes lines that are to be polled\par  \pard\plain \s50\sl-240\keepn \f0\fs21\lang1033 {\i fApproximate}\par  \pard\plain \s54\li280\sa80\sl-240 \f0\fs21\lang1033 Boolean value indicating if it is OK to approximate some  value of the current axis state with the last axis state  if polling was not successful (we took an interrput during polling)\par  \pard\plain \s50\sl-240\keepn \f0\fs21\lang1033 {\i Axis[MAX_AXES]}\par  \pard\plain \s54\li280\sa80\sl-240 \f0\fs21\lang1033 The state of the axes.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. Microsoft USB Point-of-Sale Title _PID_HLINKSMicrosoft USB Point-of-Sale ervinp Normal ervinp Microsoft Word 9.0VG~\&bjbjU Microsoft USB Point-of-Sale Ervin Peretz, Karan Mehra Microsoft Corporation July 1999 Background The current mainstay of the point-of-sale industry is serial and parallel devices, mostly serial. There has been a lot of work done towards a dichotomous control-object / service-object architecture, where the service object drives and abstracts a particular vendor's device so that a control object can talk to any device of a given class (e.g. scale, barcode scanner, coin dispenser, line display, POS printer, the list goes on). There are hundreds of existing service objects for serial devices. Microsoft has been working with the USB Device Working Group to standardize a set of HID (Human Input Device) usages that, once in place, would abstract all point-of-sale devices at the application level. However, it is apparent that a workable specification of HID usages for POS and a verifiable supporting driver are years away. So while Microsoft is interested in HID for Point-of-Sale in the long term, the immediate goal is to enable the USB point-of-sale industry in a way that is compatible with existing service objects.   POSUSB Driver In order to enable USB point-of-sale devices under the existing software architecture, Microsoft is providing the POSUSB driver to expose USB point-of-sale interfaces as serial COM ports to service object DLLs. For vendors building USB versions of existing serial devices, which accept similar command syntax as the serial version, the port of the service object to support the new USB device should require minimal effort. Hardware Requirements In order for POSUSB to drive your USB point-of-sale device, the device must first be compliant with the USB 1.1 specification, available at   HYPERLINK "http://www.usb.org"  http://www.usb.org . Use this document to educate yourself on USB hardware and firmware basics such as configurations, interfaces, endpoints, and the corresponding descriptors. The POS functionality must be exposed on the default configuration of your device. The default configuration must expose a single vendor-class interface; i.e. the bInterfaceClass field of the interface descriptor must be 0xFF. That interface should have a pair of endpoints (one IN endpoint and one OUT endpoint) for each serial interface you want POSUSB to expose.  All these endpoints need to be of either type BULK or INTERRUPT. POSUSB will walk the first vendor-class interface in the default configuration of your device.  It will find the first IN and the first OUT endpoints of the right type and expose them as a serial interface; the second IN and second OUT endpoints of the right type will be exposed as the second serial interface, etc. Download and Installation Instructions Follow these instructions to install the USB Point-of-Sale: Go to   HYPERLINK "http://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/developers/initiatives/opos/home.stm"  http://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/developers/initiatives/opos/home.stm Download and run the self-extracting executable file usbpos.exe. Copy the extracted files (posusb.sys and ptofsale.inf) onto a blank floppy. If you are testing a new device, edit ptofsale.inf and fill out the parts marked  <VENDOR SECTION>  with the hardware PnP id and other information for your device as described therein.   Now plug your device into a test machine. Follow the instructions on the screen and insert the floppy when requested. When setup completes, check the Device Manager for your device. Run regedit and look for the COM port name allocated for your device under the HKLM\Hardware\DeviceMap\SerialComm key. Future releases of POSUSB are slated to include Control Panel support for Point-of-Sale that will expose this information better. Now configure your service object to use this provided COM port. Future releases will specify an automatic way for service objects to find the COM ports allocated for them. Odd Endpoint Feature Some simple POS devices do not require bi-directional communication, and so, have only a single endpoint. POSUSB has support for such devices. The driver is notified of this feature during installation, via the Setup Information File, ptofsale.inf, in which the vendor needs to set the OddEndpointFlag (a comment in ptofsale.inf explains how to do this).  The Odd Endpoint may be either an IN or an OUT endpoint.  POSUSB tries to map as many pairs of IN/OUT endpoints as are present to serial interfaces.  If an endpoint is left over, it is ignored by default; but when the OddEndpointFlag is turned on, POSUSB exposes this odd endpoint as a unidirectional COM interface. By default this flag is disabled, as we don t recommend building such devices. Status Line Emulation An issue that came up at the March, 1999 OPOS meeting was whether the POSUSB driver would emulate physical serial status lines on the serial interfaces. The purpose of this feature is to support existing service objects that were written for an actual serial device, rather than for a USB device exposed as a virtual serial port.  Since serial status lines are used in device-specific ways by serial POS devices, the serial status emulation feature requires special support on the USB version of the device to report the settings of the status lines for the emulated serial device. The serial status emulation feature was implemented in POSUSB and was tested in simulation. For lack of device support, however, this feature is disabled in the current release, and there is no registry key or other backdoor way to enable it. Nevertheless, the feature is described here for vendors wishing to pursue building such a device and working with Microsoft to get the feature tested and exposed in a future release. See the Hardware Requirements section above for the general requirements of a POSUSB device. The additional requirements/restrictions for a device supporting the serial status emulation feature are as follows: All data endpoints must be of the type BULK. For every pair of IN/OUT data endpoints on the vendor interface, there must be an INTERRUPT IN endpoint associated which the device will use to send serial status signals. These three endpoints will together be mapped to a single emulated COM port. The device can report status signals via the interrupt endpoint that POSUSB will interpret to the service object DLLs. Further, POSUSB can fake signals like baud-rate, parity, bits-per-second, which are of no use to the USB protocol, thus achieving complete emulation of the serial environment. POSUSB can also simulate all the registers on the serial port, filling in RTS, DTR, DCD, RI, DSR, CTS, etc from the status pipe, thus supporting the serial data structures such as DCB, COMMTIMEOUTS and COMMPROP.  Once again, serial status emulation is disabled in the current release. Vendors wishing to build a device with this feature should contact the Microsoft reps below. Static Port Allocation On Win2000, POSUSB reserves a COM port for each interface via the COM name arbiter on initial PnP and records it in the software key. This guarantees a non-conflicting, perennial COM port name for each interface across boots and re-plugs. On Win98, there is no COM name arbiter. POSUSB pokes into the SERIALCOMM key for an available COM port name and records it in the software key. This guarantees a perennial COM port name for the interface, but it does not totally guarantee that other drivers that don t record their COM ports in the SERIALCOMM key will not conflict. Console Apps on Win98 In order to be WDM-compliant, the POSUSB driver does not register its serial COM interface with vcomm.vxd on Win98.  On Win98, a C-runtime-type open from a console app (e.g. 'fopen') on a POSUSB COM interface will succeed the internal CreateFile, but the runtime's GetFileType call on the handle returns FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN. . This is because the runtime checks if the device name is registered with vcomm.vxd, but since in this case it is not, it fails the console-level open. This means that redirect-to-COM will not work on Win98. This does not hinder service objects DLLs, but vendors should be aware that console test apps might not work for POSUSB COM interfaces on Win98. The correct cross-platform way to open a COM interface is using the full legal '\\.\COMx' device name.  Recall that the C compiler treats backslash as an escape character, so the C call from a service object DLL to open COM5 would read: CreateFile ("\\\\.\\COM5",...); Supported Operating Systems  POSUSB requires Windows 98 or Windows 2000. Windows NT4 is not supported because it did not ship with USB support.  Although 3rd party USB drivers for NT4 are available, these drivers have interfaces incompatible with those of Microsoft Windows USB drivers.  POSUSB will not work with these external drivers. Release Vehicles POSUSB for a stand-alone installation on either Windows 98 or Windows 2000 is available for immediate download at:   HYPERLINK "http://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/developers/initiatives/opos/home.stm"  http://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/developers/initiatives/opos/home.stm POSUSB is targeted to ship with Millennium, the release of the Windows 98 code base following Windows 98 Second Edition. POSUSB is targeted to ship with Neptune, the Windows NT code base release following Windows 2000.

If you already have a USB point-of-sale device and it does not meet the specifications in the Hardware Requirements section above, contact us immediately and send us a unit.  We will try to accommodate all existing devices in future POSUSB releases. If you are building a USB point-of-sale device, the best way to ensure smooth operation on Windows is to send us a prototype.  Send a unit and spec to Ervin Peretz c/o Microsoft.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDocTimes New Roman Symbol Arial Arial Times New Roman Symbol Introduction to HID Minidrivers HID minidrivers abstract the bus-specific details from the HID class. The USB Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices, Version 1.0, specification (USB HID; available at http://www.usb.org/developers/index.html) only refers to devices connected by way of a USB bus, and Microsoft provides the HID minidriver for USB (Hidusb.sys) under Windows NT  version 5.0 and Windows  98. Therefore, you do not need write any drivers for HID-compliant devices that are connected using USB. However, by writing a HID minidriver, you can make virtually any external device appear to be a HID device, regardless of the connector it uses.  One advantage to making non-USB devices appear to be HID devices is that it completely isolates the connection details from applications accessing the device. For example, consider a camera that can be remotely controlled by a computer and that comes with either a USB connector or a serial connector to support older computers that don t have USB ports. If you write a HID minidriver that makes the serial camera controls look like HID features, then you can create a single application using Microsoft DirectInput APIs to control either the serial or USB camera without special code to handle the connection differences. This provides a simple mechanism to support devices connected by way of legacy ports while at the same time taking advantage of the newer USB capabilities. Introduction to the HID Minidriver Sample The HID minidriver sample in the DDK has some peculiar features. The sample was designed to demonstrate a simple HID minidriver using a device that is readily available-in this case, a USB keyboard. To load the sample minidriver, it is necessary to trick the system to prevent it from loading the version of the Hidusb.sys minidriver provided with the operating system. See the  Running the HID Minidriver Sample  section below. The minidriver sample is simple. It does two things:  Waits for LED commands to come from the system. Recall keyboard LEDs report the NUM_LOCK, CAP_LOCK, and SCROLL_LOCK state. Completes read IRPs when LED commands are received. The read IRP s data buffer is filled with  keystroke  reports, causing the LED state to be fed into the system keyboard buffer. Running the HID Minidriver Sample To run the HID minidriver sample, follow these steps. Get the source code from the DDK. Build the Hidmini.sys driver and copy it to the \windows\system32\drivers directory on your test computer. Edit the Input.inf file in the %windows%\inf\ directory and change all instances of Hidusb.sys to Hidmini.sys.  This causes the operating system to load the Hidmini.sys driver instead of the Hidusb.sys driver when it detects a USB input device.  Note: Back up the Input.inf file before you overwrite your changes so you can restore the system when you complete your work. Unplug the USB keyboard and shut down your test computer. Plug in a PS/2-style keyboard (if it is not already attached) and reboot the computer.  After the computer reboots, use the PS/2-style keyboard to start Notepad or some other application that displays keystrokes. (The USB keyboard should not be usable.) Plug in the USB keyboard, and then press the CAP_LOCK key on the PS/2-style keyboard.  You should see the string  CAP_LOCK  appear as if you had just typed that string. If not, go to Device Manager , remove the USB keyboard, and then click the Refresh button. This causes the driver database to be rebuilt, resulting in the Hidmini.sys driver being loaded, rather than Hidusb.sys. Examining the HID Minidriver Sample HID minidrivers register themselves with the HID class driver by calling HidRegisterMinidriver function in their DriverEntry routine. This call informs the HID class driver of the minidriver s existence, causing the HID class driver to pass IRPs to the minidriver when appropriate. As with most other WDM drivers, the system calls the AddDevice routine when a new HID device is detected. In this case, the AddDevice routine simply sets up some spinlocks and memory pools to be used while processing read and write IRPs.  Notice that the GET_MINIDRIVER_DEVICE_EXTENSION macro is used to get access to the HIDMINI device extension. This is done because DeviceObject->DeviceExtension points to the HID CLASS device extension, rather than the HIDMINI device extension. Obviously, confusing the HID CLASS device extension with the HIDMINI device extension will cause data corruption or other problems, usually resulting in a delayed kernel-mode crash. The startup process continues with the IRP_MN_START_DEVICE Plug and Play minor IRP, which is handled by the HidMiniStartDevice and HidMiniStartCompletion routines. Later, the HID class driver sends IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR, IOCTL_HID_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR, and IOCTL_HID_GET_STRING IRPs to query various devices properties.  With actual USB HID devices, these routines return strings are usually burned into the device s firmware. In the HID minidriver sample, a HID device is simulated; therefore; these strings are hard-coded in the driver. When one of these IRPs is received, the HID minidriver sample simply copies the appropriate strings into the IRP s UserBuffer. The format of the descriptor strings is described in the USB HID specification. The MyReportDescriptor and MyHidDescriptor variables are defined in the Hid.c file. Next, examine the reads and writes. When the HID class driver receives write requests from the system, the HID class driver sends an IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT IRP. The sample minidriver routes this IRP to the HidMiniWriteReport routine. By simulating hardware that cannot continuously receive data, the HidMiniWriteReport routine queues the IRP and marks it pending after performing other processing.  To simulate the device issuing an interrupt that indicates it s ready to receive data, the HidMiniWriteReport routine launches a timer. In this case, think of the timer s DPC routine as being the DPC routine that would handle a real device s interrupt to indicate that it s ready to receive more data. The DPC routine calls the HidMiniWriteCompletion to finish the write request and complete the IRP. The HidMiniWriteCompletion routine is discussed in more detail later in this section. The system issues write reports when it has something to tell the device. In the case of a USB keyboard, the system only needs to tell the keyboard what LED lights to turn on and off to indicate the CAP, NUM, and SCROLL lock state. So after a CAP, NUM, or SCROLL lock keystroke is detected on the PS/2-style keyboard, the system sends a new  set LED  command to the USB keyboard to keep both keyboards in the same CAP, NUM, and SCROLL lock state.  Because of a peculiarity in the HID class driver, the data in the IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT IRP s UserBuffer is not valid after returning from the HidMiniIoctl routine and thus cannot be used in the HidMiniWriteCompletion routine. To work around this limitation, the contents of the UserBuffer must either be copied or processed in the HidMiniWriteReport routine. In this case, the sample is interested only in what LEDs have changed state so it can feed the appropriate string into the system keyboard buffer. So the delta in the LED state is computed and queued with the IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT IRP. HidMiniWriteCompletion first removes a queued IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT IRP and the corresponding encoded LED information. It then translates the encoded state into an English string, which is queued up in the OutputRawQueue to be used by the HidMiniReadCompletion code. The system sends read IRPs to the HID class driver when it wants to find out what keys were either pressed or released. In Windows NT 5.0, the system always tries to keep two outstanding read requests: one to detect a key being depressed and one to detect a key being released. Read requests are sent to the HID minidriver using the IOCTL_HID_READ_REPORT IRP, which initially is sent to the HidMiniReadReport routine. HidMiniReadReport simply marks the IRP as pending and stores the IRP in a queue that is later processed by the HidMiniReadCompletion routine.  The HidMiniReadCompletion routine runs in one of the system worker threads. When it detects that it has an outstanding read request, it removes the read IRP and tries to determine whether the HidMiniWriteCompletion routine has put data in the OutputRawQueue. If the data is found in the queue, a single byte is removed and translated into an eight-byte HID keyboard report using the CharToDescriptor routine. (See the USB HID specification at http://www.usb.org/developers/index.html for the format of HID keyboard reports.) With actual HID devices connected using USB, read descriptors are retrieved directly from the hardware and no translation of descriptors is necessary. Finally, the HID descriptor data is copied to the IOCTL_HID_READ_REPORT IRP s UserBuffer, and the IRP is completed. To simulate the key being released, the subsequent IOCTL_HID_READ_REPORT IRP is completed with a NULL report. This is controlled by the rest static variable. By generating read descriptors, the HID minidriver sample can place keystrokes in the system keyboard buffer, which in turn are inserted into the Notepad application.  ~ztnjfb ~zvrlfb {wsokg Normal Default Paragraph Font

Note that this diagram is simplified to show only the flow that occurs when legacy applications require the services of HID-enabled devices. The presence of the legacy device drivers, for example, means that a legacy device minidriver can co-exist with th
is HID architecture. And HID-aware applications can take a more direct path to the HID Class Driver.
\par The VXDCLNT files comprise a nearly-complete code outline for a HID mapper VxD. The source code is fairly self-explanatory through comments. Use code from the sample to create your own VxD mapper. Search for the string \ldblquote <<COMPLETE>>\rdblquote 
 to identify sections requiring device-specific code, which you will need to provide.
\par \pard \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar This paper describes kernel routines that must be used by a HID mapper VxD. It also covers some programming considerations specific to this sort of driver.
\par \pard\plain \s1\sb200\sa80\sl-440\slmult0\keepn\nowidctlpar\tx720 \f4\fs34 HID Mapper Implementation
\par \pard\plain \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar \f4\fs21 The basic activity of VXDCLNT is fairly simple.
\par \pard \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar Whenever a device is plugged in (i.e
. VXDCLNT.VXD gets the SYS_DYNAMIC_DEVICE_INIT or PNP_NEW_DEVNODE message), it checks for new devices by calling ConnectNTDeviceDrivers(). This dispatches WorkItemCallback_Open() on a worker thread (see Programming Considerations for a discussion of work 
items) which invokes IoGetDeviceClassAssociations() to get a list of available devices. VXDCLNT opens these devices in turn via _NtKernCreateFile() and uses IOCTL calls to query each device in order to determine if the device is one that VXDCLNT wants to 
control.
\par \pard \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar If VXDCLNT is not interested in the device, the device is promptly closed. Otherwise, VXDCLNT builds a {\i deviceContext}
 context for the device and does an initial read on the device via NtKernReadFile(). NtKernReadFile() has an asynchronous behavior \endash 
 the read data is returned via a callback routine, which in VXDCLNT is ReadCompletion(). ReadCompletion() processes a devic
e report as follows: it uses HIDPARSE functions to parse meaningful values out of the report and then calls some legacy driver to act 
on the new device state. ReadCompletion() then dispatches another worker thread to do the next read via another NtKernReadFile() call.
\par \pard \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar 
If a read ever fails the mapper must close the device and then try to re-open it. If the mapper ever gets a SYS_DYNAMIC_DEVICE_EXIT message, it must wait for all reads to complete, then close all devices, free all resources, and exit.
\par \pard \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar That\rquote s it. That\rquote s the entire behavior of a HID mapper.

\par \pard\plain \s26\sa160\nowidctlpar \f4\fs21 This section describes kernel support routines for Ring-0 HID mapper V

s for the support routines are given below.

Descriptor Tool, Version 2.4

The major changes to 2.4 are:

1) Fixed monitor enumerated values. Needed to have usage 1 display "Enum 0".
   Added REPEATING0 option to .UPG files to fix this.

2) Added a title bar to the Usage Page Dialog box.

3) Fixed incorrect Extended Usages during inital insertion.

4) Added concatonation of Ordinal Instance value to Usages in collection
   immediately following Ordinal declaration.

5) Fixed display of Extended Usages when No Data option is selected.

6) Added support for Vendor Defined Usage Tables.


The major changes to Version 2.3 are:

1) added sizable window


The major changes to 2.0 are:

1) Incorporated the HID syntax checker from HIDview.

2) The Usage Pages are all ASCII files that can be modified by the user.

3) Extended Usages are supported.

4) Added cut and paste.

5) Report Descriptors files can be saved as .HID, .TXT, .INC, and .H. Only .HID can be read. 

6) Included examples from the HID spec. and the Usage Table document.

7) Fixed numerous bugs.



/************************************************************************
Instructions:

DT.INI must reside in the same directory as DT.EXE.

Usage pages can be added or modified. To add a Usage Page create a text
.UPG file as described below then add an Usage Page (UPn) entry to DT.INI.

NOTE: When saving a file in a format other than .HID be sure to
change the extension otherwise the .HID file will be overwritten.

****************************     WARNING      ***************************
The usages pages (.UPG files) from the 9.0 Release Candidate USB HID Usage
Tables document are included here. These pages are included for convienence
and may change in the final release of the document.
****************************     WARNING      ***************************


/************************************************************************
HID Spec issues:

1) Vendor defined Collection IDs are not supported by DT.

2) Extended Usages are 32-bit usages where the high order 16-bits are the
Usage Page ID and the low order 16-bits are the Usage ID. These are useful
when usages from different Usage Pages are required for the same Main Item.
Memphis supports extended usages. Extended Usages are not defined in the
HID 1.0 Specification.

3) Extended usage values for Usage Minimum and Maximum (32 bit parameters)
are also supported by DT. Memphis supports this too.

4) Memphis has the following restrictions on delimiters:
 - Do not use delimiters for usages associated with top level (application)
       collections.
 - Only Usages are supported in delimiters. Usage Min, Usage Max, Designators
       and Strings are NOT allowed in a delimited set.
 - Delimiters are not allowed when defining usages associated with an Array.

5) The checker (Parse Descriptor) does not support:
 -- Push and Pop - False errors will be reported due to state variables that
are not saved and restored.

 -- Extended Usages - The checker will report extended usages as "undefined"
because it does not break the 32-bit value into Usage and Usage Page.

HID Descriptor Tool V0.3
Provided by Steve McGowan at Intel Architecture Lab.

OVERVIEW

This is a Beta version of the HID Descriptor Tool. It supports:

1) Improved editing: Item Insert and Edit.

2) Improved formating: Indentation as a funciton of collections.

3) HID Version 1.0 Usage pages: Gerneric Desktop, Keyboard, LED and
Button. As well as VR, Vehicle, Sport and Game Control Usage pages.

OPERATION

To add items to your Report descriptor double click on an Item in
the HID Items window.

To insert an item in a Report Descriptor click on an item in
the Report Descriptor window to select a position then double click
on an Item in the HID Items window that you want to insert. Or you
can right click on the line below where you want to insert a line
and select "Insert".

To modify an item in the Report Descriptor double click on an
item in the Report Descriptor window. Or you can right click on
the line below where you want to modify and select "Edit".
Note: Clearing a descriptor leaves the .HID file open.
	  
RELEASE NOTES FOR V0.3

- Indentation as a function of collections does not always work
right. If you want something nice to print out. Save the file
and read it back in again.

- Once you start inserting you cannot insert an item after the
last line.

- The Parse Descriptor command has not been tested.

As hard realtime as possible. Reliable scheduling.  Ideally threads keep running even if Windows crashes. Very fast thread switching. Both hard up front CPU reservation and automatic statistically generated reservations possible. Clean and simple design and API. Fundamental Principles In order to achieve the above goals, the following principles were applied as much as possible when designing this service. The realtime scheduler is the highest priority software running on the machine. Only the realtime scheduler can take control from realtime threads. A realtime thread cannot hold off the realtime thread scheduler. One realtime thread cannot prevent another realtime thread from running on schedule. No system service or driver can prevent realtime threads from running as scheduled. CPU is allocated to realtime threads when they are created.  If insufficient CPU is available then the realtime thread creation fails. The realtime scheduler overhead should be as small as possible. Switching realtime threads should be as fast as possible. Realtime thread load should be as finely granular as feasible. Realtime thread load should be distributed as evenly over the realtime thread period as possible. Atomic operations block the thread that requires them.  They do not affect the schedules of other realtime threads. The WDM realtime API is for use by kernel mode drivers only.  Since the realtime threads run at IRQL>DISPATCH_LEVEL all memory they touch must be locked down and all functions they call must be safe to call at raised IRQL. The API can be broken down into the following categories: Retrieving information about the system (RtVersion) Creating and destroying realtime threads (RtCreateThread, RtDestroyThread) Allowing other realtime threads to run (RtYield) Synchronization (KeAcquireSpinLock, KeReleaseSpinLock) Dynamic management of real-time threads (RtAdjustCpuLoad) Hardware Requirements: Currently the realtime executive runs only on machines that have a local apic that can be enabled.  It also requires the presence of performance counters.  Current processors which have a local apic that can be enabled by software are Intel Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Celeron processors.  All of those processors are based on the P6 core.  All of those processors also have performance counters.  The AMD K7 also has a local apic and performance counters that can be enabled successfully by software and the realtime executive does run on K7 processors.  Currently Intel Pentium machines and AMD K6, K6-2, and K6-III processors do not support the realtime executive. Some of the Pentium II/Celeron processors that are shipped in notebook or mobile configurations do NOT support turning on the local apic.  The realtime executive will not run on those machines.  New mobile processors from Intel (Coppermine) will support the local apic and the realtime executive should run on those machines. How to use this guide This guide should help you add a real-time thread to your kernel-mode driver. It will outline each service provided by the realtime API and describe the structures that are used as parameters for these services. Chapter Detailed information about the proposed WDM RealTime API Retrieving Information about the System NTSTATUS  RtVersion( OUT PULONG Version ) The RtVersion function returns a status that indicates whether realtime services are currently running and available on the machine.  This function can also store the version number of the currently running realtime executive.  This function may be called from any thread, Windows or realtime. Input parameters It takes one input parameter, a pointer to the ULONG location to fill with the version number.  This parameter may be NULL and if it is, then the version number information is not written.  If the version pointer is not NULL the version information will always be written, regardless of the status code returned by this function. Output parameters The version number is in the format xx.xx.xxxx where each xx is 1 byte of the ULONG and the ordering left-to-right is high-order byte to low-order byte. For example, 0x010a0104 is version 1.10.260 Return value This function can be used to determine whether realtime services are supported on the current machine. If the realtime executive is running this function will return STATUS_SUCCESS. If for some reason the realtime executive is not running and realtime services are not available on this machine, then STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL will be returned. Creating and destroying realtime threads  NTSTATUS  RtCreateThread( ULONGLONG Period, ULONGLONG Duration, ULONG Flags, ULONG StackSize, RTTHREADPROC RtThread, IN PVOID pRtThreadContext, OUT PHANDLE pRtThreadHandle The RtCreateThread function creates a realtime thread.  This function can only be called from within a standard Windows thread.  It MUST not be called from within a realtime thread. Input parameters Period Period determines the frequency with which the realtime thread must be run.  It is always specified in units of time.  All time parameters are specified in units of picoseconds (10e-12 seconds).  This means the maximum period that can be specified is ~213 days.  The following predefined constants should be used when specifying time: #define WEEK 604800000000000000 #define DAY  86400000000000000 #define HOUR 3600000000000000 #define MIN  60000000000000 #define SEC  1000000000000 #define MSEC 1000000000 #define USEC 1000000 #define NSEC 1000 #define PSEC 1 Duration Duration is the amount of time within the period that the realtime thread will need to run. Percentage CPU load can be calculated as 100*(Duration/Period) as long as Duration and Period are both specified in units of time.  Duration may be specified as 0 in which case the realtime scheduler will dynamically allocate CPU to the realtime thread based on statistics generated as the thread runs.  In that case a thread MUST call RtYield at the end of each period to indicate to the scheduler when it is done with the processing for each period.  The scheduler uses that information to dynamically adjust the CPU allocated to that client.  If this type of client never calls RtYield, or always calls RtYield late for the current period, its CPU allocation will remain pegged at all of the remaining CPU cycles and no other clients RtCreateThread calls will succeed.  Note that Windows is allocated some minimum CPU bandwidth so real time threads can never prevent windows from running. Flags Attributes of your thread.  The predefined constants in which can be specified: Hardware: USESFLOAT Thread will use floating point instructions USESMMX Thread will use MMX instructions Duration Units: Duration is specified in units of time CPUCYCLES Duration is specified in a count of CPU cycles StackSize StackSize is the size of the stack required by the realtime thread in 4k blocks.  Currently StackSize must be between 1 and 8 inclusive.  RtCreateThread will fail  with STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL for any other values of StackSize. RtThread Entry point for the realtime thread function. pRtThreadContext Pointer to context information that is passed to your thread function as its Context parameter.  This parameter may be NULL, in that case a NULL pointer will be passed as your functions Context parameter. Output parameters pRtThreadHandle pRtThreadHandle is a pointer to an RtThreadHandle that can be output from RtCreateThread.  pRtThreadHandle can be NULL, in which case no RtThreadHandle is returned.  Storage for the HANDLE RtThreadHandle must be allocated by the code that calls RtCreateThread. RealTime thread function parameters typedef VOID (*RTTHREADPROC)(PVOID Context, ThreadStats *Statistics); The realtime thread is called with 2 parameters:  its Context, and a pointer to a read only copy of statistical information that is maintained by the realtime executive and is updated every time contol is passed to the realtime thread. typedef struct threadstats { ULONGLONG Period; // First entries are RtCreateThread parameters. ULONGLONG Duration; ULONG Flags; ULONG StackSize; ULONGLONG periodindex; ULONGLONG timesliceindex; ULONGLONG timesliceindexthisperiod; ULONGLONG thisperiodstarttime; ULONGLONG thistimeslicestarttime; ULONGLONG remainingdurationthisperiod; } ThreadStats; Return value RtCreateThread returns STATUS_SUCCESSFUL if the realtime thread was successfully created and added to the realtime thread list.  Otherwise STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL or STATUS_NO_MEMORY is returned. NTSTATUS  RtDestroyThread( IN HANDLE RtThreadHandle  The RtDestroyThread function removes the realtime thread indicated by RtThreadHandle from the list of running realtime threads, and releases the resources and cpu allocation associated with that thread.  This function can only be called from within a normal Windows thread.  It MUST not be called from within a realtime thread. Input parameters RtThreadHandle A handle to the realtime thread to be destroyed. Output parameters This function has no output parameters. Return value This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it finds a realtime thread with the passed in handle and successfully releases all of the resources allocated with this thread. It returns STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL if it there is no realtime thread with the passed in handle. Allowing other realtime threads to run  VOID  RtYield( ULONGLONG Mark, ULONGLONG Delta The RtYield function will yield execution to other realtime threads in the system. It should be called whenever a realtime thread does not require further CPU resources. Input parameters This is an absolute time which will be subtracted from the current time by the scheduler whenever it is deciding whether or not to run this thread.  When the current scheduler time minus the Mark is greater or equal to the Delta time, then the thread can be run.  Note that this scheduler algorithm always assumes this time is in the past.  All time parameters are specified in units of picoseconds (10e-12 seconds). Delta This is a delta time from the Mark that indicates the point in time up to which this thread should not be run.  All time parameters are specified in units of picoseconds (10e-12 seconds). Output parameters This function has no output parameters. Return value This function has no return value.  This function cannot fail.  It will yield the specified amount of time.  Note that in the special case when both Mark and Delta are passed in as zero, rather than not yielding at all, the function will yield the rest of is current timeslice.  Which in general is an indeterminate amount of time. Synchronization Since realtime threads run at IRQL>DISPATCH_LEVEL, currently the only syncronization functions provided for them are KeAcquireSpinLock and KeReleaseSpinLock.  These allow realtime threads to syncronize with existing system code when required.  Note that when a realtime thread tries to acquire a held spinlock, it blocks until the spinlock is released.  Ideally realtime threads should be written using lock free algorithms and should not take spinlocks unless absolutely necessary. Dynamic management of real-time threads NTSTATUS  RtAdjustCpuLoad( ULONGLONG Period, ULONGLONG Duration, ULONG Flags The RtAdjustCpuLoad function changes the cpu allocation of the currently running realtime thread.  This function can only be called from within a realtime thread.  If a realtime thread requires more CPU or does not need some of the CPU it has allocated it should call this function. Input parameters Period Period determines the frequency with which the realtime thread must be run.  It is always specified in units of time.  All time parameters are specified in units of picoseconds (10e-12 seconds).  This means the maximum period that can be specified is ~213 days.  This may be changed as needed from the value passed at thread creation time. Duration Time needed to complete the operations each time the thread is called.  This may be changed as needed from the value passed at thread creation time.  Note that the units for this parameter may also be changed by modifying the Flags parameter. Flags The hardware Flags must exactly match the hardware Flags that were passed at thread creation time.  The other Flags may be changed.  The predefined Flag values which can be specified: Hardware: USESFLOAT Thread will use floating point instructions USESMMX Thread will use MMX instructions Duration Units: Duration is specified in units of time CPUCYCLES Duration is specified in a count of CPU cycles Output parameters This function has no output parameters. Return value This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the CPU allocation was successfully changed for this thread.  Otherwise this function returns STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL and the CPU resources allocated to this thread remain unchanged.  If any of the parameters are invalid (changing hardware flags to values different from those passed at thread create time for example) then STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

SAMPLE WDM USB DRIVER AND DEBUG APPLICATION
							Revision 1.4
   						   January 8, 1997
   						   RELEASE NOTES
    			           -------------

Changes in Revision 1.4:
------------------------

1). Changed call IoAttachDeviceByPointer to new call:
	IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack.
2). Enhanced sample Win32 Application to show how to open Sample driver and perform 
	IOCTL calls by adding support for reading/writing bulk or interrupt 
	endpoints.


Existing Issues/Notes:
----------------------

    1). New USBD services will simplify some of the code in this driver.  See the
        code for comments on such cases.
    2). This driver is based on information available at the time of development, and
        is subject to change depending on system software interface changes.  Please
        consult documentation on the Windows Driver Model for complete information.
    3). To build this driver, you will need the Windows NT DDK as well as the updated
        header and library files to support the Windows Driver Model.  In addition,
        the appropriate USB header and library files are necessary.
    4). The code that handles PnP Power Messages has not been fully tested.
    	That work is ongoing and any changes/updates will be issued in a future 
    	release of this sample driver.
   	5). To use the sample application, you will need to build it in the 
	   	Microsoft Visual C++ (MSDEV) build environment first.  The sample 
	   	application is intended to show how to communicate with the sample 
	   	driver in a rudimentary fashion only.
	6). If the Application's makefile (sampapp.mak) doesn't work in MSDEV, just create a 
		new workspace in MSDEV (use "Application" as the application "type" in the 
		"New Project Workspace") and add the source files to the project 
		manually (main.c, sampapp.rc).  Please note that you must add the path 
		to the include files in your Project Settings (under the C/C++ tab, in 
		the "preprocessor" item in the dropdown box).  Make sure you add the 
		path to the "devioctl.h" file in that list of paths since the sample.h 
		file uses a macro from the devioctl.h file.

Windows 2000 and Windows 98 WDM layered architecture The following modules are shown from bottom-up in Figure 1. PCI Enumerator takes care of loading the USB driver stack components when a USB bus is detected on a PC platform, and always loads at least the other core components. UHCB.SYS and OHCB.SYS are USB host controller drivers. (OHCB.SYS for the Open Host Controller Interface or UHCB.SYS for the Universal Host Controller Interface) USBD.SYS is the USB class driver. USBHUB.SYS is the USB hub driver. It is loaded if the PCI enumerator detects a USB hub. WCEUSBSH.SYS is the Windows CE USB Serial Host driver. Overview The target platforms are Windows 2000 and Windows 98. Plug-and-Play, binary compatible (x86), WDM driver Windows NT 4.0 has no native USB support and is therefore not supported. Although there are 3rd party USB stacks available for NT 4.0, these drivers have interfaces incompatible with the Microsoft Windows USB drivers.  This driver will not work with these external drivers. The driver supports multiple WCE USB Function Devices, limited by the number USB ports, memory, etc. However, ActiveSync 3.1 currently supports only one device. On the top-edge, the driver exposes a standard Win32 file-device interface and a Serial-Port interface. On the bottom-edge, the driver uses the USB Client Driver Interface to communicate with the Windows CE USB Function Device. This uses the native USBDI stack services. Installation The driver is detected and installed by the Platform s USB Hub enumerator on the first physical insertion into a USB Port. When you plug in the device, the "Found New Hardware Wizard" should kick in and install the driver via an install script (INF) without any user intervention. Vendors wishing to have their hardware enumerated must add their PnP hardware PID&VID to the installation script WCEUSBSH.INF, following the three documented sections <VENDOR SECTION> in that file. After the driver is initially installed, you can plug and unplug at will and the driver will load/unload without the user being prompted to re-install. Uninstall To completely uninstall the driver you must use the system s Hardware Wizard, and optionally purge the system registry and remove all files. Win 2000: Use Hardware Wizard \ Uninstall \ Uninstall a device \ Show Hidden \ then, select and remove all previously installed devices under Windows CE USB Devices. OPTIONAL: Delete %WINNT%\INF\oem* and %WINNT%\System32\drivers\wceusbs* Note that the \INF dir is system hidden by default. Delete from the Win 2000 Registry: HKLM\System\CCS\Control\Class\{25dbce51-6c8f-4a72-8a6d-b54c2b4fc835} HKLM\System\CCS\Control\DeviceClasses\{25dbce51-6c8f-4a72-8a6d-b54c2b4fc835} HKLM\System\CCS\Services\EventLog\System\ WCEUSBSH HKLM\System\CCS\Services\WCEUSBSH Reboot Win 98: Use Device Manager to uninstall the device. OPTIONAL: Delete %WINDOWS%\INF\OTHER\*WCE* and  %WINDOWS%\System32\drivers\wceusbs* Delete from the Win 98 Registry: HKLM\Enum\WCE* HKLM\System\CCS\Control\DeviceClasses\{25dbce51-6c8f-4a72-8a6d-b54c2b4fc835} HKLM\System\CCS\Services\Class\{25dbce51-6c8f-4a72-8a6d-b54c2b4fc835} HKLM\System\CCS\Services\Class\WCE* Reboot NOTE:  If the user does not manually run an Uninstall (Wizard or DevMgr) then you must remove USB's enumeration info. There can be multiple entries under USB's key because it enumerates per port. Win2000: HKLM\System\CCS\Enum\USB\Vid_Xxxx&Pid_Xxxx Win98: HKLM\Enum\USB\Vid_Xxxx&Pid_Xxxx Programming Interface The driver exposes a standard Win32 file-device interface, so an app can open it directly. The device name is WCEUSBSHx, where x is the 3-digit ones-based instance number 001, 002, etc. So, for example, you would use CreateFile(  \\.\wceusbsh001  ) to talk the first instance of the device, CreateFile(  \\.\wceusbsh002  ) to talk with the second device instance and perform multiple concurrent I/O. Windows 2000 ONLY: the driver exposes a Serial-Port (FILE_DEVICE_SERIAL_PORT) interface on the top-edge for legacy application debugging. Your legacy test application can open the device as a Communications Resource  , where x = 0 n. So, for example, on a desktop PC with 2 serial ports and a WCE USB Function Device installed as COM3 - you would use CreateFile(   ) to talk to the WCE device. You can then use the Communications API set documented in the Platform SDK.  NOTE: this interface is for debug purposes only, and is not enabled by default. To enable the COMx interface you must add the following Registry value: HKLM\System\CCS\Services\WCEUSBSH\Parameters\REG_DWORD: ExposeComPort:0x1 On Win98 you cannot access the driver as a Communications Resource (COMx) using the familiar Comm API, because the API gets trapped by VCOMM. This requires the driver to be installed as a virtual modem, and use of ccport.sys and wdmmdmld.vxd. These intermediate driver layers proved unacceptable for use with this driver. However, you can directly access the WDM driver on Win98 using the Win32 file-device interface, and use DeviceIoControl directly for the IOCTL_SERIAL_Xxx. These IOCTLs directly correspond to the Comm API set. The following IOCTLs are implemented to emulate a serial-port NULL modem. These IOCTLs directly correspond to the Comm API set. IOCTL_SERIAL_CLR_DTR IOCTL_SERIAL_CLR_RTS IOCTL_SERIAL_CONFIG_SIZE IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_BAUD_RATE IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_CHARS IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_COMMSTATUS IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_DTRRTS IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_HANDFLOW IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_LINE_CONTROL IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_MODEMSTATUS IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_PROPERTIES IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_TIMEOUTS IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_WAIT_MASK IOCTL_SERIAL_IMMEDIATE_CHAR IOCTL_SERIAL_PURGE IOCTL_SERIAL_RESET_DEVICE IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_BAUD_RATE IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_CHARS IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_DTR IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_HANDFLOW IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_LINE_CONTROL IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_QUEUE_SIZE IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_RTS IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_TIMEOUTS IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_WAIT_MASK IOCTL_SERIAL_WAIT_ON_MASK These IOCTLs are documented in the Win2000 DDK. Also, see ntddser.h in the DDK. Note that the driver can be surprise-removed at anytime by the user simply unplugging the USB device. The host driver registers a Device Class GUID {25dbce51-6c8f-4a72-8a6d-b54c2b4fc835} for system-wide PnP Event Notification. Both user-mode and kernel-mode components can receive these PnP Events and act accordingly. See the Platform SDK and the Win 2000 DDK for more information on using PnP notifications. NOTE:  the following describes the disappearing COM port problem. If the app has an open handle to the driver and you unplug (and potentially re-plug the USB device) then the 1st device instance tries to unload, and does so up to the point of physically removing itself from the system. It can't complete however, because the app has an outstanding handle open on it. If you then re-plug the USB device, with the 1st instance still up, then a 2nd instance is created by the system creating a new file device   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\\\wceusbsh002"  \\.\\wceusbsh002  or COM4. If the legacy app is not monitoring the PnP events then it still thinks it has a valid handle to COM3, where that instance is now inactive and rejects all I/O. If the app is monitoring PnP events, then it will see that the 1st instance is being removed, and should release the handle. The PC host driver currently does not support device power states, remote wake, etc. These must first be supported in the WCE device. The WCE function driver will see Power Down / Power UP messages every time the device powers on/off.  You will therefore see it as a device unplug/re-plug on the host side. The host driver supports Block Write requests of up to 128 kb. Larger write requests are rejected, and should be broken up by the test application. The host driver currently does NOT send a zero-length packet, to indicate the end of a transaction, for write requests that are multiples of the endpoint s wMaxPacketSize. The application should simply send an additional zero length write via WriteFile( hDevice, NULL, 0, &dwBtyes,  NULL ).  This note applies to test applications using the host driver for host-to-host communications only; it does not affect host-to-function data flow. USB Interface The host driver assumes 1 Interface, which contains 1 bulk read, 1 bulk write, and 1 optional interrupt endpoint. It also assumes  bInterfaceClass = 0xFF. The driver makes no best effort attempts to check for multiple bulk endpoints. The host driver assumes these endpoints reside on AltenateSetting 0. However, the AlternateSetting can be changed via registry key and re-plugging the device: On Win2000   HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet\Services\wceusbsh\Parameters\REG_DWORD:AlternateSetting:0xXX On Win98 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\WCESUSB\000*\ Parameters\REG_DWORD:AlternateSetting:0xXX Where * is the instance number. DTR/RTS Status Line Emulation: the driver issues a Class specific request to indicate the state of the host output control lines.  bmRequestType 00100001B (0x21h) bRequest  SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE  ( 0x22h ) wValue  Control Signal BitMask wIndex Interface wLength The wValue bitmask is defined as : D15..D2  Reserved RTS state  (1=Active, 0=Inactive) DTR state  (1=Active, 0=Inactive) The WCE driver will emulate a typical NULL modem cable, such that the DCD and DSR state will follow the host DTR, and CTS state will follow host RTS. NOTE: when ActiveSync tries to connect it will attempt to make two calls to SET_DTR. The function driver must be able to handle these. (Optional) Interrupt Endpoint: this endpoint is used to indicate the availability of IN data, as well as to reflect the state of the device serial control lines: D15..D3 Reserved DSR state  (1=Active, 0=Inactive) CTS state  (1=Active, 0=Inactive) Data Available  - (1=Host should read IN endpoint, 0=No data currently available) When the Data Ready bit is set the host driver will put a timeout value on IN endpoint reads, and will continue polling the IN endpoint as long as there is data or until the timeout expires. The default timeout is 1280 msec, and is registry configurable. HKLM\System\CCS\Services\wceusbsh\Parameters\InterruptTimeout:REG_DWORD:0xXX The value is in msec. Note: when the timeout fires the host driver must tell the USB stack to cancel the read on the IN endpoint, which takes an indeterminate amount of time to complete. During development it took ~73 msec on a P300 MP machine, or ~14 msec on a single proc P90, depending on where the USB stack was in it s processing. This means if you set the timeout value too low then you will spend the bulk of the time waiting for the IN endpoint read to cancel, instead of actually doing reads. If you set the value too high then you effectively act like a driver without an INT endpoint   always polling for read data. The idea behind the INT endpoint is to keep the desktop s USB Host Controller from always polling the USB Bus, which ties up the desktop s PCI bus.  Note: there is a one second keep alive between the host and function upper layer protocols. A value too small or large could effect this timing. Device Errors The host driver writes error log information to My Computer \ System Tools \ Event Viewer \ System. If the host driver fails to get USB descriptors, or set a configuration, then an error log is written and the driver will fail to load. If there are device errors detected on the device BULK ENDPOINTS (as reported by the native USB stack) then the host driver will attempt to reset the failing endpoint. There is a maximum number of consecutive retries by the host driver. If the endpoint fails to recover after the maximum number of consecutive retries then an error log is written, and the driver is disabled. The driver will then show in Device Manager as  No Longer Functioning The default maximum number of consecutive bulk endpoint retries is 100. The maximum number of bulk endpoint retries is registry configurable under: On Win2000 HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet\Services\wceusbsh\Parameters\REG_DWORD: MaxPipeErrors:0xXX On Win98 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\WCESUSB\000*\ Parameters\REG_DWORD: MaxPipeErrors:0xXX Where * is the instance number. The maximum number of command retries sent on endpoint 0 (e.g. SET_DTR) is hard coded to two. This value will not change because commands on EP0 should never fail unless the device is bad ActiveSync retries commands (e.g. SET_DTR), so we need a way to detect, disable, and inform the user that device is not responding. The error log dump data can be viewed in the Event Viewer as an array of DWORDS, and is interpreted as an IO_ERROR_LOG_PACKET, as defined in the Win2000 DDK: typedef struct _IO_ERROR_LOG_PACKET (     UCHAR MajorFunctionCode;     UCHAR RetryCount;     USHORT DumpDataSize;     USHORT NumberOfStrings;     USHORT StringOffset;     USHORT EventCategory;     NTSTATUS ErrorCode;     ULONG UniqueErrorValue;     NTSTATUS FinalStatus;     ULONG SequenceNumber;     ULONG IoControlCode;     LARGE_INTEGER DeviceOffset;     ULONG DumpData[1]; }IO_ERROR_LOG_PACKET, *PIO_ERROR_LOG_PACKET; Caller-supplied data in the packet includes the following:  Member Meaning MajorFunctionCode The IRP_MJ_XXX of the current IRP. RetryCount A count of how many times the caller has retried the operation and encountered the same error. DumpDataSize The number of bytes of caller-suplied DumpData, if any. NumberOfStrings The number of insertion strings supplied following the DumpData; the initial string, if any, is assumed to be the driver name or that of the target device object. StringOffset The offset, immediately following any DumpData, of the caller-supplied, zero-terminated Unicode insertion strings, if any. EventCategory A caller-determined value matching that in the caller's message file for categories if the driver set itself up in the registry as an event-logging component; otherwise, zero. ErrorCode An IO_ERR_XXX value. UniqueErrorValue A driver-determined value that indicates where in the driver the error was encountered. FinalStatus The STATUS_XXX value to be set in the I/O status block of the IRP or a STATUS_XXX returned by a support routine. SequenceNumber A driver-assigned number for the current IRP, constant for the life of the request. IoControlCode An IOCTL_XXX if MajorFunctionCode is IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL, or IRP_MJ_SCSI; otherwise, zero. DeviceOffset The offset on the device where the error occurred, or zero. DumpData Caller-supplied data, such as device register contents, if DumpDataSize is nonzero.

Note that there is currently no WHQL classification for these devices, so testing must be provided by the OEMs. Desktop testing is required to ensure the device consistently enumerates at the root hub, as well as (at least) 5 hubs deep. The device should consistently enumerate during PnP (plug/unplug) and device power down/up. The WCE device should not cause other USB devices to be ejected from the USB while attached, or while detaching from the port, so testing should be performed with other USB devices both upstream and downstream.

This document provides you with information on installing these drivers, bug reporting process and any late breaking news. This Beta of USB 2.0 is scheduled to expire on September 1st, 2001. At that time you will be required to obtain updated drivers from Microsoft, to regain full functionality. USB Architecture The following sections describe the USB driver stack on Windows 2000 & Windows XP. Windows 2000 USB Driver Stack The following figure illustrates the WDM driver stack that is created in Microsoft  Windows  2000 for a USB device with a single interface. At the bottom of the Windows 2000 USB driver stack is the host controller driver. It consists of a class/miniclass driver pair. The host controller class driver, usbd.sys, is paired either with the openhci.sys (Open Host Controller Interface) minidriver or with the uhcd.sys (Universal Host Controller Driver) minidriver, depending on which USB protocol the system is configured to use. The host controller class driver handles those aspects of the port driver's duties that are independent of the specific protocol. Immediately above the host controller class driver is the USB bus driver, usbhub.sys, also known as the hub driver. This is the device driver for each hub on the system. Above the hub driver sits the client device driver. This might be a vendor-supplied device driver or it might be a system-supplied driver or driver stack. For instance, most USB input devices are managed by a system-supplied HID class/miniclass driver pair (hidclass.sys and hidusb.sys) that sits on top of the USB stack. For more information on the HID driver stack, see Driver Stacks for HID Devices. In the case of composite devices, the hub driver not only drives the hub, but will also provide a generic parent facility between the hub and the various interfaces of the device. For an example of the device stack for a composite device in WIndows 2000, see Windows 2000 USB Device Stack. Windows XP USB Driver Stack The following figure illustrates the WDM driver stack that is created in Windows XP for two USB devices, one composite and one non-composite. The composite device has two interfaces, each of which is driven by a separate client driver.  INCLUDEPICTURE "..\\art\\usbstkXP.wmf" \* MERGEFORMAT  There are two significant differences between the Windows 2000 and Windows XP USB driver stacks.  First, the USB device stack for Windows XP is designed to facilitate the addition of a USB 2.0 miniport driver, usbehci.sys, which Microsoft has developed for the purpose of supporting high-speed USB 2.0 technology. This miniport driver is not shipped with the initial release of Windows XP, but Microsoft will make it available by employing other distribution methods.  The second significant change in the USB stack is that, for Windows XP, Microsoft supplies a separate generic parent driver for the support of composite USB devices. In Windows 2000, support for composite devices was built into the system-supplied USB bus (or hub) driver.  Additionally, with the Windows XP generic parent driver, Microsoft provides USB Content Security Class functionality for the first time. See USB Common Class Generic Parent Driver for a discussion of this driver.  At the bottom of the Windows XP USB driver stack is the host controller driver. It consists of the port driver, usbport.sys, and one or more of three miniport drivers that run concurrently. When the system detects host controller hardware, it loads one of these miniport drivers. The miniport driver, once loaded,  loads the port driver, usbport.sys. The port driver handles those aspects of the host controller driver's duties that are independent of the specific protocol.  The usbuhci.sys (universal host controller interface) miniport driver replaces the uhcd.sys miniclass driver that shipped with Windows 2000. The usbohci.sys (open host controller interface) miniport driver replaces openhci.sys. See Windows 2000 USB Driver Stack for further information about the Windows 2000 miniclass drivers. In the future, the usbehci.sys miniport driver will be provided to support hi-speed USB devices. Once USB 2.0 support is in place, Windows will support host controller cards with both USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 host controllers on board. On detecting this kind of hardware, Windows will create two separate device objects, one for each host controller, After that, Windows will load the usbehci.sys miniport driver for the USB 2.0-compliant host controller hardware and either usbohci.sys or openhci.sys for the USB 1.1-compliant hardware, depending on the system configuration. Above the port driver is the USB bus driver, usbhub.sys, also known as the hub driver. This is the device driver for each hub on the system.  Each particular device is supported by a USB client driver. Client device drivers for non-composite devices are layered directly above the hub driver. For composite USB devices that expose multiple interfaces and which do not have their own parent class driver, the system loads an extra driver called the USB common class generic parent driver, usbccgp.sys, between the hub driver and the client device drivers. The system assigns each interface of a composite device a separate PDO, and vendors might choose to provide a separate client driver for each interface.  In the case of composite devices, client device drivers are loaded above the generic parent driver. A client driver for a composite device is no different from a client driver for a non-composite devices, except for where it is loaded in the driver stack. Client drivers for composite devices sit above the generic parent driver. Release Notes Periodic Isochronous Transfers Issue: Periodic isochronous transfers do not work. Microsoft is currently developing the necessary infrastructure to support periodic isochronous transfers.  Workaround: No work around. You are encouraged to get in touch with the Microsoft OS USB team directly to obtain additional details. USB Audio Issue: High speed audio devices do not work on windows 2000 and Windows XP. Workaround: The current audio architecture does not work with USB 2.0 audio devices. There are certain changes that can be made in hardware to support Audio. You are encouraged to get in touch with the Microsoft OS USB team directly to obtain additional details. PC Card Eject Issue: Ejecting a PC card may result in a blue screen in Windows XP. This issue is currently being investigated and will be addressed in the next release. Workaround: You are encouraged to shut down or hibernate your machine before removing the card. DVD Playback Issue: DVD playback does no work on Windows XP or Windows 2000. Workaround: You need a software decoder that works with your USB 2.0 device. UI - Incorrect Bandwidth Report Issue: Incorrect bandwidth usage is reported on Windows XP for USB 2.0 controllers.  Workaround: Currently under investigation. UI - High Speed Device in Full Speed port Issue: Incorrect ports shown in USB UI. The USB root ports that are shared between the USB 2.0 host controller and the USB 1.1 host controller are not correctly identified. Workaround: None.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8PURPOSE: Title _PID_GUIDPURPOSE: jdunn Normal.dot jdunn Microsoft Word 8.0@HP LaserJet 5P/5MP PostScript \\msprint9\corpb PSCRIPT HP LaserJet 5P/5MP PostScript HP LaserJet 5P/5MP PostScript Custom page 1 Custom page 2 Custom page 3 HP LaserJet 5P/5MP PostScript Custom page 1 Custom page 2 Custom page 3PURPOSE: To provide a set of  apis in the core USB stack that can be called from user  mode or drivers to determine the topology of the bus and specific information about the devices on the bus including how much isochronous bandwidth they may be using.  Such a user mode application is assumed to have intimate knowledge of USB.  IOCTLS: The IOCTLS are divided in to three groups: IOCTLS sent to the BUS device name, the USB busses in the system follow the naming convention HCD0,HCD1 HCD9 - we support up to 10 controllers in the system. IOCTLS sent to a USB Node,  a USB node is defined to be either the device object for a USB hub or the device object for a USB parent   driver (a USB parent driver ejects PDO for the individual interfaces  of a composite device).  A node connection refers to a physical device object  ejected by either the hub or parent   driver. INTERNAL IOCTLS sent to the PDO passed to a USB device driver when it is loaded.  These are for use by kernel mode drivers and are not accessible from user mode.  Enumerating the bus: The user mode application enumerates the bus by first calling USB_GET_ROOT_HUB_NAME for a given host controller.  Then given the name of the node the application calls GET_NODE_INFORMATION to determine how many connections the node has.  The application can then iterate through all the connections calling GET_CONNECTION_INFORMATION and if the NodeName field is not null on a connection repeat the process with this new NodeName. BUS IOCLTS: IOCTL_USB_GET_ROOT_HUB_NAME inputBuffer/outputBuffer = pointer to buffer for the name of the root hub USB node -- this name may be opened and USB node IOCLTS may be issued to it.  This name corresponds to the root hub of the host controller to which the ioctl is sent. length = HUB_NAME_LENGTH unicode characters long. BUS NODE IOCTLS: IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_INFORMATION                                             typedef enum _USB_HUB_NODE {     UsbHub,     UsbMIParent } USB_HUB_NODE; typedef struct _USB_HUB_INFORMATION {     //     // copy of data from hub descriptor      //     USB_HUB_DESCRIPTOR HubDescriptor;     // max power this hub may supply     LONG MaxPower;     // power currently allocated by this hub     LONG PowerUsed; } USB_HUB_INFORMATION, *PUSB_HUB_INFORMATION; typedef struct _USB_MI_PARENT_INFORMATION {     ULONG NumberOfInterfaces; } USB_MI_PARENT_INFORMATION, *PUSB_MI_PARENT_INFORMATION; typedef struct _USB_NODE_INFORMATION {     USB_HUB_NODE NodeType;        // hub, mi parent     union {         USB_HUB_INFORMATION HubInformation;         USB_MI_PARENT_INFORMATION MiParentInformation;     } u; } USB_NODE_INFORMATION, *PUSB_NODE_INFORMATION; input/output buffer = pointer to USB_NODE_INFORMATION, this information can be used to determine if the node is a hub or a parent driver and how many devices can be attached. length = size of USB_NODE_INFORMATION IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION  typedef struct _USB_PIPE_INFO {     USB_ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTOR EndpointDescriptor; } USB_PIPE_INFO, PUSB_PIPE_INFO; typedef enum _USB_CONNECTION_STATUS {     NoDeviceConnected,     DeviceConnected,     DeviceFailedEnumeration,     DeviceInSuspend TBD need more status codes } USB_CONNECTION_STATUS, *PUSB_CONNECTION_STATUS; typedef struct _USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION {     ULONG ConnectionIndex;     // unicode symbolic name for this node if it is a hub or parent driver     // null if this node is a device.     WCHAR NodeName[HUB_NAME_LENGTH];      // usb device descriptor returned by this device     // during enumeration     USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR DeviceDescriptor;     UCHAR CurrentConfigurationValue;     BOOLEAN LowSpeed;     USHORT DeviceAddress;     // power allocated to this port (in mA)     USHORT MaxPower;      ULONG NumberOfOpenPipes;     USB_CONNECTION_STATUS ConnectionStatus;     USB_PIPE_INFO PipeList[0]; } USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION, *PUSB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION; inputBuffer/outputBuffer - pointer to buffer to be filled in with the USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION. On entry ConnectionIndex should be set to the desired zero based index value of the port or interface to request information about. length - size of buffer passed in by user mode application   needs to be long enough to hold the list of all open pipes on the connection. In addition to basic information about the device a list of USB pipes opened by the device and their characteristics is provided so that the caller may determine how much bandwidth is being consumed by this device. IOCTL_USB_GET_DESCRIPTOR_FROM_NODE_CONNECTION typedef struct _USB_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST {     ULONG ConnectionIndex;     struct {         UCHAR bmRequest;         UCHAR bRequest;         USHORT wValue;         USHORT wIndex;         USHORT wLength;     } SetupPacket;     UCHAR Data[0]; } USB_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST, *PUSB_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST; inputBuffer/outputBuiffer - pointer to a buffer containing a USB_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST.  On entry SetupPacket is filled in with the appropriate values for a particular GET_DESCRIPTOR request.  On exit the Data[] is filled in with the data returned by the device.   This api provides a generic mechanism for a user mode app to request a descriptor from a device in order to display additional descriptive information. INTERNAL IOCTLS:  IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_SUBMIT_URB     This IOCTL is used by client drivers to submit URB (USB Request Blocks)    Parameters.Others.Argument1 = pointer to URB  IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_RESET_PORT  This IOCTL will generate a USB reset on the port associated with the PDO passed to IoCallDriver.  After reset, the device is in the addressed, unconfigured state.  It is up to the driver to restore the device to the same state as before the reset.  This IOCTL allows a device driver to re-initialize its  device without invoking plug and play.                                                  IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_GET_PORT_STATUS     This IOCTL returns the current port status for the port associated with the PDO passed to IoCallDriver .     Parameters.Others.Argument1 = pointer to port status register (ULONG)     status bits are: #define  USBD_PORT_ENABLED      0x00000001 #define  USBD_PORT_CONNECTED    0x00000002  IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_ENABLE_PORT     This IOCTL will request the hub to re-enable the  port associated with the PDO passed to IoCalldriver. This IOCTL is allows a device driver to re-enable a port that has been disabled due to a babble error generated by the attached device.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6Microsoft Windows 9xWindows 9x jdunn normal.dot jdunn Microsoft Word for Windows 95Windows 9x Host Controller Driver Interface (HCDI) Specification  rev .01 IRP/URB interface IRP functions supported An HCD supports the following IRP major functions.  IRP_MJ_CREATE Called when USBD attaches to the HCD. IRP_MJ_CLOSE Called when USBD detaches from the HCD. IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL  This function is used by USBD  to submit URBs to USBD.  The parameter format expected for this function is: _IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.Others.Argument1 = pointer to USB_REQUEST_BLOCK. **We may want to define IRP_MJ_SUBMIT_URB equivalent to IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL, like scsi does. HCD handles URBs passed in by USBD (the class driver) -- see the USBDI specification for a detailed description of URBs.  In some cases these URBs may be the original URBs submitted by a client driver to USBD with possibly some parameters modified by USBD. Errors USBD defines a set of private USB_STATUS_XXX values.  HCD must set the status field of a URB upon completion of the IRP containing the URB to one of these codes.  If the HCD returns STATUS_PENDING for the IRP for later completion HCD must set the status field to USBD_BUSY. HCD normally completes IRPs with STATUS_SUCCESS even if the URB status field is not success   USBD will map the URB status code to an appropriate NT status code in the IRP before completing it to the client driver. See the USBDI specification for a list of the USBD status codes: Bandwidth Allocation Bandwidth Accounts For a detailed description of bandwidth accounts see the USBDI specification.   HC Driver Interface APIs some definitions: URB - USB request block, data structure that describes a specific api request. HCD - Host controller driver, device driver that talks directly to USB hardware on the host. USBD - Universal Serial Bus driver, provides the interface layer (USBDI) for USB device drivers. HCDs  handle URBs in the same way that the USBD driver handles them.  A HCD will be required to support a subset of the URB commands supported by USBD and a few additional URB (HCD specific) commands.  URBs will always be passed to an HCD by USBD   it is the USBDs responsibility to perform parameter validation and error mapping.  The URBs passed to an HCD will be either passed along from a client driver or created by USBD as the result of  another URB request made to USBD. General APIs HCD_OPEN_ENDPOINT HCD_CLOSE_ENDPOINT HCD_OPEN_ACCOUNT HCD_CLOSE_ACCOUNT CONTROL_TRANSFER INTERRUPT_TRANSFER BULK_TRANSFER ISOCHRONOUS_TRANSFER SET_FRAME_LENGTH GET_FRAME_LENGTH GET_CURRENT_FRAME_NUMBER HCD_OPEN_ENDPOINT  description Creates an endpoint (including allocating bandwidth) with characteristics specified by a USB endpoint descriptor.

DeviceAddress Device address for the device this endpoint is on. AccountHandle Account to draw bandwidth from when opening this endpoint. EndpointDescriptor Pointer to a USB defined endpoint descriptor for the endpoint to open, this descriptor will provide the information HCD needs to know about the endpoint. output HcdEndpoint HCD handle for this endpoint if successful. HCD_CLOSE_ENDPOINT description Closes an endpoint structure and frees its bandwidth   the bandwidth was allocated from an account it is returned to that account.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6Microsoft Corporation CreateInterruptAccount CreateInterruptAccount  JDUNN Normal.dot jdunn Microsoft Word for Windows 95Windows 9x Universal Serial Bus Driver Interface (USBDI) Specification IRP/URB interface IRP functions supported USBD supports the following IRP major functions.  IRP_MJ_CREATE Called when USB class drivers attach themselves to USBD. IRP_MJ_CLOSE Called when USB class drivers detach themselves from USBD. IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL  USBD supports the following Internal DeviceIoControl codes: USBD_IOCTL_SUBMIT_URB This function is used by USB device class drivers to submit URBs to USBD.  The parameter format expected for this function is: _IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.Others.Argument1 = pointer to USB_REQUEST_BLOCK. Requests are passed to USBD via a pointer to a URB structure, a function code within the URB identifies the specific request. There is a separate URB structure for each function, however, every URB has a common header which contains the following fields: Length Function Code DeviceHandlerObject Status Code URB Header Structure: typedef struct {     USHORT Length;     USHORT Function;     ULONG Status;     PVOID DeviceHandlerObject;  } URB_HEADER; URB Header Parameters The header portion of a URB must always be initialized with the following input parameters and will always return the following output parameters: input Length Length of this URB structure. Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_XXX. DeviceHandlerObject The device handler object for this USB device. output Status USB_STATUS_XXX status code for the given request. Errors USBD defines a specific set of private USB_STATUS_XXX values which are returned from calls to  IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL in the status field of the URB.  The status field in the IRP is always set to a valid NTSTATUS code. USBD will map the URB status code to a valid NTSTATUS code and set the status field in  IRP request  to the NTSTATUS code when it completes the IRP.  The following is a list of  the private USB status codes: Bandwidth Allocation Bandwidth Accounts USB Driver Interface APIs General APIs Create_InterrUpt_Account Create_Isochronous_Account Close_Account Open_Interface Close_Interface Open_Endpoint Close_Endpoint Cancel_Endpoint  Take_Frame_Length_Control Release_Frame_Length_Control Get_Frame_Length Set_Frame_Length Get_Current_Frame_Number Transfer APIs Standard_Control_Transfer General_Control_Transfer Bulk_Transfer  Interrupt_Transfer Isochronous_Transfer Create_Interrupt_Account  description Creates an account from which interrupt endpoints can allocate bandwidth when they are opened, the account reserves bandwidth according to the maximum packet size and service interval passed in.  Once allocated the bandwidth can be claimed by passing in the returned AccountHandle when using the OPEN_ENDPOINT or OPEN_INTERFACE functions. URB request format typedef struct {     URB_HEADER UrbHeader;     ULONG ServiceInterval;      ULONG MaximumPacketSize;     PVOID AccountHandle; } URB_CREATE_INTERRUPT_ACCOUNT;  parameters input UrbHeader.Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_Create_InterrpUPt_Account. MaximumPacketSize Maximum packet size in bytes. ServiceInterval Polling period in ms. output AccountHandle A valid account handle if status == USB_STATUS_SUCCESS, 0 if failure; Create_Isochronous_Account description Creates an account from which USBD can allocate bandwidth when an isochronous endpoint is opened.

If the bandwidth released is in use by one or more    endpoints then it will be made available as soon as those pipes are closed.  URB request format typedef struct {     URB_HEADER UrbHeader;     PVOID AccountHandle; } URB_CLOSE_ACCOUNT parameters input UrbHeader.Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_CLOSE_ACCOUNT. AccountHandle A valid bandwidth account handle.  output Open_Interface description Open a specific interface for a USB device, the device must have previously been configured by calls to both SET_CONFIGURATION and SET_INTERFACE.  If successful a list of  open endpoints for this device is returned.  This function succeeds only if all endpoints for the requested interface can be opened.  Bandwidth reserved in either an interrupt or isochronous account can not be used when opening endpoints with this function,  instead the driver must  call OPEN_ENDPOINT separately for each endpoint in the interface.  This function only succeeds if all the endpoints in the interface can be opened. request format typedef struct {     ULONG EndpointAddress;     PVOID EndpointHandle; } ENDPOINT_INFORMATION; typedef struct {     URB_HEADER UrbHeader;     ULONG InterfaceNumber;     PVOID InterfaceHandle;      ULONG EndpointCount;     ENDPOINT_INFORMATION EndpointList[1]; } URB_OPEN_INTERFACE;  parameters input UrbHeader.Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_OPEN_INTERFACE.

InterfaceHandle The interface handle from a previous call to OPEN_INTERFACE. output Open_Endpoint description This function will attempt to open the specified endpoint. If a bandwidth account is specified the bandwidth necessary is allocated from this account.  If there is insufficient bandwidth in the account to open the endpoint an attempt is made to get the bandwidth necessary, if this succeeds then the bandwidth allocated is associated with the account (i.e. it is returned to this account when the endpoint closes). request format typedef struct {     URB_HEADER UrbHeader;     ULONG EndpointAddress;      PVOID EndpointHandle;     PVOID AccountHandle; } URB_OPEN_ENDPOINT; parameters input UrbHeader.Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_Open_Endpoint.

Output FrameNumber The current 32-bit frame number. Standard_Control_Transfer description This request is used to send standard commands (defined in Chapter 9 of the USB specification) to a device on the default pipe.  The standard commands are: GET_CONFIGURATION SET_CONFIGURATION GET_DESCRIPTOR SET_IDLE GET_INTERFACE SET_INTERFACE GET_MAX_PACKET SET_MAX_PACKET GET_ADDRESS SET_ADDRESS GET_STATUS SET_STATUS SET_REMOTE_WAKEUP JD: we need to clarify if the status phase of a control transfer can return data. Vendor and class specific commands are sent through this interface as well, it is up to the device driver to format the setup  packet properly for these commands.  This interface will be the only way to send commands on the default pipe. Standard Command Notes SET_CONFIGURATION This command will be failed by USBD if any interfaces or endpoints on the device are open. SET_INTERFACE (really should be called SET_ALT_INTERFACE) This command will be failed by USBD if the another alternate of the given interface is open or if any endpoints for the requested (new) interface are open.

There are two types of  accounts, isochronous and interrupt.   Isochronous Accounts Isochronous bandwidth is calculated based on the number of bit-times needed to support a given maximum packet size.  When an isochronous account is created the caller indicates a maximum packet size for a hypothetical endpoint (i.e. an endpoint of these characteristics does not have to exist on the device)   the bandwidth to support an endpoint of this configuration is allocated and associated with the account handle that is returned.  Later when the client opens an isochronous endpoint it has the option of drawing the bandwidth needed from this account, it indicates this by passing the valid account handle to the OPEN_ENDPOINT function.  When the endpoint is later closed, any bandwidth allocated from an account is returned to that account.   Interrupt Accounts Interrupt endpoints are more complex since the bandwidth required to support an endpoint depends on the polling interval.  An interrupt endpoint can occupy one of XXX possible positions in the schedule based on the polling interval   the bandwidth used by the endpoint will depend on the position USBD allocates to this endpoint as well as the maximum packet size.  USBD attempts to balance the load (bandwidth used by interrupt endpoints) across the XXX possible positions in schedule.  Because of this, when a bandwidth account is created for an interrupt endpoint both the polling interval and the maximum packet size are specified  so that a position in the schedule can be assigned to the account.  Once allocated an interrupt  bandwidth account can support any interrupt endpoint of <= the requested polling interval and <= the maximum packet.  Example: <Picture Here> Specifies the size (in bytes)the specific _XXXrequest structureN  (N is calculated by rounding down the requested polling interval to the nearest power of 2 d less than or equal to 32)  theNit can occupy in theWhen an endpoint is opened using bandwidth from an interrupt account the position in the schedule for the interrupt endpoint is taken from the account.  As with isochronous endpoints when the interrupt endpoint is closed any bandwidth (and schedule position) is returned to the account from which it was drawn.

Changes may be made to any part of the document, especially at the details level.  The USB Driver Interface (USBDI) is part of the Win32  Driver Model (WDM) layered architecture for the Microsoft  Windows  and Windows  operating systems. USBDI is the interface offered to client drivers by the operating system USB driver stack. Part of the WDM architecture is shown in Figure 1, with the USBDI highlighted. USBDI is an IRP-based interface; individual requests are packaged within a WDM I/O request packet (IRP) and are passed to the device object of the next driver in the stack   the device object is returned from the client driver's call to IoAttachDeviceToStack Figure 1. A portion of the WDM layered architecture, with the USB driver interface highlighted. The following modules are shown in Figure 1. HIDCLASS.SYS is the HID class driver. It sends and receives HID reports to and from its minidrivers. HIDUSB.SYS is the HID device driver. It sends and receives HID reports over the USB bus. USBHUB.SYS is the USB hub driver. It is loaded if the PCI enumerator detects a USB hub. USBD.SYS is the USB class driver. UHCB.SYS and OHCB.SYS are USB host controller drivers. (OHCB.SYS for the Open Host Controller Interface or UHCB.SYS for the Universal Host Controller Interface) PCI Enumerator takes care of loading the USB stack driver components when a USB bus is detected on a platform and always loads at least the other core components. Overview A WDM USB device driver communicates with a WDM USB stack through an IRP interface. There are two ways to call DDIs: The client device driver passes USB request block (URB) structures to the next-lower driver as a parameter in an IRP with Irp->MajorFunction set to IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL and the next IRP stack location Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode field set to IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_SUBMIT_URB.  The client device driver passes an IRP with Irp->Majorfunction set to IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL, and the next IRP stack location Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode field set to one of the IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_ other function codes.  The client device driver and bus driver share information in the common structures USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION and USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION. I/O Request Packet Transfers IRPs are passed to the next lower driver by using the WDM function IoCallDriver with the device object of the next lower driver as a parameter.The device object of the next lower driver for all USB client device drivers is the DeviceObject returned from the call to IoAttachDeviceToStack. (For more information, see WDM Design Notes and Reference, which is another of the documents supplied with this DDK.) IOCTL Codes USB client device drivers must use the IOCTL codes listed in the following table for IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL. The parameter format expected for this function is: IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.Others.Argument1 = pointer to USB request block. IRP Major Function Description IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_SUBMIT_URB Used by USB client device drivers to submit URBs to the USB stack. IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_RESET_PORT Details to be provided in a later draft. IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_ENUMERATE Used to retrieve a list of all devices on the bus. IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_GET_ROOTHUB_PDO Details to be provided in a later draft. USB Request Block (URB) Transfers Clients send these requests to the bus by including them in an IRP pointer to a URB structure; a function code within the URB identifies the specific request.  For transfer requests, multiple URB structures may be linked and passed in with a single IRP. The USB driver stack components assume all URB structures passed to them are allocated from the nonpaged pool. Common URB Header Structure Different URB structures are defined for each function. However, every URB has a common header, which is defined below. The header portion of a URB must always be initialized with the input parameters Length and Function, and will always return the output parameter Status. struct _URB_HEADER { USHORT Length; USHORT Function; USBD_STATUS Status; PVOID UsbdDeviceHandle;  ULONG UsbdFlags; Length Specifies the size (in bytes) of the specific URB_XXX request structure. Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_XXX, where XXX refers to USB device driver provided functions. Status USB_STATUS_XXX status code for the given request. For more information, see  Status Codes  in the URB Transfer Requests section. UsbdDeviceHandle This field is reserved for operating system USB stack use. UsbdFlags This field is reserved for operating system USB stack use.  Bandwidth Allocation Bandwidth allocation occurs through the process of selecting a configuration or interface and acquiring open pipe handles. While a driver holds an open handle for a specific pipe, the bandwidth necessary to transfer data on that pipe (based on maximum packet size and service interval) is reserved. URB Transfer Requests This section describes the following aspects of URB transfer requests: transfer flags, status codes, halt/stall behavior, and linked URBs.  Transfer Flags The TransferFlags parameter of the URB is used to control certain options of a transfer and to indicate direction. The following flags are defined: Transfer Flag Value Description USBD_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK This bit is used only when the USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN bit is set.  When a packet is received from a device that is shorter than MaxPacket for the endpoint and does not exactly fill the buffer (unless USBD_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK is set) the transfer will be terminated with an error. For control endpoints, if a short transfer occurs and USB_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK is set, then the HCD will immediately proceed to the status phase of the command; otherwise, the error is reported and neither the status phase nor the remainder of the data phase will be run. USBD_START_ISO_TRANSFER_ASAP For more information, see the reference section that describes the URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_TRANSFER request. USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN This bit is set if the data payload direction is device-to-host. This bit needs to be set by the client drivers only when issuing a control transfer for the nondefault pipe. The proper value will be set by USBD for all other transfer requests, including control transfer requests on the default pipe. Status Codes Usbdi.h defines a set of private USB_STATUS_XXX values that are returned from calls to IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL in the status field of the URB. The status field in the IRP is always set to a valid NTSTATUS code. USBD maps the URB status code to a valid NTSTATUS code and sets the status field in the IRP to the NTSTATUS code when it completes the IRP. This way, a USB client device driver does not need to perform mapping of USB error codes unless it wishes to. See Usbdi.h for a list of these. Halt/Stall Behavior In this document, a host-side stall, the condition where current transfers for a pipe are halted and new transfers are rejected by the software stack, is referred to as PIPE HALTED. When an error occurs during a transfer (for example, a time-out or a stall PID returned), the HCD immediately completes all the URBs associated with the IRP request on which the error condition occurred, with USBD_STATUS_PIPE_ABORTED. The pipe is set to the halted state, and no further transfers can be submitted to the pipe associated with this endpoint. If any additional requests are queued for this pipe, they will remain queued (these transfers will not be completed).  When the USB driver issues the URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE request for the halted pipe, transfers to the associated pipe will resume with the next queued URB. Halt behavior on the default control pipe. Since devices are required to always accept a setup packet on the control pipe, the USB stack implements an autoclearing mechanism for the halt condition on this pipe. Because of this, the control pipe will never enter the HALTED state and the client driver need not take any special action to clear the condition when an error occurs. Halt behavior on isochronous pipes. Because of the nature of isochronous data transfers, these pipes will never enter the halted state. Linked URBs Information describing rules for linking multiple URBs in a single IRP request will be included in a future draft. Common Data Structures For information about the common data structures USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION and USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION, see the Common Structure Reference topic. See the URB Request Reference topic for information about the URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE and URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION requests. Reference USB Device Driver-Provided Functions The USBDI provides three different types of functions to a client USB device driver: Default pipe functions General-purpose functions Transfer functions The functions within each category that are defined in this document are listed in the following tables. Summary List of Default Pipe Requests Function Description URB_FUNCTION_CLEAR_FEATURE_XXX Enables a client to send the USB command Clear Feature. XXX is TO_DEVICE, TO_INTERFACE, TO_ENDPOINT or TO_OTHER. URB_FUNCTION_GET_DESCRIPTOR_XXX Enables a client to use the USB command Get Descriptor to retrieve USB descriptors on a particular device. XXX is FROM_DEVICE or FROM_ENDPOINT. URB_FUNCTION_GET_STATUS_XXX Enables a client to send the USB Get Status command on the default pipe. XXX is FROM_DEVICE, FROM_INTERFACE, FROM_ENDPOINT, or FROM_OTHER. URB_FUNCTION_SET_DESCRIPTOR_XXX Enables a client to use the USB command SetDescriptor to set USB descriptors on a particular device. XXX is TO_DEVICE or TO_ENDPOINT. URB_FUNCTION_SET_FEATURE_XXX Enables a client to send the USB command Set Feature. XXX is TO_DEVICE, TO_INTERFACE, TO_ENDPOINT, or TO_ OTHER. URB_FUNCTION_SYNC_FRAME Enables a client to send the USB command Synch Frame. URB_FUNCTION_VENDOR_OR_CLASS_XXX Enables a client to send vendor-specific and dlass-specific commands on the default pipe. XXX is DEVICE, INTERFACE, ENDPOINT, or OTHER. Summary List of General Purpose Requests Function Description URB_FUNCTION_ABORT_PIPE Enables a client to cancel any pending transfers for the specified pipe. State and endpoint state are unaffected. URB_FUNCTION_GET_CURRENT _FRAME_NUMBER Enables a client to retrieve the current 32-bit frame number. URB_FUNCTION_GET_FRAME_LENGTH Enables a client to determine the number of bit times in a USB frame and the frame number at or after which the number of bit times can be changed. URB_FUNCTION_RELEASE_FRAME _LENGTH_CONTROL Enables a client to release control of the frame length for the client s bus if the client currently holds the ability to set the frame length. URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE Enables a client to clear the stalled state of a pipe within the USB stack. Transfers will resume with the next URB queued for the endpoint. URB_FUNCTION_SELECT _CONFIGURATION Enables a client to open a specific configuration for a USB device. URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE Enables a client to open a specific alternate interface for a USB device; the device must have been previously configured by a call to URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION. Policy information is specified for each pipe in the interface, and an open handle is returned for each pipe in the interface. URB_FUNCTION_SET_FRAME_LENGTH Enables a client to adjust the number of bit times in the USB frame. The client must have successfully taken control of the frame length (by calling URB_FUNCTION_TAKE_FRAME_LENGTH_CONTROL). URB_FUNCTION_TAKE_FRAME _LENGTH_CONTROL Gives a client the ability to change the USB frame length for the bus the client s device is on. After a successful URB_FUNCTION_TAKE_FRAME_LENGTH_CONTROL call, a client can call URB_FUNCTION_SET_FRAME_LENGTH. No other client on the same bus can change the frame length until this client releases control by calling URB_FUNCTION_RELEASE_FRAME_LENGTH_CONTROL. Summary List of Transfer Requests Function Description URB_FUNCTION_CONTROL_TRANSFER Enables a client to submit general control transfers to a (nondefault) control pipe. URB_FUNCTION_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT _TRANSFER Enables a client to submit bulk or interrupt transfers to a specific pipe. URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_TRANSFER Enables a client to submit isochronous transfers to a specific isochronous pipe.

Index Index value for the setup packet. (See Chapter 9 of the USB Specification, Revision 1.0.) URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_TRANSFER This transfer request enables a client to submit isochronous transfers to a specific pipe. typedef struct _USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR {    ULONG  Offset;    ULONG  Length;    USBD_STATUS  Status; } USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR, *PUSBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR; struct _URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER {    struct _URB_HEADER;    USBD_PIPE_HANDLE  PipeHandle;    ULONG  TransferFlags;    ULONG  TransferBufferLength;    PVOID  TransferBuffer;    PMDL  TransferBufferMDL;    ULONG  ReservedMBZ;    struct _URB_HCD_AREA hca;    ULONG  StartFrame;    ULONG  NumberOfPackets;    ULONG  ErrorCount;    USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR IsoPacket[0]; Members: Function Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_Transfer. #define URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_TRANSFER                  0x000A PipeHandle  The pipe handle to an isochronous pipe. TransferFlags To be provided in a future draft. TransferBufferLength  Length of input/output buffer in bytes. TransferBuffer  Input/output buffer pointer. If the TransferBufferMDL parameter is NULL, the buffer is assumed to be locked system memory allocated from the nonpaged pool. TransferBufferMDL  Optional MDL that describes the input/output buffer. TransferFlags  Option flags for this transfer. For HCD use. StartFrame  Starting frame number. NumberOfPackets  Number of packets to transfer. ErrorCount  Number of packets that completed with errors. Packet  Unbounded array of packet descriptors. Output: USB status code. If !=USB_STATUS_SUCCESS, then per-packet status information is available in the IsoPacket array. Notes: The client specifies a transmission buffer, an array of packet offsets, and a starting frame number. On completion the status per packet is returned in the IsoPacket array. The START_ISO_TRANSFER_ASAP flag may be specified in the TransferFlags field for isochronous transfers. If this flag is set and no transfers have been submitted for the pipe since it was opened or reset, then the transfer will begin on the next frame and StartFrame will be updated with the frame number the transfer was actually started on. If this flag is set and the pipe has active transfers, then the transfer will be queued to begin on the frame after the last queued transfer is completed. For OUT transfers, the length field in the ISO_PACKET_FIELD is not used; the length of the packet is calculated from the difference in offset values of consecutive packets. For IN transfers, the length field is updated with the actual number of bytes returned. If the length is less than the difference between the offset of the current packet and the next packet, then a gap will be left in the input buffer. The URB for an isochronous transfer will only be completed with an error if every packet in the transfer generated an error; otherwise, the URB status will be success and ErrorCount will contain the number of packets that generated errors. The TransferBuffer or TransferBufferMDL must specify a virtually contiguous buffer. The offsets in the packet descriptor represent offsets into this buffer. Errors: NOT_ACCESSED Returned for each packet that was submitted too late for the packet to be sent, based on the requested start frame. Returned for the requests if no packets could be sent. ISOCH_REQUEST_FAILED Returned when all the packets of an isochronous request are completed with errors. BAD_START_FRAME Returned if the requested start frame is not within USBD_ISO_START_FRAME_RANGE of the current USB frame. URB_FUNCTION_RELEASE_FRAME_LENGTH_CONTROL This general-purpose request enables a client to release control of the frame length for the client s bus if the client currently holds the ability to set the frame length. struct _URB_Frame_Length_Control {     struct  _URB_HEADER; Members: Function  Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_Release_Frame_Length_Control. #define URB_FUNCTION_RELEASE_FRAME_LENGTH_CONTROL    0x0004 URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE This general-purpose request enables a client to clear the halted state of a pipe within the USB stack.  It does not reset the stalled state of the endpoint on the device; the device driver must accomplish this by sending the appropriate FEATURE request on the default pipe. Transfers will resume with the next URB queued for the endpoint. struct _URB_PIPE_REQUEST{     struct _URB_HEADER;     USBD_PIPE_HANDLE  PipeHandle; Members: Function  Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE. #define URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE                      0x001E PipeHandle The pipe handle from a previous call to URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION or URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE.

Open all pipes within the specified interfaces (with policy information passed in the PipeFlags and MaximimTransferSize fields) and set the pipes to the active state. If any pipe cannot be opened, then the entire request is failed. Once this request is successfully completed, the device is considered to be in the configured state. Errors: NO _BANDWIDTH Returned if there is insufficient bandwidth available to open all pipes in the configuration with the requested settings. URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE This general-purpose request enables a client to open a specific alternate interface for a USB device; the device must have previously been configured by a call to URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION. Policy information is specified for each pipe in the interface, and an open handle is returned for each pipe in the interface. struct _URB_SELECT_INTERFACE {     struct  _URB_HEADER;     USBD_CONFIGURATION_HANDLE  ConfigurationHandle;     USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION  Interface; Members: Function  Function code set to URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE. #define URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE                0x0001 ConfigurationHandle  Configuration handle returned from SELECT_CONFIGURATION.

UrbLink  Optional link to the next URB request. Used if this is a chain of requests. For HCD use. RequestTypeReservedBits  The setup packet for vendor/class requests is built by USBD. This field is provided so the driver may pass additional bits in the bmRequestType field of the setup packet that are not defined by the USB specification, but may be defined by a particular device class. (For more information, see Chapter 9 of the Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 1.0.) Request  Vendor or class defined. Value  Vendor or class defined. Index  Vendor or class defined. Note: For vendor-specific and class-specific commands, the setup packet is constructed based on input parameters in the URB. The function code specifies the recipient (DEVICE, INTERFACE, ENDPOINT, or OTHER). Direction is indicated through the TransferDirection field, and data buffer length is specified by the TransferBufferLength field. USBD Services Reference The USBD driver exports several services to assist client drivers in setting up URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION and URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_INTERFACE requests. See Usbdilib.h for prototypes. The USBD driver-provided services are: CreateConfigurationRequestEx GetUSBDIVersion ParseConfiguration DescriptorEx USBD_CreateConfigurationRequestEx This service allocates and initializes a URB of appropriate size to configure a device based on the list of interfaces passed in. The interface list is a contiguous array of USBD_INTERFACE_LIST_ENTRIES, each pointing to a specific interface descriptor to be incorporated in the request. The list is terminated by a list entry with an InterfaceDescriptor pointer of NULL. On return, the interface field of each list entry is filled in with a pointer to the USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION structure within the URB corresponding to the same interface descriptor. USBD_CreateConfigurationRequestEx(     IN PUSB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR  ConfigurationDescriptor,     IN PUSBD_INTERFACE_LIST_ENTRY  InterfaceList     ); Members: ConfigurationDescriptor  Pointer to USB configuration descriptor, returned from a device (including all interface and endpoint descriptors). InterfaceList List of interfaces we are interested in. USBD_GetUSBDIVersion This service, given a pointer to a VersionInformation structure, fills the fields that hold the USBDI version and the supported USBDI version. USBD_GetUSBDIVersion(     PUSBD_VERSION_INFORMATION  VersionInformation     ); Members: VersionInformation  Pointer to a VersionInformation structure. VersionInformation.USBDI_Version  To be provided in a future draft. VersionInformation.Supported_USB_Version  To be provided in a future draft. USBD_ParseDescriptors Parses a group of standard USB configuration descriptors (returned from a device) for a specific descriptor type. PUSB_COMMON_DESCRIPTOR USBD_ParseDescriptors(     IN PVOID DescriptorBuffer,     IN ULONG TotalLength,     IN PVOID StartPosition,     IN LONG DescriptorType     ); Parameters: DescriptorBuffer Pointer to a block of contiguous USB desscriptors TotalLength Size in bytes of the Descriptor buffer StartPosition Starting position in the buffer to begin parsing, this must point to the begining of a USB descriptor. DescriptorType USB descritor type to locate. Return Value: Returns a pointer to a USB descriptor with a DescriptorType field matching the input parameter or NULL if not found. USBD_ParseConfigurationDescriptorEx This service parses a standard USB configuration descriptor (returned from a device) for a specific interface, alternate setting, class, subclass, or protocol code. PUSB_INTERFACE_DESCRIPTOR USBD_ParseConfigurationDescriptor(     IN PUSB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR  ConfigurationDescriptor,      IN PVOID  StartPosition,     IN LONG  InterfaceNumber,     IN LONG  AlternateSetting,     IN LONG  InterfaceClass,     IN LONG  InterfaceSubClass,     IN LONG  InterfaceProtocol Parameters: ConfigurationDescriptor  Pointer to a USB configuration descriptor, returned from a device (includes all interface and endpoint descriptors). StartPosition Pointer to starting position within the configuration descriptor to begin parsing; this must be a valid USB descriptor. InterfaceNumber  Number to locate, (-1) match any. AlternateSetting  Alternate setting to locate, (-1) match any. InterfaceClass Class to find, (-1) match any. InterfaceSubClass Subclass to find, (-1) match any. InterfaceProtocol Protocol to find, (-1) match any. Return Value: This function will return a pointer to the requested interface if found; otherwise, NULL is returned. USBD_GetInterfaceLength Returns the length (in bytes) of a given interface descriptor including all endpoint and class descriptors. ULONG USBD_GetInterfaceLength(     IN PUSB_INTERFACE_DESCRIPTOR InterfaceDescriptor,      IN PUCHAR BufferEnd     ); Parameters: InterfaceDescriptor To be provided in a future draft. BufferEnd Pointer to the end of the buffer containing the descriptors. Return Value: Length of descriptors. GET_SELECT_CONFIGURATION_REQUEST_SIZE This macro will calculate the appropriate size of a USB select configuration URB request based on the total number of interfaces and pipes in all the interfaces selected. GET_SELECT_CONFIGURATION_REQUEST_SIZE(totalInterfaces, totalPipes); Parameters: TotalInterfaces  Total number of interfaces in the configuration. TotalPipes  Total number of pipes in the configuration. Return Value: The size of the SELECT_CONFIGURATION structure needed for this request is returned. GET_SELECT_INTERFACE_REQUEST_SIZE This macro will calculate the appropriate size of a USB select interface URB request based on the total number of pipes in the alternate interface selected. GET_SELECT_INTERFACE_REQUEST_SIZE(totalPipes); Parameters: TotalPipes  Total number of pipes in the configuration. Return Value: The size of the SELECT_INTERFACE structure needed for this request is returned. GET_USBD_INTERFACE_SIZE This macro will calculate the size of a USB interface information structure needed to describe a given interface, based on the number of endpoints. GET_USBD_INTERFACE_SIZE(numEndpoints); Parameters: numEndpoints Total number of endpoints. Return Value: The size of the USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION structure needed for this request is returned. GET_ISO_URB_SIZE This macro will calculate the size of an ISO URB request, given the number of packets. GET_ISO_URB_SIZE(n); Parameters: Number of packets. Return Value: The size of the USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR structure.  STYLEREF Ch \* MERGEFORMAT  USB Driver and Minidriver Design Notes and Reference  PAGE  Microsoft Confidential Draft.

It allows users to set and retrieve DNs in different formats. It is inherited from the IDispatch interface and will support Visual Basic. IADsNameTranslate is an interface on a "NameTranslate" object, that needs to be explictly instantiated before using the interface. It does not live off a normal IADs Directory Object. For example, in order to use the object in C++, CoCreateInstance() has to be called. To use the object in VB, the user has to explictly   the object. The IID for the interface is IID_IADsNameTranslate.

ADsPath SYNTAX
-----------

    ADsPath ::= "ADs" ":" ["//"]
        | Namespace ":" 
        | Namespace "://" ProviderPath
        ;

    Namespace ::= NonEscapedName
        ;
        
    ProviderPath ::= Component
        | Component '/' ProviderPath
        ;

    Component ::= EscapedName
        ;
        
    NonEscapedName ::= ( StringChar)*

    EscapedName ::= ( StringChar | Pair )*
        | '"' ( StringChar | SpecialChars | Pair ) * '"'

    StringChar ::= AllChars - (SpecialChars | '\' | '"')

    Pair ::= "\" ( SpecialChars | '\' | '"' ) 
    
    SpecialChars = '/' | ',' | '<' | '>'


NOTE:

1. Note that the above is a necessary but may not be a sufficient syntactic 
   specification for the ProviderPath. Providers may impose further quoting or 
   escaping rules without violating the above syntax.
   
2. When an entire ADsPath is written in a different context
   as part of another string (for eg., in URLs or search specifications) 
   there is a need to delimit the entire ADsPath. It is recommended that '<' 
   and '>' be used for that purpose. 
   

NOTES FOR THE LDAP Provider:
   
1. the LDAP provider in ADSI defines the syntax of the ProviderPath
   as follows. 
   

    LdapProviderPath ::= [LdapServerName '/'] LdapDN
        ;
        
    LdapDN ::= ADsDN | X500DN
    
    ADsDN ::= LastComponent
        | Component '/' ProviderPath
        ;
        
    X500DN ::= LastComponent
        | Component ',' ProviderPath
        | Component ';' ProviderPath
        ;
        
    LastComponent ::= FullComponent ',' ClassSpecifier
        | Component
        ;
        
    FullComponent ::= ClassSpecifier '=' Component
        
    Component ::= EscapedName
        ;
        
    ClassSpecifier ::= <non x500 name>
        ;

    EscapedName ::= ( StringChar | Pair )*
        | '"' ( StringChar | SpecialChars | Pair ) * '"'

    StringChar ::= AllChars - (SpecialChars | '\' | '"')

    Pair ::= "\" ( SpecialChars | '\' | '"' ) 
    
    SpecialChars = '/' | ',' | '<' | '>' | ';' | '='

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6Please also note the rest of the mail belowPlease also note the rest of the mail below Ram Viswanathan getobj.doc Ram Viswanathan Microsoft Word for Windows 95Accessing OLE DS objects  in the  Windows NT Provider OLEDS supports a container based hierarchical  architecture. We support an OLEDS naming convention according to which  each object is identified by  <OLEDS path> ::= <NameSpace ProgId>:// provider specific path. For an object in an NDS tree we can simply use  something like  NDS://MARSDEV,O=MS,OU=USERS,CN=Ramv, A path such as the above uniquely identifies a way of accessing the actual object. However in NT we don t really have an unambiguous hierarchical naming convention. For the purposes of OLEDS we  support a path such as WinNT:// a/b/c where   a   can be a domain or computer or workgroup. Now a  domain can contain computer, users and groups  and a computer can contain users, groups, printers,  services and fileservices. A fileservice can contain fileshares. A workgroup can contain computers only.                                                                                               Therefore in order to validate an object, it is necessary to validate every single  component along its path. Given an OLEDS path in the WinNT namespace it is not possible to say what kind of object it really is.  We need to validate each component on the object s path.  Validating each component is a relatively expensive operation.  If for example, it is necessary to validate an object as a domain, we need to  do a NetGetDCName  which searches for the Domain Controller of the Domain.  Likewise validating a Computer object needs to do a NetWkstaGetInfo. Validating a Workgroup  requires one to do a NetServerEnum which will enumerate all computers in the Workgroup, Depending on whether or not an object is returned, we decide if it is a valid Workgroup or not.  All the above calls mentioned above are network calls and are time consuming especially in the failure case.  Accessing OLEDS objects  is usually fast.  Given this inherent limitation of the NT naming convention, we  do encounter certain cases (especially the failure case) which has to thread through every single possibility  before it finally returns the result that the object is not a valid and instantiable OLEDS object. The following are strategies to speed up the validation and instantiation process. Cache hits.  If it is determined that a certain object is a domain, then we cache this information along with the  name of the Primary Domain Controller. Likewise if we determine if a certain object is a computer or workgroup then we store that information in  our cache. Cache Misses: When a certain object is accessed and we have already tried accessing that object and we know that it does not exist. Then we fail it right away without making any net calls.  For all the above cases we need to use a time out mechanism. This is necessary because we don t want to fail or succeed a validation based on stale data.  Also please refer to the following mails that describes in detail the overhead that is associated with each validation in terms of the Net Calls made.  Appendix: Overhead associated with the validation and conclusions Good list.  some questions/suggestions: a) we should try domains first, computers second b) i thought we already cache hits for domains?  c) everytime we resolve a component [0] name (ie computer or domain), it should go into cache (with a time to live before exipring). if the cache already has max entries, the oldest should (expired entry preferred) be thrown out to make way for the new. an entry is marked as one of: domain (and associated PDC) or computer or <unknown> and is stamped with tickcount. computers & domains expire in say 180 seconds & <unknown> in 30 seconds (we can tweak later if need).  this implies a unified 'resolve component[0]' function. d) we should remove the redundant call you mentioned. be careful to test the case where entry is still in cache but is not longer avail (machinre went down).  ---------- From:  Ram Viswanathan Sent:  Tuesday, August 27, 1996 12:31 AM Chuck Chan; Krishna Ganugapati; Danilo Almeida Ram Viswanathan Subject:  OLEDS  Heuristic GetObject performance issues. This mail summarizes the overhead we incur when we access objects in the WinNT namespace. Suggestions to speed up Heuristic GetObject are at the end of this mail. No changes were made to the Heuristic Getobject code since we released the beta.  Captures were made in the network monitor for each of the cases we tried.  You can look at them in \\ramv1\captures if interested.\ All the Net Calls made in each of the  cases below is also noted. 1. Accessing a computer object  (i.e) WInNT://krishnag1  This is fast because it is the first thing we try. 2. Accessing a domain object WinNT://ntwksta This is slowed down because we try to instantiate ntwksta as a computer object first. This needs to do a NetWkstaGetInfo which tries to access a server by that name and finally fails when it receives a failure message on every transport it tries. Possible solutions : Cache the domain names/computer names. Note: Any form of caching will only work across a single session. This is because the cached information is only local to the process currently in execution. 3. Failure case: Accessing  WinNT://foo where foo is neither a domain nor a computer. Makes the Net Calls NetWkstaGetInfo which has to fail owing to the fact that there is no computer by that name. Then we do a NetGetDCName which also fails. Thus this call can be expensive. Two slow net calls. Possible solutions Cache bad names also. Have a short time out period for this. 4. Accessing a  domain/computer  Calls NetUserGetInfo  Calls NetGroupGetInfo          NetLocalGroupGetInfo          NetWkstaGetInfo 5.  Accessing a domain/group NetCalls   NetUserGetInfo   NetGroupGetInfo   NetLocalGroupGetInfo 6.  domain/user   NetUserGetInfo 7.  (workgroup cases) computer/user NetWkstaGetInfo NetUserGetInfo NetGroupGetInfo NetLocalGroupGetInfo 8. computer/group NetWkstaGetInfo NetUserGetInfo NetGroupGetInfo NetLocalGroupGetInfo NetWkstaGetInfo     (redundant call) 9. workgroup\computer NetWkstaGetInfo 10. computer/printqueue, computer/service, computer/fileservice are relatively benign calls. (as far as being time hogs is concerned).  When we have 3 components  it could be  domain\computer\user domain\computer\group domain\computer\printer domain\computer\service domain\computer\fileservice computer\fileservice\fileshare workgroup\computer\user workgroup\computer\group workgroup\computer\printer workgroup\computer\service workgroup\computer\fileservice Here we perform  one call to note if  the first component is a parent of the second and then proceed onwards.  This is relatively inexpensive irrespective of the case. Four components  there are merely two cases domain\computer\fileservice\fileshare workgroup\computer\fileservice\fileshare Not one of these cases  is expensive. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary: The above is an exhaustive list of NetCalls made under each scenario. What will help us in achieving good speed? Caching hits.              Whenever we hit an object  such as a domain object, we can cache the fact under the cache list we maintain. We also periodically age this cache to ensure that the entries are aged out every 5-10 minutes.  This same caching mechanism can be used in many scenarios. Caching misses       Suppose we find out that a certain path is invalid.  (i.e WinNT://foo/bar) then we can potentially cache this fact under an invalid object cache. This cache must also be aged since invalid paths may become valid and vice versa Eliminating redundant calls.   We have cleaned that out a fair bit in the past. We only noticed one case where there was additional NetWkstaGetInfo Important note: There is nothing we can do to improve the first time miss of any failure case. This is really sloooow.

Introduction In this document we describe the various issues associated with adding Automation Exception Information support to ADSI. In particular, we define the initial level of support provided by ADSI and we also describe the development plan. OLE Automation (or simply Automation) defines a generic mechanism through which an Automation object can pass back extended error information to the Automation controller. Specifically, the Automation object pass back this extended error information through an ExceptionInfo structure provided by the controller in IDispatch::Invoke. If an Automation object support the Automation exception mechanism, it should raise an exception by filling out the provided ExceptionInfo structure and returning DISP_E_EXCEPTION. Chapter 14 of Inside OLE by Kraig Brockschmidt has a more detail description of the Automation exception mechanism. Here, we are more interested in what this generic exception mechanism can provide while traditional error codes cannot. We can summarize the advantages of the Automation Exception mechanism over the use of error codes as follows: Generic mapping of error to an error description string that can be customized for a specific locale. Note that most Automation controller can only map a trivial subset of HRESULT s to meaningful error messages. Context-sensitive help support that can be customized for a specific locale. Run-time multilingual support for error messages and help file. Note that only exception-aware automation controllers can take advantage of the extended error information provided by an automation object. Since most popular Automation controllers, including Microsoft Visual Basic and DispTest, are exception-aware, the decision to include Automation exception support in ADSI is well justified.   Level of Exception Information Support Provided by ADSI The (initial) Automation exception support provided by ADSI will not be as ambitious as to include all the features outlined in the previous section. The main focus of ADSI Automation exception support will be on providing generic mapping of errors to error description strings customizable for a specific locale. ADSI will not support a help file in the near future and run-time multilingual error support     Development Plan In this section, we outline the development plan for adding the desired Automation exception support to ADSI. In particular, we shall identify the sub-tasks pertinent to our goal and we shall describe a preliminary strategy of approaching these tasks.  Itemized Sub-tasks (New items may be added to the following list in the future.) Create adser.rc file. (Someone else has done it already) Create adserr.mc file. (Someone else has done it already) Modify sources file to link binaries with MSG000.BIN(?) . (This may have been done already. I need to investigate further.) Implement ISupportErrorInfo.  Implement BAIL_ON_FAILURE_AND_RAISE_EXCEPTION macro. This is simply BAIL_ON_FAILURE extended to  raise  an automation exception. (This is not really needed. See current implementation.)   Implement a function that raises an Automation exception given an HRESULT. RaiseException(HRESULT hr) Implement a function that fills out an ExceptionInfo structure given an HRESULT and a pointer to an ExceptionInfo structure. HRESULT FillExceptionInfo(EXCEPTINFO *pExceptionInfo, HRESULT *phr)  Add the ISupportErrorInfo interface to all ADS dual interface implementation objects. Add code in IDispatch:Invoke after ITypeInfo:Invoke to translate ADS error code to exception. Strategy Note that we don t need to implement IErrorInfo or ICreateErrorInfo because they are for manipulating the ExceptionInfo structure only. Implementing ISupportErrorInfo is trivial but adding the ISuportErrorInfo implementation to all ADS dual interface objects may involve global changes. Specifically, we have to change the QueryInterface implementation of all dual interface objects to support ISupportErrorInfo and we have to declare the ISupportErrorInfo methods in each dual interface class. Furthermore, each dual interface class should have its own implementation of ISupportErrorInfo for its own set of supported dispatch interfaces.

Introduction Anyone who has written code for the ADSI LDAP provider probably finds that the LDAP error codes are handled in an awkward manner. Specifically, multiple LDAP error codes are mapped to the same win32 error codes in ldapc which makes precise identification of certain LDPA errors impossible. Furthermore, most of the LDAP error codes are mapped to the same E_ADS_EXTENDED_ERROR, and in order to extract more information about the error, one has to set up a call to the ADsGetLastError() function which is rather cumbersome. At the request of KrishnaG, I undertook the task of streamlining the processing of LDAP error codes in ADSI. Our goal is to establish a set of HRESULT codes that can be mapped one-to-one onto the set of LDAP error codes thus eliminating both of the aforementioned problems. Unfortunately, introducing the new set of HRESULT codes is not as straightforward as I have anticipated. Most of the changes that I have made are scattered throughout the LDAP provider and occasionally I have to identify portions of the code that require modifications based on heuristics. The procedure and heuristics that I used to streamline LDAP error code processing in ADSI are described in detail in the next section. I hope that other members of the ADSI development team can spend some time reviewing this document and let me know if are any flaws in the procedure I used. Also included in this document are issues associated with the introduction of the new error codes that may affect those who work with the LDAP provider. In particular, I shall describe the naming conventions used for these new HRESULT codes and how to translate an LDAP error code into one of the new HRESULT codes.  Streamlining LDAP Error Code Handling Definition of the LDAP HRESULT Codes The LDAP HRESULT codes are temporarily defined in oleds\errmsg\adserr.mc. Source files that need the definition of these error codes should include the adserr.h file generated from adserr.mc. Note that the adserr.h file in sdk\inc does not currently include the LDAP HRESULT codes so the either the sources file or the precompiled header in both the ldap and the ldapc directory should be modified to include the private version of adserr.h. KrishnaG said that the LDAP HRESULT codes together with the existing ADs HRESULT codes will be incorporated into winerror.h. I would also like to point out that in order to maintain a one-to-one relationship between the LDAP HRESULT codes and the LDAP error codes, whenever a new LDAP error code is added to winldap.h, a corresponding LDAP HRESULT code has to be defined.    LDAP HRESULT Code Naming Conventions The symbolic names of all the LDAP HRESULT codes are simply the symbolic names of the corresponding LDAP error code with the E_ADS_ prefix in front. For example, the symbolic name of the LDAP HRESULT code corresponding to LDAP_UNABLE_TO_PERFORM is E_ADS_LDAP_UNABLE_TO_PERFORM. Currently, the message string corresponding to an LDAP HRESULT code is simply the symbolic name of the corresponding LDPA error code. We are probably going to change those strings to something more descriptive since those strings are visible from within Visual Basic.  Translating an LDAP Error Code To An HRESULT All the LDAP HRESULT codes are of the form 0x800052xx(hexadecimal) where xx is the corresponding LDAP error codes. Under such an arrangement, translating an LDAP error code to an LDAP HRESULT is as simple as or ng the LDAP error code with the value 0x80005200. In fact, the symbol E_ADS_LDAP_BASE is defined to be 0x80005200 for this purpose. Conversely, one can translate an LDAP HRESULT back to an LDAP error code by masking off the highest 24 bits of an LDAP HRESULT. Note that this translating scheme works only if all the LDAP codes are within the range from 0x0 to 0xff. It is, however, very trivial to extend the current implementation to cover LDAP error codes larger than 0xff by replacing the or operation with the plus operation. Modifying CheckAndSetExtendedError to Support the LDAP HRESULT Codes The CheckAndSetExtendedError function in oleds\ldapc\ldaputil.cxx is used by most of the functions in ldaputil.cxx to translate an LDAP error code. Originally designed to map LDAP error code to win32 error code, the CheckAndSetExtendedError has been re-written to map LDAP error code to the new LDAP HRESULT code. Using the simple translation scheme suggested in the previous section, the size of CheckAndSetExtendedError is reduced considerably. The exceptional case where 0x09 represents both LDAP_REFERRAL_V2 and LDAP_PARTIAL_RESULTS still needs to be handled separately however. The old translation code is commented for future reference.   Identifying Code That Relies On The Old LDAP Error To Win32 Error Mapping Identifying code that needs to be re-written due to the introduction of the LDAP HRESULT codes is by far the most difficult task. Since most of the code in the ldap provider assumes that the functions in ldaputil.cxx (and perhaps in some other files) return a win32 error code, it takes the extra step to translate the error codes returned by these functions using the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macro. After the introduction of the LDAP HRESULT code, this extra translation step that appears throughout the LDAP provider will mangle the LDAP HRESULT code into something that is neither a valid win32 HRESULT code nor an LDAP HRESULT code. The RaiseException function created for extended error information support is unable to extract the proper error description string with the mangled error code.  Simply removing all the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macros from the LDAP provider will be incorrect because there are places where its use is legitimate. To make matters worse, functions within the ldapc layer are not consistently returning HRESULT s. Forcing all functions in the ldapc layer to return HRESULT s is a risky and daunting task, thus I limit myself to make sure that all the functions exported from adsldpc.dll return a valid HRESULT and that their return codes will not be mangled by HRESULT_FROM_WIN32. To identify portions of the LDAP provider (including the adsldpc.dll) that need to be modified, I apply the following heuristics: I verified portions of the code containing the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macro and applied changes if necessary. To make sure that the changes is complete, I also verified portions of code containing the variable dwStatus, a typical variable used for holding return code from the ldapc functions.  Besides preventing the LDAP HRESULT code from being mangled by the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macro, code that used to interpret the ldapc function return code as win32 error code needs to be re-written. For this purpose, I used the original CheckAndSetExtendedError as a reference for expanding win32 error that was mapped to multiple LDAP error codes. I verify that the modification is complete by re-examining portions of code containing the ERROR_ string, a typical prefix for win32 error. Once all of the above steps were carried out, I verified that my changes are reasonable by comparing my source files with the current version on the SLM server using windiff.

It concentrates on the COM interface for the Search APIs. It also describes the implementation of the LDAP and NDS search implementation. The COM Search Interface - IADsSearch The IADsSearch is responsible for the exposing the interface for Data Query in Active Directory Interface. It is also through this interface that the OLEDB provider is implemented. The IADsSearch Interface is implemented by the LDAP and NDS namespace objects. It can be obtained by the AdsGetObject() with szPath pointing to the Namespace identifier and the interface pointer to IID_IADsSearch. Interfaces IADsSearch::OpenSearchHandle HRESULT OpenSearchHandle( /* [in] */ LPWSTR szCommand,  /* [out */ HSEARCH *phSearch Description Open a search handle. Parameters szCommand The command string has the follow format <search_context>;<search_filter>;<attrlist>;[<searchScope>] where: search_context  = ADsPath of the base of the search search_filter   = search filter string in LDAP format (see [1] for details) attrlist = list of the attributes to display                Default is the ADsPath and Class attribute searchScope is one of: Base, OneLevel, or Subtree (Default) phSearch pointer to the Search Handle returned Returns DB_S_ENDOFROWSET         End of rowset was reached -- the method didn't advance E_FAIL               Call GetLastError for Win32 error code. E_OUTOFMEMORY Failed during memory allocation          IADsSearch::CloseSearchHandle HRESULT CloseSearchHandle( /* [in] */  HSEARCH hSearch Description Closes a search handle Parameters hSearch Search Handle obtained from OpenSearchHandle Returns E_FAIL               Call GetLastError for Win32 error code. IADsSearch::GetNextRow HRESULT GetNextRow( /* [in] */ HSEARCH hSearch Description This function advances the search handle to the next row. This opaque structure will be modified to point to the next row so that the subsequent calls to ADsLdpGetColumn will get columns from this row. This function does not return or allocate anything and the only effect of this function is to change the state internal to the handle to the next row. Parameters hSearchHandle  The present search handle. Returns DB_S_ENDOFROWSET         End of rowset was reached -- the method didn't advance E_FAIL               Call GetLastError for Win32 error code. E_OUTOFMEMORY Failed during memory allocation IADsSearch::GetColumn HRESULT GetColumn(        /* [in] */  HSEARCH hSearch,        /* [in] */  LPWSTR szColumnName,       /* [out] */ ADS_SEARCHCOLUMN *pSearchColumn Description This function returns the value for the column denoted by pszColumnName for the current row. A new ADSPROVIDER_COLUMN structure will be allocated and returned. This has to be freed using the function FreeColumn. Parameters hSearchHandle The present search handle. pszColumnName The name for the column whose value is to be obtained pColumn Pointer to the ADS_SEARCHCOLUMN structure; When done with using this column, this needs to be freed with FreeColumn Returns E_FAIL               Call GetLastError for Win32 error code. IADsSearch::FreeColumn HRESULT FreeColumn(        /* [in] */ ADS_SEARCHCOLUMN *pSearchColumn Description Free the column returned by GetColumn Parameters PSearchColumn Pointer to the column returned by GetColumn Returns E_FAIL               Call GetLastError for Win32 error code. IADsSearch::GetDataType HRESULT GetDataType(       /* [in] */  LPWSTR pszBindContext,      /* [in] */  LPWSTR pszAttrNam,      /* [out] */  WORD *pwType,      /* [out] */  ULONG *pulSize Description This interface is created temporarily to get the data type of an attribute from the schema. It will be taken out once the extended syntax support for the schema is available. Structure and type definitions ADS_SEARCHCOLUMN typedef struct ADSSEARCHCOLUMN      {     DWORD _dbStatus;     DWORD _dwLength;     WORD  _dwType;     union          {         LONG _lVal;         BOOL _bVal;         LPSTR _strVal;         LPWSTR _wstrVal;         BYTE *_byteVal;         }       ;     }   ADS_SEARCHCOLUMN; Description It is the data structure returned by GetColumn to indicate the information contained in the current column HSEARCH typedef ULONG HSEARCH; Description The search  handle type The implementation The query is directly passed as strings to winldap.dll. As a result, no special parsing or conversion of the string is necessary for data queries to LDAP. For NDS, we are supporting data queries through the format of LDAP search filters The Grammer This section describes the basic grammer of the LDAP search filters. It has been simplied to suit our needs. As a result, you may find it slightly different than the one described in [1]. <Currently unused> ATR FT VAL FT -> The LR Parser To parse the LDAP search filter in NDS, we implemented an LR parser. It is an efficient, bottom-up syntax analysis technique that can be used to parse context-free grammers. The   is for left-to-right scanning of the input, the   for constructing a rightmost derivation in reverse.  A detail description of the algorithm to do LR parsing can be found in [2]. The starting symbol we use is the F (Filter) symbol. The table below describes the transition state of the grammers. Each row is considered as a state that the parser is in.The algorithm also requires the definition of a Follow and Goto table which can be found below. The Transition Table F->.(FC) F->(.FC) FC->.AND FC->.OR FC->.NOT FC->.ITM AND->.&FL OR->.|FL NOT->.!F ITM->.SMP ITM->.PRS SMP->.ATR FT VAL PRS->.ATR  FC->AND. FC->OR. FC->NOT. FC->ITM. F->(FC.) ITM->SMP. ITM->PRS. AND->&.FL FL->.F FL->.FFL F->.(FC) OR->|.FL FL->.F FL->.FFL F->.(FC) NOT->!.F F->.(FC) SMP->ATR.FT VAL PRS->ATR. FT->. FT->. FT->. FT->. F->(FC). AND->&FL. FL->F. FL->F.FL FL->.F FL->.FFL F->.(FC) OR->|FL. NOT->!F. PRS->ATR  SMP->ATR FT. VAL SMP->ATR FT VAL. FL->F FL. The Goto Rule: The Follow Rule: LDAP Tree Generation The LDAP is the generic tree format used to represent an LDAP query string. The parser that we implemented is one-pass. The LDAP tree is generated as the expression is being parsed. However, due to the fact that some syntax supports multiple children, (e.g. (&(Object Class=User)(CN=JamesL)(Description=SDE))  ), the tree that we produced is not a binary tree but a tree with multiple children.  The tree generation take place whenever the grammer is reduced(by the symbol R in the table above). The generated tree is then stored on the stack, waiting to be used by the next reduction rule. NDS Tree generation The NDS tree is generated from the generic LDAP tree. One interesting thing about the LDAP query is that the search string does not contain any type information. As a result, once an attribute type is received, the schema has to be queried to find out what data type that attribute supports. In order to achieve that, all the attributes are stored in an attribute list during parsing. After the LDAP tree is genereated, the list of attributes are sent to the server to ask for their syntax types. With the LDAP tree and the attribute syntax in hand, the NDS tree is then generated and passed to the NDS search function to query for data.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Setting Up a New Developer Machine Title _PID_GUID _PID_HLINKSSetting Up a New Developer Machine Ajay S. Ramachandran Normal.dot Ajay S. Ramachandran Microsoft Word 8.0 ~^>}\f.A}\ Setting Up a New Developer Machine in the ADSI Group Important Note on the responsibility of developers from the designer and Dev Lead on this project KrishnaG : I want to explain something here very clearly. Test is supposed to test functionality that is working and robust. While you can work to get private code of yours tested by the test team, this is NOT the standard procedure.  You do not get test to sign off on every line of code that you check in.  Therefore if there is a piece of functionality that you own you are responsible for making sure that it works. If it breaks after you check it in, then the responsibility is yours - you cannot point fingers and say that we had test try it out so it is not our fault. If you need to set up complex test scenarios to test your product, it is YOUR job to test it and check it in. I would personally be very distressed if any developer were to tell me that they are sitting on a ton of code because they are waiting for test to test it for them. Please refrain from this! It is necessary sometimes as when we are in ship-mode so that we do not break anything - NOT when we are in a development cycle. Being a developer at Microsoft is a great job - it is the highest basic commendation. you can get in this company. With that commendation  however comes significant responsibility and ownership. One of the responsibilities is that  the code  you write works perfectly. You cannot expect to take credit for something if you did not do it completely and got someone to help you with it! Thanks! Krishna Objectives: Install a new build/upgrading to a new build Installing a development environment. Enlist in some useful projects Working, building, compiling and debugging Step 1: Installing the new build/upgrading Installing Windows NT For this the ideal location will be c:\nt4. A stable version can be put in there and an additional one can be used for development. The first installation has to be done using a floppy and the CD-ROM. The data on the disk is destroyed and it is done using the format disk to NTFS (usually). The computer should be made a member of the domain NTDEV. This can be achieved by using the account NTDS with a NULL password. Getting the latest build The latest build can be got by C:\winnt> net use *   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\  \\ntbuilds\release\ That will give the logical drive say F: C:\winnt> F: F:\> cd usa\release\latest.idw\fre.wks\winnt32 F:\usa\release\latest.idw\fre.wks\winnt32>winnt32 This will start NT 5 installation. It will prompt for directory to pick up the files from, that will be a level higher, the fre.wks directory. Once that is done the process is pretty much automatic. Most often it will be updating an existing build to the latest version. Selecting upgrade when the prompt arrives will take care of the process. The entire process will take some time and will involve the machine being shutdown automatically (provided that option is chosen at the appropriate dialog ( ). Also, the new hardware detected window will keep popping up and that is just kept in a corner. After installation, it s a good idea to login as administrator and add your own userid to the administrator group. E.g. redmond/felixw Step 2: Enlisting a new development environment C:\winnt mstools symbols The above structure has to be created so that we can start installing the developer environment. The files have to copied into these directories (note they are copied and not just enlisted/ghosted). It is assumed that F: is still alive for the below. C:\winnt\mstools>xcopy /chedi f:\usa\latest.idw\x86\fre.wks\mstools\*.*  C:\winnt\idw>xcopy /chedi f:\usa\latest.idw\x86\fre.wks\idw\*.* C:\winnt\symbols>xcopy /chedi f:\usa\latest.idw\x86\fre.wks\symbols\*.* Environment Variables The following are the list of environment variables to be set 1)Add the following to the existing path %systemRoot%\mstools;%SystemRoot\idw;d:\nt\public\tools 2)Set _ntdrive to the appropriate drive where the nt build resides Step 3: Enlisting in useful projects Before we start, it makes sense to have a volume id for the d drive typically AJAYR1. In that drive create the hierarchy Private Public ( all in small letters ( ) The following  ghost  the structure and essentially the process makes sure we get the projects being worked on by MARSDEV are available locally (at least the ADSI related parts). d:\nt\private> enlist   HYPERLINK \\\\orville\\razzle  \\orville\razzle p private d:\nt\public> enlist   HYPERLINK \\\\orville\\razzle  \\orville\razzle p public D:\nt\public\oak> ssync  D:\nt\public\tools>ssync -urf D:\nt\public\sdk\inc> ssync -u D:\nt\public\sdk\bin> ssync -urf D:\nt\public\sdk\lib>  ssync  D:\nt\public\sdk\lib\i386> ssync  Then we copy the other files that are needed from the   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release  \\ntbuilds\release  server. Xxxx is the build number. Please ask your mentor which build you should install. D:\nt\public>xcopy /chedi i:  Where I points to the   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release  \\ntbuilds\release \usa\xxxx\x86\fre.pub  Picking up oleds : D:\nt\private> md oleds D:\nt\private> cd oleds D:\nt\private\oleds> enlist   HYPERLINK \\\\kernel\\razzle3  \\kernel\razzle3 p oleds D:\nt\private\oleds> ssync  D:\nt\private> md nw D:\nt\private\nw>enlist   HYPERLINK \\\\orville\\razzle  \\orville\razzle p minimars D:\nt\private\nw>ssynch  D:\nt\private\developr> ssynch  Create a directory under developr with your userid and get the necessary files from another machine D:\nt\private\windows>enlist   HYPERLINK \\\\rastaman\\ntwin  \\rastaman\ntwin p windows Synch in net\inc and also in inc6 in private windows D:\nt\private\windows\inc>ssynch  D:\nt\private\windows\inc16>ssynch -u D:\nt\private>md net D:\nt\private\net>enlist orville\razzle  p net D:\nt\private\net\inc>ssynch  D:\nt\private\inc>ssync  D:\nt\private\net\svcdlls\fpnw\inc>ssync -u Step 4: Building ADSI This should bring the state of the machine to  build  ready. The actual build can be done by going to the oleds in private and then running build. D:\nt\private\oleds>build  Step 5: Setting up Your Private Directory Once the previous steps are completed, you should start experimenting with ADSI. There is a program called adsvw.exe which is a complete browser/editor for ActiveDirectory. You can use advw.exe to browse the directories of NTDEV domain and REDMOND domain but you don t have permission to modify them. In order to access all the features in adsvw.exe, you need to set up your own private directory. To have your private directory you have to install Windows NT Server on your machine and it a domain controller of a completely isolated domain. You can execute the following commands to start the installation on Windows NT Server on your machine: (Before you do the following, you should make sure that you have about 300mb of disk space somewhere on your machine.) C:<anywhere>>net use *   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release  \\ntbuilds\release (Assuming that the share is mounted onto logical drive e:  ) C:<anywhere>>e:\usa\latest.idw\x86\fre.srv\winnt32\winnt32 The NT setup dialogue box should pop up after you have executed the command. You should choose the  Install..  option rather than the  Upgrade..  option. Alternatively, you may be able to specify an  Install  flag when you execute winnt32; you may want to check out the winnt32 documentation for details. Note that if you want to install a particular build, you can simply replace latest.idw in the last command with the build number you want. After all the installation files have been copied over to your machine, your machine will reboot and the server setup program will start. Since your goal is to build a completely independent domain, you have to be very careful when answer certain network setup related questions. In particular, you want to adhere to the following guidelines: You will be asked for the target directory for your NT Server installation. Do not choose a path where one of your previous NT installations resides if you want to keep the old installation. It may not be a bad idea to choose c:\winnt.srv as the NT Server target directory.  Make you machine a domain controller. Remember the name you have assigned to your computer, you will need that later on. Install the following protocols on your machine in addition to TCP/IP: Network Monitor Agent Driver, NetBEUI Protocol, and NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Transport Protocol. If you forget to add the protocols during setup, you can always add them later using the control panel. Do not join an existing domain tree.  You should give your new domain a DNS name such as mydomain.ntdev.microsoft.com. Since your new domain is not part of an existing domain tree, you will be asked for the name of your first site. You should use the name you have assigned to your computer earlier. Do not attempt to use a DNS name with dots in it, setup will not accept the name even though the message box says you can use a DNS name for your first site. (This may change in the future.) At the end of the networking setup phase, setup will promote your site (domain?). This process usually takes a couple of minutes. Once the promotion is completed, setup will ask you a couple more questions about time zone and display before rebooting your machine for one more time. When your machine restarts, you will have your own private domain and directory to play with. To make your new server installation more enjoyable to use, you should add a new user with the same usrid as the one for your REDMOND account. You should also make the user as a member of the Administrators group. These two tasks can be done through User Manager for Domain. Once the new user is set up, you should log in as the new user exclusively. In order to do some serious debugging, you have to set up the build environment again on your server installation by carrying out the procedure outlined in Step 2. You may also want to set up  Mail, IE, and some applications on your server installation again. Note that you are now completely isolated from the REDMOND domain so you have to specify explicitly that you are a REDMOND user when you access any servers in the REDMOND domain. For example, you have to add the /user:REDMOND\<your usrid> switch to the net use command when you try to mount a REDMOND file share.  You will also encounter problems when you try to use slm commands from your private domain. There seems to be no simple solutions to this problem. You can execute all your slm commands from your original NT Workstation installation or you can have another enlistment (You may not be able to do so). Having more than one enlistment can be a nightmare because it is difficult to track which enlistment you are editing. Step 6: Tracing through ADSI Code inside a Debugger  All of ADSI runs in user mode so it is relatively easy to set up source-level debugging. If you are not familiar with debugging on NT, there are some debugging documents available on the ntstress home page (http://ntstress). When you are reading through the debugging documents, you should pay attention to how to set up your build environment for generating executables that include both the standard symbols and the source-level debugging. If you have built your executables before setting up the build environment to include the desired debugging symbols, you have to rebuild all the executables by going to the oleds directory and type  build  .  Once you have generated executables with all the symbols you need, you have to install your binaries onto the operating system. This can be done by copying the ADSI dlls to the %windir%/system32 directory by executing the following commands: C:<anywhere>>copy %_ntdrive%\public\sdk\lib\i386\ads*.dll %windir%\system32 C:<anywhere>>copy %_ntdrive%\public\sdk\lib\i386\activeds.dll %windir%\system32 The install.cmd script in the oleds project will also work but it will try to install files that you don t have. You can just skip all the files that install.cmd complains about. After copying all the files, you should be able to get source-level debugging for ADSI. Now you should invoke either Windbg adsvw.exe  Msdev adsvw.exe to start debugging adsvw.exe. Note that if you want to have source-level debugging for adsvw.exe, you have to use the executable in %_ntdrive%\private\oleds\oledsvw\obj\i386\ or you can simply copy your own adsvw.exe to %windir%\system32. When the debugger is started, you may want to set breakpoints on the following main entry points of ADSI: adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::Create adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::SetInfo adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::Put adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::Get adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::GetInfo adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::OpenSearchHandle adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::GetNextRow adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::GetNextColumn adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::CloseSearchHandle adsldp!CLDAPGGenObject::Delete Note that if you attempt to step into Ads* functions directly, the debugger may not be able to maintain source-level stepping because COM sits between the ADSI code and the client. You should experiment with creating a new ADS object, setting properties, getting properties, searching and deleting. For searching, you can create a new query with the filter  objectClass=user Creating New Objects This section details how to create a new object (class). The easiest way is to clone a set of files which are already there. One such set is the csed* cxx and hxx files in router. Copy csed*.cxx and hxx to foo*.cxx and hxx. There are usaull four files foo.cxx, foo.hxx and foocf.cxx and foocf.hxx (where the cf files are the class factories). Generate the new guid s if necessary using uuidgen (think you will need 2 per class need to confirm this). Add the new guids to OLEDS_IID_IADsFoo and OLEDS_CLSID_Foo in header.h in types. In the types directory create foo.odl and add to the ads.odl master odl file. Build it to generate a new iads.h header file. Copy iads.h to sdkinc (remember to check it in when checking in the other changes). In oleds\include\intf.hxx add the macro DECLARE_IADsFoo_Methods. Update the appropriate sources file where you added the four files for foo. Update the new header used to generate the .pch file (oleds.hxx in the router). Put the guids in the oledsiid\guid.c file. Update the library entry point usually in libmain.cxx. Update core.odl if necessary. Build and copy activeds.tlb to system32 dir. You will have to add registry entries for the new class. Looking at the setup\activeds.inf file and adding to it the appropriate entries for the created classes can do this. You can run this inf to update your registry. Note that the setup for NT5.0 registry keys is different and I am not sure how it is done. Troubleshooting hint: If the code is not being called verify that the tlb has been called and that the registry entries have been set correctly. Please update the above if you find that something is wrong or not accurate. Building Oleds/ADSI on NT4 There are a few things to be done that need to be done to build oleds on NT4. First you will need NT4 publics these can be picked up from   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\relase\\usa\\1381.sp1  \\ntbuilds\relase\usa\1381.sp1 You will need NT4 tools also (it is not necessary to have an NT4 build installed on your machine but it is not that bad an idea as you can then debug on the machine). You need to make sure that your env variables point to the NT4 locations. Additionally you will need to set the following : ADSI_NT40_BUILD=1 If you do not set this, then you will build as though it is the NT5 tree.  You will probably need an updated placefil.txt. I will update the doc once I have a location for it. I think it is worth checking into the project tree. ~ytoje`[ ~ytoje`[ |wrmhc^YTO ~ytojcY ~{{xurolif

The Grammar The grammer we used is a subset derived from the SQL grammer. The Terminal Tokens TERMINAL SYMBOLS (TOKENS) to be expected by the parser.

It is an efficient, bottom-up syntax analysis technique that can be used to parse context-free grammars. The   is for left-to-right scanning of the input, the   for constructing a rightmost derivation in reverse.  A detail description of the algorithm to do LR parsing can be found in [1]. The starting symbol we use is the F (Filter) symbol. The table below describes the transition state of the grammers. Each row is considered as a state that the parser is in. The algorithm also requires the definition of an action and Goto table which can be found below.

expression is being parsed, a syntax tree representing the query will be generated. This tree contains a GenerateLDAP function which will be called to produce the LDAP equivalent of the representation. This expression is then passed into the LDAP or NDS Active Directory Interface DLLs to carry out the actual query.

Grammar for the SQL dialect support in ADSI's OLE DB provider. 

The grammar we used is a subset derived from the SQL ODBC miniumum grammar.

2.1 The Terminal Tokens
TERMINAL SYMBOLS (TOKENS) to be expected by the parser. 

TOKEN_ERROR              
TOKEN_STAR               
TOKEN_LPARAN             
TOKEN_RPARAN             
TOKEN_INTEGER_LITERAL    
TOKEN_REAL_LITERAL       
TOKEN_STRING_LITERAL     
TOKEN_USER_DEFINED_NAME  
TOKEN_COMMA              
TOKEN_SELECT             
TOKEN_ALL                
TOKEN_FROM               
TOKEN_WHERE              
TOKEN_BOOLEAN_LITERAL 
TOKEN_AND                
TOKEN_OR                 
TOKEN_NOT    
TOKEN_END           
TOKEN_LT
TOKEN_GT
TOKEN_GE
TOKEN_LE
TOKEN_EQ
TOKEN_NE

2.2 The Grammer
statement ::= select-statement

select-statement ::= TOKEN_SELECT [TOKEN_ALL] select-list TOKEN_FROM table-identifier     [TOKEN_WHERE search-condition] 

select-list ::= TOKEN_STAR | select-sublist [TOKEN_COMMA select-sublist]... 

select-sublist ::= column-identifier

column-identifier ::= TOKEN_USER_DEFINED_NAME 

table-identifier ::= TOKEN_STRING_LITERAL 

search-condition ::= boolean-term [TOKEN_OR search-condition]

boolean-term ::= boolean-factor [TOKEN_AND boolean-term]

boolean-factor ::= [TOKEN_NOT] boolean-primary

boolean-primary ::= comparison-predicate | TOKEN_LPARAN search-condition TOKEN_RPARAN

comparison-predicate ::= column-identifier TOKEN_COMPARISON_OPERATOR literal

literal ::= TOKEN_STRING_LITERAL | numeric-literal  | TOKEN_BOOLEAN_LITERAL 

numeric-literal ::= TOKEN_INTEGER_LITERAL | TOKEN_REAL_LITERAL



For example, the tokens generated by the lexer for the following SQL statement

SELECT CN, objectClass FROM 'LDAP://ntdsdc1/c=US/O=Microsoft/OU=NTDS' WHERE
ObjectClass = User OR AGE > 25

DRT directory etiquette

If you have a drt program in the ADSI project, you must add yourself as the
owner of the drt program. It is the owner's responsibility to ensure that the
drt program always builds correctly and is current with the rest of the source
base. By default drt programs must always be built with a clean build.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6Microsoft MicrosoftMicrosoft Sunil Pai Normal Sunil Pai Microsoft Word for Windows 95Microsoft Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Beta 2 Release Notes Required Operating System Version Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 requires the retail release of Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, Build 1381.  To determine the Windows NT build number you have installed: Click the Start button on the Taskbar.  Click on Run.  Type WinVer in the text area of the Run dialog box.  Winver displays a popup window containing information on the installed version of Windows NT.  Providers Included in this Release This beta release of Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 includes providers for:  LDAP v2 Windows NT 4.0 NetWare 3.x NetWare 4.x Important Installation Notes for NetWare Users This beta release of Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 requires Microsoft's Gateway Service for NetWare for Windows NT Server or Client Services for NetWare for Windows NT Workstation.  The NOVELL Windows NT Client for NetWare is not supported at this time.  Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 provides an updated version of NWAPI32.DLL that contains additional functions needed by Active Directory Interfaces. The new NWAPI32.DLL is automatically installed for you. Installing in the correct order is essential.  First: Install the "Client Services for NetWare" (for Windows NT Workstation) or "Gateway Service for NetWare" (for Windows NT Server).  This is provided with the Windows NT operating system and is installed from the Network applet,  reached via the "Start->Settings->Control Panel" menu choices.   Select the "Services" tab and click "Add" to add the NetWare service if it is not already installed. Next: Install the Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Beta.  The installation replaces the NWAPI32.DLL with the updated version for this beta. Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Path Formats Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Namespaces To enumerate the installed Active Directory Interfaces namespaces,  start with the ADS: object.  In Visual Basic,  the ADS: object is instantiated at follows: Dim ns as IADsNamespaces Set ns = GetObject("ADS:") Enumerate the namespaces installed using the namespaces object just obtained: Dim obj as IADs For Each obj in ns debug.print obj.name Next obj Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Paths for LDAP are in the form: LDAP://ServerName/NamingAttribute=Value/NamingAttribute=Value/ where the NamingAttribute= is an X.500 style attribute tag,  for example C=, O=,  OU=.  Windows NT  Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Paths for Windows NT are in the form: WinNT://DomainName/object/subobject/... For example,  user JamesSmith in the Fictional domain has an Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Path of: WinNT://Fictional/JamesSmith NetWare 3.x Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Paths for NetWare 3.x are in the form: NWCOMPAT://ServerName/Object/subobject/... For example,  user JamesSmith in the Fictional server has an Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Path of: NWCOMPAT://Fictional/JamesSmith NetWare 4.x Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Paths for NetWare 4.x are in the form: NDS://TreeName/O=NAME/subobj=name/... For example, user JamesSmith, in the Accounting OU in the FictionalOrg in the Fictional tree has an Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 path of:  NDS://Fictional/O=FictionalOrg/OU=Accounting/CN=JamesSmith Notes on Objects and Properties Supported by This Release Security Objects and Interfaces are not Implemented The Access Control subobject is not implemented in this beta release of Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0.   Consequently the Access and PropAccess methods documented in the Design Specification are not implemented. Resource Objects are not supported by NetWare 3.x and 4.x The FileServiceOperations interfaces for NetWare 3.x and NetWare 4.x do not support Resources,  consequently the IADsFileServiceOperations::Resources  method returns E_NOTIMPL for these providers. Not all Providers Implement all Properties The Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Design Specification defines properties for each "Standard" Active Directory Interfaces object.  Providers implement only those properties in each set that can be reasonably mapped to properties in the underlying system (e.g. Windows NT, NetWare 3.x, and NetWare 4.x).  Attempts to read or write properties that are not implemented will result in an error, "E_ADS_PROPERTY_NOT_SUPPORTED",  which has the hexadecimal value "0x80005006".     Each provider supplies the Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Schema management objects and properties that represent their Active Directory Interfaces implementation.  The properties reported by a given provider's schema are always readable and writeable using the generic Get and Put methods on the IADs interface.  Properties reported via the schema management interfaces are those actually defined by the underlying system and may have different names and syntax than the "Standard" properties defined by Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0.  Development Tools This beta release of Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 has been tested with Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0,  32-bit version,  and Microsoft Visual C++ Version 4.2.  Other development tools that can act as OLE Automation controllers or instantiate and invoke methods in COM objects may work with Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0,  but have not been tested. Compiling and running Visual Basic Programs. 1] Start Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Professional or Enterprise Edition 2] Create a new VB project. A VB project is a collection of your Visual Basic files that will constitute your application 3] To enable your newly created project to use Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0, you need to select "Tools Menu->References". The  "References" dialog allows you to identify the object libraries that your VB program will use. 4] Locate the Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 Object Library ("ADS.tlb"). This binary file is installed in your system32 directory (%windir%\system32) and add this to your list of references. 5] Save your project. To verify that your project can now understand Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 data types and Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 automation interfaces, select the "View Menu->Object Browser" command. This will  list all of the available VB libraries that the development environment knows of. The drop-down list should now show the "ADS types" library. Examine the contents of "ADS types" library.You should now be able to reference any of these "ADS types" in your VB application. Documentation Errata NetWare 3.x and 4.x Providers:  Authentication issues In this release you may experience problems when working with NetWare servers. If you do, you can work around the problem by making sure you are properly logged on to the server (the easiest way is to map a drive to a volume on the server). NetWare 4.x Provider:  Creating a User object To create a user object in NDS using the Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 NetWare 4.x provider perform the following steps: Create a new Object of  class "User"  (case sensitive). Set a value for Surname (any value). DO NOT set a value for CN.  There is a known problem that will cause SetInfo to fail if a value is specified for CN (see below).  This will be corrected in the released version of Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0. Call SetInfo to create the new user. Read the new object back using GetObject (or ADSGetObject for C/C++ users). Call SetPassword method of the IADsUser interface to set a password for the user. Netware 4.x Provider: Issue modifying schema When using this Beta product with NDS, be careful not to modify the schema inadvertently as this may lead to problems with your NDS installation. NetWare 4.x Provider:  Property  Class  must be set correctly When creating a new object,  the  Class  property must be set correctly to the NDS schema class of the object being created, i.e.   etc. NetWare 4.x Provider:  Issue Setting the Naming Attribute When creating a new object,  explicitly setting the objects naming attribute (for example CN for users, O for Organization, OU for Organizational Unit) will cause SetInfo to fail.  NetWare 3.x and Compatible Provider: Creating a User object After creating a user object,  you must change the password from an empty string to a new value.  Call the ChangePassword method to apply the change;  the SetPassword method is not implemented for the NWCOMPAT provider in this beta release. NetWare 3.x and Compatible Provider: Viewing FPNW File Shares To view file shares on a Windows NT server running Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare,  you must have the File and Print Services for NetWare administration tools installed on the system where Active Directory Interfaces Version 1.0 is being used for this purpose.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\ds\dns\server\samples\dnsread.txt ===
The Microsoft DNS Server is currently beta software.

-------
Release
-------

The MS NT DNS server will ship as part of NT Server 4.0.
(The latest public version is the NT4.0 beta 2 release.)

There will no official NT3.51 release of the MS DNS server and no
support for the MS DNS on NT 3.51.

The dnsbeta and dnsbug aliases are no longer monitored.  As this is now
an official release, all support issues should be addressed through the
standard NT4.0 beta channels:

For support and bug reports regarding NT 4.0 DNS beta, use the WINNT40
beta forum on Compuserve, and post in the Networking/Protocols section.

For Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) customers that receive NT 4.0
Server, use the MSDNLIB forum, section Winnt40.


------------
Installation
------------

For WindowsNT 4.0 (SUR) Beta, the DNS server is part of the normal setup
process and may be installed, during network services installation.  If
not installed during setup, DNS may be installed using the network control
panel applet.   After services control panel applet may be used to set
the startup mode of the DNS service.  I recommend using manual startup.

If you have previously installed the MS DNS service, and are simply
updating to a later release:

    1.  Stop the DNS service.  Type "net stop DNS" on the command line, or
        use the services manager in the control panel.

    2.  Copy all DNS binaries to the system32 directory.

    3.  Run dnssetup.exe.  This configures your registry to properly
        start the DNS service.

    4.  Copy any database files to system32\dns directory.  If using DNS
        manager to configure your site, copy cache.dns to system32\dns.
        A valid cache file is the minimum requirement to boot the server
        and be able to configure it with the DnsAdmin.

    5.  "net start dns" will restart your DNS service.


-------------
Configuration
-------------

You must have a set of database files in place in order for the
DNS service to start.

All database files MUST be in %SystemRoot%\system32\dns.

Required:
  - A cache file (named cache.dns)
    OR
  - A boot file and the database files specified by in the boot file.

You are encouraged to use the DnsAdmin tool to configure the DNS database
files for your site.  If you have existing database files, the DnsAdmin
can have the DNS server read those files in.

OR if you have an existing BIND installation at your site, you can
simply use your existing BOOT file and database files, place them in the
system32\dns directory and be ready to run.

NOTE:  sample files are included if you wish to edit files manually, but
you are encouraged to use the DNS admin tool.


---------------
WINS Resolution
---------------

The MS DNS server now contains fast, asynchronous resolution through WINS
lookup.

In some settings, particularly installations with DHCP enabled WindowsNT,
Windows95 or WFW3.11 clients, it will be advantageous to enable the DNS
service to lookup unresolved names through WINS.

First you must decide which DNS zones have WINS clients.  Then on the
DNS server for that zone, enable WINS resolution, pointing the DNS
server at the appropriate WINS server(s) that serves the hosts in that
zone.

For example, you might have DHCP configured WINS clients in the domain
"place.dom." Then with WINS lookup if a query for "testhost.place.dom."
that was NOT found in the place.dom database file, WINS servers would be
queried for "TESTHOST" resolving the host's address.

- Setup:

For each forward lookup domain in which you wish to attempt WINS
resolution of hostnames, add the "WINS" resource record.  See the
example in place.dom sample file.

For each reverse lookup domain in which you wish to attempt reverse WINS
resolution, use the "WINS-R" RR.

WINS resolution is setup for a zone through the zone properties dialog
in the DNS manager.  (Right click on the zone you wish to configure for
WINS or WINS Reverse resolution.)

- How WINS lookup works:

When the DNS server gets an address query for a name in an
authoritative zone configured for WINS lookup, and there is NO A record
for the queried name, then the DNS server queries the WINS server.  The
query is done for the workstation name so for a machine to be found by
DNS through WINS, it MUST have the workstation service running (it is on
by default) and be using one of the WINS servers used by the DNS server.
When the WINS server responds the name and address(es) is cached for 10
minutes.  The short caching time allows the DNS to respond rapidly when
machines change there IP address through DHCP.

Note that these cached A records from WINS lookup are NOT transfered
during a zone transfer.  They are not permanent and are not complete.
The correct "transfer" is to have the secondary DNS servers also running
WINS lookup.  The WINS record itself may be configured to be included in
the zone transfer.

- How WINS-R (reverse WINS) lookup works:

When the DNS server gets a PTR query for a name in an authoritative
reverse lookup zone configured for NBSTAT lookup, and there is NO PTR
record for the queried name, then the DNS server does a netBIOS node
status query on the IP address through NBT.  When netBIOS returns, DNS
checks through the registered names and picks the "best" one.  Priority
is given to the workstation name, then the server name, then any unique
name.  The resulting name is appended with the NBSTAT result domain name
and a PTR record with the IP to name mapping is cached for 10 minutes.

Note that as in the case of WINS, the cached PTR records themselves are
not sent in a zone transfer.  The NBSTAT record itself will be sent in
the zone transfer unless the "LOCAL" flag is set.

- Zone transfer of WINS / WINS-R

There is an additional flag for the WINS and WINS-R directives in the
zone transfer file to allow better interoperability with UNIX during a
corporate rollout and handle remote sites more efficiently.

In the DNS Manager under zone properties WINS / WINS-R dialog check the
box "Settings only affect local server", to avoid sending these records
in a zone transfer.

To set this flag can be set in the database files, specify the LOCAL
flag immediately after the WINS or WINS-R record type.  For example:

   @  WINS  LOCAL 1.1.1.1  1.1.1.2

On the primary DNS server, this directive keeps the record from being
sent in a zone transfer.  On the secondary DNS server, it keeps the
record around even after a zone transfer is sent.  This allows you to be
a secondary to a UNIX DNS, or to specify different WINS servers for a
secondary which may be at a remote site away from the primary.


--------------------
Problems + Reminders
--------------------

-> Consult the eventlog.

The DNS server logs numerous errors, warnings and useful information to the
event log.  If a problem is encountered be sure to check the eventlog.


-> Error 13:  The data is invalid.
The DNS service will return this error when it is unable to load the
database.

1) The location for the DNS database files is now hardcoded to the
%SystemRoot%\system32\dns directory.  DNS configuration and zone files
will not be read from the %system32%\drivers\etc directory or from a
directory indicated by the $DIRECTORY directive.

2) Consult the event log.  Most error conditions are reported in the
eventlog.  Those involving problems loading the files usually include
file and line number.


-> Doubled domain names.
A common DNS error is double domain names caused by failing to place
trailing periods (".") at the end of fully qualified DNS names.

If the error goes away when you ping the IP address (e.g., pinging
foobar's IP address gives the correct name), then the problem must
involve either a CNAME or A record (or both) for foobar with a
fully-qualified (totally spelled out) domain name on the right hand
side, that does not end in 'dot'.

Otherwise, the problem is two-fold:
        1) The reverse-lookup file for the in-addr.arpa domain has the wrong
domain name in the SOA record, in this case, "dc-tbc.microsoft.com."
instead of "xxx.in-addr.arpa."
        2) The PTR record for that IP number has an FQDN on the
right-hand-side (as it generally must) and does not end in 'dot'.

Generally, If you type the trailing dot on the command line and the
lookup fails, but it succeeds with a short name, your database files
have missing dots at the end of FQDNs.


-  Nslookup Incompatibilities

Some versions of nslookup require server support of the IQUERY opcode,
which is a deprecated method of looking up an IP number.

An example session with such an nslookup follows:

  machine# nslookup
  *** Can't find server name for address 1.2.3.4: Not implemented
  *** Can't find initialize address for server : Timed out
  Default Server:  localhost
  Bus error (core dumped)
  machine#

The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a newer version of
nslookup, which is publicly available on the internet.

A work-around to this problem is to point nslookup to a BIND name server
at startup and then issue the "lserver" command to change servers.  Most
nslookup versions support the syntax: "nslookup - initial_server".  Be
sure to specify the initial server as an IP number.


-----
Notes
-----

- Auto-created reverse lookup zones:

The DNS server will automatically create the 0.in-addr.arpa,
127.in-addr.arpa and 255.in-addr.arpa zones if your database setup does
not include them.

These zones answer bogus queries for 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 and
255.255.255.255 IP addresses, keeping these queries from being recursed
to the root name servers.  You are encouraged to simple allow the DNS to
create these zones and not bother creating themselves.


- Statistics

The DNS server provides some statistics on server behavior.
The DNS manager exposes a very limited subset of these.  For viewing and
clearing the full set of statistics use the DnsCmd.exe tool.


- Address sorting

No attempt is made to sort addresses of multi-homed hosts (hosts with
multiple addresses).  The DNS server round robins the address list of
all multi-homed hosts.  This is the simplest solution for handling load
balancing to a multi-homed server.  If this solution is insufficient for
or causes problems at your site, please send a bug report explaining the
issue.  Optionally providing alternatives to round robinning is under
consideration.


- SNMP + Perfmon

The DNS does not currently export its counters through SNMP or Perfmon.
This support will be added after the NT4.0 release.


- Unsupported directives:

* directory directive (all database files must be in system32\dns)
* sortlist directive
* $INCLUDE directive


- Supported resource records:

A, PTR, NS, SOA, CNAME, MX, MB, MR, MG, HINFO, TXT, MINFO, RT, RP, X25,
ISDN, WKS, AFSDB, AAAA are fully supported.

Note the AAAA is only supported as record data.  It is NOT SUPPORTED as
a DNS host address, i.e. it is NOT returned as additional record data
during a query for NS or other record types.

The MD and MF resource types are not supported in database files.  These
record types are obsolete, and references to them should be change to
the MX type.  Occurences of these types in database files are logged to
the EventLog.


- Learning about DNS:

I recommend reading "DNS and BIND" by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu
(publisher: O'Reilly and Associates).  This book is a great introduction
to the Domain Name System, and to configuring BIND database files.

;Revision History:
;
;    stevenju - remove legacy containers from domain root that are now
;               in the SYSTEM folder
;
;    stevenju - added default containers for Winsock, RPC
;               changed default domain to class Domain-Organization
;
;    6/12/98  - edit out sections to leave only those needed for mkdit.
;               rename to mkdit.ini from schema.ini (split this file
;               out from schema.ini)

The value of this attribute is the time-in-seconds that the entry will continue to exist before disappearing from the directory. In the absence of intervening "refresh" operations, the values returned by reading the attribute in two successive searches are guaranteed to be non-increasing. The smallest permissible value is 0, indicating that the entry may disappear without warning.
