ecture has been successfully specified and implemented in USB, IEEE 1394, and CardBus subsystems. The rule is successfully specified and implemented in PCI except for PCI-to-PCI bridges. As a result, a wake event cannot be propagated from a wake-capable device that is installed behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge. The operating system determines whether a function and its ancestors are wake-capable by reading the PME_Support field in the Power Management Capabilities structure to determine if the functions assert PME#, as described in the PCI Bus Power Management Interface Specification, Revision 1.1. If the operating system determines that all devices in the tree assert PME#, the operating system sets the PME_En bit to 1 for all devices in the tree.   Functions that do not support generation of PME# can hardwire the PME_En bit to 0.  PCI-to-PCI bridge manufacturers do not support generation of PME# and therefore hardwire PME_En to 0, because bridge functions generally are not intended to directly request system power state changes. With PME_En hardwired to 0, the operating system can never enable such PCI-to-PCI bridges for wake-up.  As result, wake-capable devices behind the bridge cannot wake the system.   ACPI-compliant systems running Windows can work around this problem only for PCI-to-PCI bridges on the motherboard.  ACPI BIOS vendors have intimate knowledge of motherboard design including whether PME# is physically wired from a given device to the ACPI controller and to which General Purpose Event (GPE) PME# is wired.  Based on that knowledge, the ACPI BIOS can override the power management capabilities of the bridge and report the bridge as wake-capable to the operating system, so that child devices behind that bridge can wake the system.  For bridges on add-in cards, there is no agent analogous to the ACPI BIOS that can provide override configuration data to the operating system. Therefore, devices behind a bridge on an add-in card cannot wake the system under Windows. Microsoft is investigating possible ways to address this problem in a future release of the operating system, following Windows Whistler. For information about wiring PME# to a GPE, see  GPE Routing for Microsoft Windows,  available for download at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/onnow/GPE_routing.htm  Subsystem IDs and Subsystem Vendor IDs Type 0 (Device) and Type 2 (CardBus controller) configuration headers define Subsystem and Subsystem Vendor ID but, for historical reasons, Type 1 (PCI-to-PCI bridge) configuration headers do not.  Subsystem (SSID) and Subsystem vendor IDs (SSVID) are useful because, as described in the PCI specification, they allow an operating system  to uniquely identify the expansion board or subsystem where the PCI device resides.  They provide a mechanism for expansion board vendors to distinguish their boards from one another even though the boards may have the same PCI controller on them (and, therefore, the same Vendor ID and Device ID). SIDs and SVIDs are especially useful when the operating system must apply a targeted workaround to a specific device in a specific subsystem.  Here is an example of where the lack of SIDs and SVIDs prevents the operating system from applying a targeted workaround. For example, suppose Vendor A and Vendor B both manufacture an add-in card that has two devices behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge (a very common packaging option for add-in cards).  Both vendors use PCI-to-PCI bridge XYZ on their add-in cards, so the bridge has the same Vendor ID and Device ID on both cards.  As shown in Figure 7, the card from Vendor A is correctly designed and its child devices operate as expected. However, the card from Vendor B handles secondary bus reset incorrectly and its child devices do not work.  Figure 7.  Card From Vendor B Exposes Bug in Reset of Secondary Bus Vendor B and Microsoft work together and determine that if Windows does not reset the secondary bus for bridge XYZ, Vendor B s card works properly.  However, Vendor A s card depends on the reset.  As shown in Figure 8, the workaround for Vendor B causes Vendor A s card to malfunction because it treats bridge XYZ differently. Figure 8.  Workaround for Vendor B s Card Breaks Vendor A s Card To keep both cards operating, the workaround needs to be applied to bridge XYZ on Vendor B s card but not on Vendor A s card (or any other correctly designed card that includes this bridge). For all PCI devices except bridges, the operating system can apply a targeted workaround on the basis of the device SID and SVID. Unfortunately, these IDs are not specified in the PCI Local Bus Specification, so bridges do not have them, which prevents the operating system from distinguishing between bridge XYZ on Vendor A s card and bridge XYZ on Vendor B s card. In this example, the operating system has two choices: Apply the workaround universally to bridge XYZ.  This will cause Vendor B s card to work but will break Vendor A s implementation and might break others. Do not apply the workaround to bridge XYZ, even though Vendor B s card is known to require the workaround in order to operate. The lack of SIDs and SVIDs for PCI-to-PCI bridges means that the operating system has very limited options for helping hardware vendors address bugs in PCI-to-PCI bridges that are already shipped to end users. Hardware manufacturers should design devices that include PCI-to-PCI bridges as described in this paper and the additional resources listed at the end of this paper, to avoid problems that require a targeted workaround for the bridge. PCI-to-PCI Bridges with VGA Cards VGA is a legacy technology that introduces additional challenges for PCI-to-PCI bridges because it requires good performance and requires legacy I/O ranges below 4K.  VGA is widely used, so many system configurations need the flexibility of placing VGA behind a positive decode PCI-to-PCI bridge.  Windows test teams have seen a number of system BIOSes that do not correctly configure PCI-to-PCI bridges in systems that have a VGA device behind a bridge. Specifically, these BIOSes do not correctly set the VGA Enable and ISA Enable bits on their bridges, causing the bridges to be in conflict with each other. Using the VGA Enable and ISA Enable Bits The VGA Enable bit was introduced to enable placement of VGA behind a positive-decode PCI-to-PCI bridge. However, like subtractive decode, the use of the VGA Enable bit comes with significant costs.  Figure 9 shows I/O allocation for a bridge that does not have a VGA child device and does not have the VGA Enable bit set.  Figure 9.  I/O Allocation for a Bridge Without a VGA Child Device As explained earlier in this paper, bridges receive a minimum of 4K of I/O, so the bridge in this Figure 9 receives the 4K range from 4K to 8K.  However, if a VGA device is installed behind this bridge, it also needs to pass through the legacy VGA resources (3B0-3BB for VGA monochrome and 3C0-3DF for VGA color).   When the VGA Enable bit is set, the bridge receives the standard 4K I/O window and passes through the VGA resources, which allows the VGA device behind the bridge to function.   Note:  When the VGA Enable bit was specified, it was assumed that because some VGA devices perform only a partial decode, the VGA Enable bit should also force the bridge to pass all 16-bit aliases of the VGA resources to avoid resource conflicts. Although partial address decoding introduces potential resource conflicts in many cases, it is not actually necessary to pass these aliases through the bridge.  Although a VGA device may only perform a 10-bit decode, if that device is behind a bridge, the device would never have an opportunity to claim aliases that were not passed through the bridge.  Also, most released VGA devices have not come to rely on the availability of 16-bit aliases.  However, because the bit was specified in this fashion, 16-bit aliases of VGA resources are passed through the bridge along with the VGA resources themselves.  Figure 10 shows a bridge that has the VGA Enable bit set.  Figure 10. A Bridge that Has the VGA Enable Bit Set As shown in Figure 10, this is a very inefficient use of I/O space because the 16-bit aliases of the VGA resources occur every 400h ports of I/O space.  If a bridge with the VGA Enable bit set also has a peer bridge, the problem is compounded. For example, suppose that the bridge in Figure 10 (Bridge A) has been assigned the I/O range 4K   8K and is also claiming VGA resources and aliases. The VGA aliases are spread evenly throughout I/O space. If the peer bridge (Bridge B) has been assigned an I/O window such as 8K   12K, it also claims the VGA resources and aliases that fall within its bridge window, causing a conflict with Bridge A because both bridges are attempting to decode the VGA aliases that fall in the 8K   12K range. Figure 11. Peer Bridges Claiming the Same VGA Aliases The ISA Enable bit prevents conflicts between 16-bit aliases of VGA resources (and other legacy resources) and PCI-to-PCI bridge windows.  When a bridge has the ISA Enable bit set, 16-bit aliases of 100h   3FF are blocked from passing through the bridge.  Figure 12 shows the effect of setting the ISA Enable bit for the peer bridge (Bridge B) in Figure 11. This blocks ISA aliases from passing through the bridge and prevents conflicts between bridge A and Bridge B (although it still consumes approximately 75% of the I/O range allocated to the bridge). Figure 12.  A Peer Bridge with the ISA Enable Bit Set BIOS Configuration of the VGA Enable and ISA Enable Bits To properly configure a system at boot time, the BIOS must set the VGA Enable register on all bridges that have a VGA device behind them.  This includes the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bridge, which is treated like a normal PCI-to-PCI bridge in this situation. In addition, the BIOS must set the ISA Enable bit on all bridges that are peers to bridges that have the VGA Enable bit set.  Consider what happens in the following two situations:  When a bridge does not have the ISA Enable bit set, it will decode all addresses within the bridge address window. This includes the VGA aliases, because the bridge forwards those addresses to its secondary bus. Because the bridge is decoding those addresses, the operating system allocates those addresses to the bridge. Thus, these addresses are not available for use by any other peer device, including other bridges.  When the VGA Enable bit is set, it causes the bridge to decode the legacy VGA registers and the aliases of the addresses. Because this bridge is decoding the addresses, the operating system allocates them to the bridge. Therefore, the addresses are not available for use by any other peer device, including other bridges. Because the legacy VGA registers are ISA addresses, a bridge with a VGA Enable bit set will have an I/O address conflict with any other peer bridge that does not set the ISA Enable bit. The bridge with the VGA Enable bit set would try to claim the same I/O ports (the VGA ports and aliases) that the other bridges already claim. To avoid such conflicts, bridges that are peers to a bridge with the VGA Enable bit set must have their ISA Enable bits set. Notice that the aliases in these figures occur only in the range of 0x0000   0xffff. These aliases do not continue beyond 0x10000 on 32-bit bridges. Therefore, 32-bit bridges that are peers to a bridge with its VGA Enable bit set may leave their ISA Enable bit cleared only if the I/O apertures of the 32-bit bridge are all configured above 0x10000. Video devices that have their I/O Enable bit cleared must decode only the addresses that are described by their current memory Base Address Registers.  The following figures show examples of incorrectly and correctly configured systems. Figure 13 shows the I/O address space of a system that is configured incorrectly.   Figure 13.  Incorrectly Configured Bridges The system shown in Figure 13 has two PCI-to-PCI bridges, one with its VGA Enable bit set, and a peer bridge without the ISA Enable bits set. Starting from the top of the figure: Line 1 shows the legacy VGA ports and their aliases for reference.  Line 2 shows the bridge aperture programmed into the bridge with the VGA Enable bit set.  Line 3 shows that when the VGA bit is set, this bridge not only decodes the addresses within that aperture, but the VGA ports and all their aliases.  Line 4 shows the I/O aperture programmed into the peer bridge.  This bridge does not have its ISA Enable bit set, so the bridge will decode all addresses within that aperture. But, as shown in line 3, the other bridge is already decoding some of these addresses. The vertical bars in Figure 13 show how the bridge with the VGA Enable bit set is in conflict with the bridge without the ISA Enable bit set on eight I/O ranges. Figure 14 shows the same system configured correctly. Figure 14.  Correctly Configured Bridges In Figure 14, the second bridge has the ISA Enable bit set. Lines 1, 2, and 3 are identical to those shown in Figure 13. Notice that in line 4, the second bridge does not decode every address within its aperture; it decodes only those addresses that are not ISA addresses. This creates holes in the I/O space so that the two bridges are no longer in conflict. The following figures show bus topologies for both correctly and incorrectly configured systems. Figure 15 shows a correctly configured system.  Figure 15.  A System with Correctly Configured PCI-to-PCI Bridges The system shown in Figure 15 is configured as follows: Only one of the three PCI-to-PCI bridges attached to the CPU-to-PCI bridge has its VGA Enable bit set; the other two peer bridges have their ISA Enabled bits set. On the left side of the figure, the two PCI-to-PCI bridges are also configured correctly: One bridge has its VGA Enable bit set, and the other bridge has its ISA Enabled bits set. The two remaining PCI-to-PCI bridges have their ISA Enabled bits clear because their peer devices (a VGA device and a network adapter) are not bridges and their resources will not conflict with the resources assigned to the bridges. Figure 16 shows a simpler system that is also correctly configured. Figure 16.  A System With Correctly Configured AGP and PCI-to-PCI Bridges As in Figure 15, the three bridges attached to the CPU-to-PCI bridge are correctly configured. In the case of Figure 16, the AGP bridge has its VGA Enable bit set, and its peer bridges have their ISA Enabled bits set. Also, the PCI-to-PCI bridge that is a peer of the network adapter correctly has its ISA Enabled bit clear, because the network adapter cannot conflict with bridge resources. Figure 17 shows the same system as in Figure 15, except the bridges are configured incorrectly. Figure 17.  Incorrectly Configured Bridges  The bridges in the system shown in Figure 17 would incorrectly decode addresses in the VGA alias range. Figure 18 shows the same system as in Figure 17, partially corrected. Figure 18.  Incorrectly Configured Bridges One bridge in this system has its ISA Enable bit cleared, so it would decode addresses in VGA alias range that belong to the peer bridge that has its VGA Enable bit set. Summary of Attributes of CardBus Controllers and PCI-to-PCI Bridges Table 1 summarizes some of the relevant similarities and differences between CardBus controllers and PCI-to-PCI bridges that should be considered when designing devices that include PCI-to-PCI bridges or CardBus controllers.

Hardware manufacturers should: Understand resource requirements of their devices and the hierarchical nature of resource allocation in Windows Design devices to use memory space rather than I/O space as much as possible, because memory space is much less constrained. Understand how resources are allocated to their devices in cold boot and hot-plug scenarios Make sure BIOSes configure all bridges in the system as required for all child devices to receive sufficient resources Do not rely on BIOS code to run after a hot-plug event.  BIOS code only runs during cold boot and resume from S4. Avoid designs such as those described in this article that would require the operating system to change bridge configurations at runtime in order to start devices.  For example, do not place legacy resource consuming devices behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge.  This includes not placing CardBus controllers behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge because a legacy resource consuming device (an R2 card the requires legacy I/O) can be plugged into the CardBus slot Design CardBus controllers to pass Type 1 (PCI-to-PCI bridge) configuration cycles through the controller so the operating system can configure PCI-to-PCI bridges behind the controller. Hardware manufacturers should ensure PME# is wired correctly and override power capabilities of bridges as required to ensure that wake-capable devices behind onboard bridges can wake the system.  Remember that PCI-to-PCI bridges do not have subsystem and subsystem vendor IDs, which prevents the operating system from applying workarounds based on the presence of a particular bridge in a particular subsystem or on a particular add-in card. Follow the directions provided in this paper for setting VGA Enable and ISA Enable bits on PCI-to-PCI bridges.

All preinstallation instructions and tools referenced in this document and in the online Microsoft  Windows  OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) User s Guide are intended for use by OEMs and may not be disclosed or distributed to end users. You must comply with the requirements outlined in the OPK User s Guide, which can be found on the Windows OPK CD. A Windows OPK CD is included in every 3-pack of Windows XP obtained through an authorized distributor. You can also find the OPK User s Guide at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=5858. You must also comply with the terms of the System Builder Microsoft Distribution and Preinstallation Agreement and the OEM license agreement. Benefits of Using the OEM Preinstallation Kit By using the OEM Preinstallation Kit, you can: Save valuable time by using a configuration set instead of manually answering questions in Windows Setup. Deliver a ready-to-use, built-to-order system by preinstalling and testing all programs and applications, including updated drivers and patches. Customize the Windows XP Windows Welcome screen to display your OEM logo and company name. Include shortcuts to preinstalled applications on the Most Frequently Used (MFU) list of applications on the Windows XP Start menu. Add a link to OEM-specific information on the Windows XP Start menu. Include a link to your company s Web site in the Microsoft Internet Explorer Favorites. Terminology and Concepts To understand this Step-by-Step Guide better, familiarize yourself with the following terms and concepts. Definition answer file A script that answers the command prompts in Windows Setup and that makes additional configuration changes in Windows. configuration set The complete collection of files, drivers, applications, patches, and answer files that you install with Windows. You can duplicate a configuration set and then edit it for each different computer model that you ship. destination computers (optional) Multiple computers on which you apply the same image that you created on the master computer and which will be sold or distributed to customers. distribution share A network share that contains the source files and possibly custom answer files for a Windows product that you plan to preinstall. end user The person who receives the computer that is manufactured by the OEM. image A collection of files and folders (sometimes compressed into one file) that duplicates the original file and folder structure of an operating system. It often contains other files added by the OEM or corporation. master computer A fully-assembled computer containing a master installation that you can copy to destination computers. master installation A customized installation of Windows that you can duplicate onto one or more destination computers. network preinstallation A preinstallation method that uses at least two computers (including a technician computer as the main data store and a master computer for the preinstallation), a configuration set, and a Winbom.ini file. Setup Manager A wizard that helps you create and modify answer files and configuration sets. stand-alone preinstallation  A preinstallation method of using a single, stand-alone computer, the Windows product CD, and a Winnt.sif or Unattend.txt file without using a configuration set or technician computer as your main data store. If you use this limited method, you will have to preinstall manually.  Sysprep A tool that prepares the hard disk on a master computer for duplication to destination computers. technician computer A computer connected to a network on which you build configuration sets with Setup Manager. This computer contains configuration sets, Windows Welcome customizations, preinstalled/staged applications, patches, fixes, service packs, the System Preparation tool (Sysprep), and imaging software. The technician computer usually contains the distribution share and the OPK documentation. Unattend.txt The generic name for the Windows Setup answer file. In the CD boot preinstallation method, Unattend.txt must be named Winnt.sif. Windows XP 3-Pack  The package that contains three CDs of Windows XP Home Edition or Windows XP Professional, plus the Windows OPK CD. If you do not receive a Windows OPK CD, please contact the distributor who sold you the product. Benefits of Using a Network for Preinstallation The following table presents the advantages and disadvantages of two methods of preinstallation: Networked Preinstallation Non-Networked Preinstallation from CD Fast, especially on a high-speed network and with a fast network interface card. Slow. Windows Setup must read from the CD-ROM drive without caching. Requires a LAN or other network connection. Does not require a LAN or other network connection. Requires more work in advance to configure the network environment, but allows more flexibility in the manufacturing environment. It is significantly easier to create build-to-order computers. Requires less preparation in advance. Enables you to start the computer by using the Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) located on the Windows OPK CD. A floppy disk containing a Winnt.sif file is required. Enables you to add drivers to the hard disk by using the path specified in the OemPnPDriversPath entry in Unattend.txt. Restricts third-party drivers only to mass-storage devices. You must load these drivers by pressing F6 during the first boot of the operating system. Enables you to use a configuration set. You can update drivers and use the Winbom.ini file to automate preinstalling applications. You can also customize particular files in the Windows installation by placing them in the correct location in the $OEM$ structure. Does not enable you to gain access to a configuration set to customize or brand the Windows installation. Less flexibility in customization. Enables you to auto-partition or format the hard drive before Setup starts by using the [DiskConfig] section in Winbom.ini. Does not enable you to auto-partition or format the hard drive if it is not already formatted. Enables you to perform a true unattended Setup. May require user input for partitioning and formatting the hard disk. By using the Windows PE network-based preinstallation method, you gain the following additional benefits: Save valuable time by automating the entire preinstallation process. Fully automate network connectivity in a 32-bit environment. Automate partitioning and formatting of the target hard drive, including native NTFS support and the ability to read NTFS file shares from Windows PE. Automate copying of the entire i386 folder to the target computer (in C:\Windows). Automate copying of custom OEM logos and the Oeminfo.ini file to the master installation. Enable preinstallation of applications using the Winbom.ini file, and enable installation of hot fixes or service patches from one location using the technician computer. Automatically process the [Factory] section of Winbom.ini on boot into Windows Audit mode. Add your OEM link and prepopulate up to three Most Frequently Used (MFU) shortcuts on the Start menu. Automatically add customized Internet Explorer branding, including a search page, custom toolbar buttons, a custom home page, as well as additional customized Favorites and Help and Support pages. Automatically copy and execute Sysrep.exe. Automatically start Audit mode. In addition, if you do network installations, you do not need to open all CDs from the 3-pack because the source files are copied from one CD (one each for Home Edition or Professional) to your technician computer only once. You should ship the remaining unopened packs with each new computer that you preinstall by using the configuration set you built. While a network-based process is the recommended approach, it is possible to perform a CD-based preinstallation without a network. For information on this process, refer to Appendix For information on enabling Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 or Windows XP for use with Windows PE, see the following Knowledge Base article: http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q310/8/16.asp. Overview of the Preinstallation Process Before you begin, set up one of the following configurations (listed in order of preference). A technician computer that contains one network adapter, plus a network router or a server running Windows .NET that is configured as a DHCP server. In addition, you need a master computer that also contains one network adapter. This option gives you the maximum preinstallation flexibility. A technician computer that contains two network adapters or a network adapter and a modem. With this configuration, you can use Internet Connection Sharing (ICS), which acts as a simple DHCP server. Your technician computer must be running Windows XP. In addition, you need a master computer that also contains one network adapter. A technician computer that contains one network adapter, plus a crossover cable to connect to a master computer that also contains one network adapter. You can preinstall Windows without using a network; however, you lose considerable flexibility in doing so. For information on this option, see Appendix Non-Networked Preinstallation from CD. The last two configurations do not give you the option of using DHCP. As discussed elsewhere in this document, not using DHCP makes your preinstallation process more complex. For more information, see  Benefits of Using a Network for Preinstallation. Complete the following steps to prepare a computer for your customer. For a visual representation of this process, see the illustration that appears after these steps: Prepare the new hardware and software: Assemble the hardware for the computers that you will distribute to your customer. Identify any additional drivers and applications that you want to install. Prepare the technician computer: Install the OEM Preinstallation Kit ( the OPK Tools Copy any applications to a local folder or network share that you can access later. Run Setup Manager to build a configuration set. Select the Create Windows Preinstall Environment floppy check box when saving the configuration set. Selecting this check box copies a modified version of the Winbom.ini file to a floppy disk. (Winbom.ini is an answer file that guides the installation and configuration process.) Prepare the master computer: Boot the master computer with the Windows OPK CD. Insert the Windows PE floppy disk containing the Winbom.ini file when the computer starts. Install the operating system and restart into Factory mode. Audit (configure and test) the computer in Factory mode. Prepare the computer for the end user by running Sysprep  reseal or by using the following Winbom.ini setting: [Factory] Reseal = Yes. Configure the destination computers (optional): Build an image of the master installation and store the image on the technician computer (or elsewhere on your network). Start from the floppy disk of your preferred imaging software or from the Windows PE CD. Restore the image over the network to the destination computers. (Or copy the image from the technician computer onto the destination computers.) Alternatively, you can burn a CD containing the image and imaging software, and use this CD to start and configure the destination computers. The Preinstallation Process Preparing the New Hardware and Software Make sure that your hardware components display the Designed for Microsoft Windows logo and that the hardware is listed on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft Web site (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3239). Set up the new hardware and software, and identify any applications that you want to install. Preparing the Technician Computer To prepare the technician computer, you must install the OEM Preinstallation Kit ( the OPK Tools ), preinstall any applications (including the architecture-specific applications that your customer has requested), and then run Setup Manager to build a configuration set.  You can use either the Windows XP SP1 OPK or the Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK to preinstall the following versions of Windows: Original "gold" release of Windows XP  Windows XP SP1  Windows .NET Server 2003 family  Do not use the original "gold" release of Windows XP OPK to preinstall Windows XP SP1 or the Windows .NET Server 2003 family. Installing the OEM Preinstallation Kit To install the OEM Preinstallation Kit Purchase a 3-pack of Windows XP Professional SP1 (or Windows XP Home Edition SP1) from an authorized distributor. Remove the Windows OPK CD from the box and insert it into the CD-ROM drive of the technician computer. The first screen of the Microsoft Windows OEM Preinstallation Kit will appear. Click Install Windows OEM Preinstallation Kit. You can install the OPK only on a computer running Windows 2000 or Windows If the CD does not start automatically, double-click Setup.exe in the root folder of the Windows OPK CD. Accept the default settings as you complete the OPK Setup Wizard. Upgrading from Previous Versions of the OPK You can upgrade from the original   Windows XP OPK tools to the Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) or the Windows .NET Server 2003 family version of the OPK tools.  Only one version of the OPK tools and documentation can be installed on a technician computer. If you previously installed the OPK from the original "gold" release of Windows XP, you must upgrade those tools to the Windows XP SP1 OPK or the Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK; OPK tools from the original "gold" release of Windows XP cannot coexist on the technician computer with Windows XP SP1 or Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK. To upgrade the OPK Tools from the   release of Windows XP to Windows XP SP1 Run Opk.msi, located at the root of the Windows XP SP1 OPK CD. This is the autorun file, which automatically starts when you insert the CD. When the Welcome to the Windows OEM Preinstallation Kit page appears, click Next. Upgrading Existing Configuration Sets When you upgrade to the Windows XP SP1 OPK or the Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK, no changes are made to any existing configuration sets, located in the \Cfgsets folder. Also, when you upgrade to the Windows XP SP1 OPK or the Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK, no changes are made to any available Windows product files, located in the \Lang folder.  You must use the Product page in Setup Manager to load the Windows product files for the newer versions of Windows, such as Windows XP SP1 or members of the Windows .NET Server 2003 family. Upgrading to the Windows XP SP1 OPK or the Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK updates the template files that Setup Manager uses when creating a new configuration set. Any new configuration sets created with the Windows XP SP1 or the Windows .NET Server 2003 Setup Manager will use the new default values. To migrate a Windows XP configuration set to preinstall Windows XP SP1 Open the configuration set in the Windows XP SP1 version of Setup Manager, update the SKU (version), and save the configuration set. Manually edit the Winbom.ini file to point to the $OEM$ folder for the new SKU. The preferred method is to use Setup Manager. To migrate a Windows XP configuration set to preinstall a product in the Windows .NET Server 2003 family Open the configuration set in the Windows .NET Server 2003 version of Setup Manager, update the SKU (version), and save the configuration set. Manually edit the Winbom.ini file to point to the $OEM$ folder for the new SKU. The preferred method is to use Setup Manager. You can also install Windows XP SP1 as a separate product on the same technician computer where your   release of Windows XP is located. When you use this method, your existing configuration sets still work. To incorporate Windows XP SP1 into a pre-existing Windows XP configuration set Copy the contents of the Windows XP SP1 update CD to a subdirectory on your technician computer. For example, create a folder under the OPKTools directory called Updates. Place the files from the Windows XP SP1 CD in the Updates folder. Run Setup Manager. Open an existing configuration set that you used to install the original   release of Windows XP. On the Product page, select the original   release of Windows XP. On the Preinstalled Applications page, add the following command line: Executable:  HYPERLINK "\\\\Technician_Computer\\Opktools\\Updates\\Xpsp1.exe" \\Technician_Computer\Opktools\Updates\Xpsp1.exe Parameters: /q /n /z Save the configuration set and complete Setup Manager as you normally would. If you set up a distribution share with OPK tools from the original   Windows XP release, the Guest account is enabled. Setting up a distribution share with Windows .NET Server 2003 OPK tools does not enable the Guest account. Upgrade doesn't change the properties of an existing distribution share. Upgrading Toolkits Installed for Multiple Languages If you have installed multiple language versions of the OPK from the original "gold" release of Windows XP, you must upgrade each language version of the tools separately. The first time you upgrade the OPK toolkit, the OPK installation program automatically detects and upgrades the set of tools in the corresponding language. You must upgrade the OPK tools for each additional language separately, by using that language version of the Windows OPK CD. Sharing the OPKTools and Application Folders Make sure that your OPKTools folder and any folders containing applications that you want to install are shared and that you have created appropriate user accounts to access them. To share a folder, right-click it, click Sharing and Security, and then click Share this folder. After you run Setup Manager and create your first configuration set, you can share the OPKTools folder if you have not already done so. Creating User Accounts for Preinstallation To create new user accounts in Windows XP Professional (when joined to a domain) On the Start menu, click Control Panel, click Performance and Maintenance, click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management. Double-click Local Users and Groups, right-click Users, and then select New User. Type a new user name and password that you will use during the application preinstallation phase. To create new user accounts in Windows XP Professional (in a workgroup) or Windows XP Home Edition On the Start menu, click Control Panel, click User Accounts, and then click Create a new account. On the Name the new account page, type a name, and then click Next. On the Pick an account type page, select Computer administrator, and then click Create Account. Important For the preinstallation to work properly, you must share the OPKTools and application folders, and then create user accounts for accessing them. For example, use the user name opkuser and a password for the OPKTools folder; and use the user name appuser and a password for the applications folder. Installing Step by Step Interactive Manually To install the English version of Step by Step Interactive (SBSI) for Windows XP Home Edition Run the following command: \\ComputerName\OPKTools\Lang\Eng\SBSI\Per\Setup\Setup.exe -SMS -S -f1\\ComputerName\OPKTools\Lang\Eng\SBSI\Per\Setup\Silent.iss To install the English version of SBSI for Windows XP Professional Edition Run the following command: \\ComputerName\OPKTools\Lang\Eng\SBSI\Pro\Setup\Setup.exe -SMS -S -f1\\ComputerName\OPKTools\Lang\Eng\SBSI\Pro\Setup\Silent.iss Running Setup Manager to Build a Configuration Set After you have installed the OPK, you are ready to run Setup Manager, the wizard that can help you create a configuration set. To start Setup Manager Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Windows Preinstallation Kit, and then click Setup Manager. Double-click the Setupmgr.exe file in the root folder where you installed the OEM Preinstallation Kit. The first page of Setup Manager will appear. Welcome to Setup Manager The Setup Manager screens in Windows XP Service Pack 1 differ slightly from those in the   release of Windows XP. However, the functionality is the same. On the first page of Setup Manager, you can prepare the automated preinstallation of Windows XP on your destination computers (the computers that you will sell to your customer). Setup Manager will save the settings that you choose in a configuration set. To avoid seeing this page the next time you run Setup Manager, select the Skip this page next time check box. When you are ready to continue, click Next. Configuration Set On this page, create a new configuration set, or edit or copy an existing one. Because this is your first time running Setup Manager, you can choose to create a new configuration set. Later, if you decide to run Setup Manager again, you can select the configuration set that you ve already created and make additional changes to it. To create a new configuration set Click Create a new configuration set, and then click Next. To modify an existing configuration set Click Edit or copy an existing configuration set. In the Existing configuration sets list, click the configuration set that you want to use, and then click Next. Type of Installation On this page, choose one of the following three installation types: t reseal when finished: This default installation mode is for a single-language installation with auditing set to automatic. If you select this option, you must download the source files and run Windows Setup. Completing this type of installation does not reseal the computer. The computer restarts into Audit mode. Reseal when finished: Based on the above installation mode, this mode automatically reseals the computer without enabling further customization. To enable further customization after restart, select Factory. To restart into the default end-user experience (either Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup, depending on the version of Windows that you install), select End user. Copy files only: This installation mode provides you access to the command prompt after the file-copying portion of Setup finishes and before first-boot processing occurs. You have the option of disk duplication and other customization. By default, auditing is not set in this mode. Resealing is the last step in the preinstallation process. It prepares the computer for delivery to the end user and sets the computer to start into either Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup (depending upon the Windows product that you install). You are required to reseal the computer before delivering it to the end user. Location of Settings The settings from this page are saved in this location: Winbom.ini [Factory] Reseal ResealMode Product On this page, select the Windows product that you want to install. To specify the target product If the product that you want to install is located on the Windows product CD, insert the CD, click Add, and then double-click the CD-ROM drive. In the Products list, select the product that you want to install, and then click Next. Setup Manager will copy the product files to your computer. Location of Settings The settings from this page are saved in this location: Winbom.ini [WinPe] OEM Branding Information On this page, specify branding information. When the destination computer runs Windows XP, branding information appears automatically in Control Panel, on the General tab of the System Properties dialog box. To specify your branding information In the Manufacturer box, type your manufacturer name. This is required information. In the Model box, type the model of the computer. This is optional information. In the Provide information on how your customers can get support box, type how the end user can obtain support. This is required information. Follow these guidelines for specifying your branding information: Spell all items exactly the way you want the text to appear in the product. Include telephone numbers and hours of operation for your technical support group. Add a URL for the technical information page of your company Web site and/or an e-mail address for technical support. Include information for several countries or regions with a common language and different support information. Do not list Microsoft in the support information section you are responsible for supporting Windows XP on all computers that your company ships. Localize the required [Support Information] section in Oeminfo.ini for each language in which you ship your product. Microsoft includes only an English (U.S.) sample in this OPK. Do not include any information, such as the version number of the Windows XP operating system that could change when the end user upgrades to the next version. Do not include any information in the [Support Information] section that does not directly pertain to support. Location of Settings The settings from this page are saved in this location: Oeminfo.ini [General] Manufacturer Model [Support Information] LineXX Unattend.txt Product Key Use this page to provide a Product Key for the destination computers. To specify the Product Key In the Product Key boxes, type the Product Key that came with the version of Windows that you want to install. This Product Key will be set to blank when you reseal the computer for final shipment to the customer. Notes The Product Key setting is saved in the unattended installation file if you use Unattend.txt.  You must use a Windows XP Professional Product Key to install Windows XP Professional, and a Windows XP Home Edition Product Key to install Windows XP Home Edition. Location of Settings The settings from this page are saved in this location: [UserData] ProductKey Preinstalled Applications Use this page to define entries that start application setup programs or .inf scripts during the auditing process. The steps that you complete to preinstall other programs will differ depending on the program. To specify the programs to start during auditing On the Preinstalled Applications page, click Add. The Add an Application dialog box will appear. In the Add an Application dialog box, in the Display name box, type the name of the application as you want it to appear in the user interface. In the Setup command box, specify the location of the application s setup program as you want it to appear in Winbom.ini. If you want to specify a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path, click Browse to find the location of the Windows Setup program in a folder on a mapped network drive or a local folder that is shared. For example, if you browse to a shared folder located in D:\apps\program\setup.exe on a computer named Computer1, the entry appears as \\Computer1\apps\program\setup.exe. If you browse to a folder that is not shared, the entry appears as D:\apps\program\setup.exe. If you want to specify a drive path, type the complete path to the setup program. For example:  D:\apps\program\setup.exe. This command line sets up that program to run during auditing. The Standard installation mode automatically invokes auditing during the Windows XP preinstallation. In the Command line arguments box, type any switches or parameters required to run the application s setup program. Click Advanced if you want to specify the type of setup program, restart the computer after installing, or select staging options. Staging an application: If you want to install a particular application on most of your computers, consider including a staged version of the application in the master installation. To stage an application means to make all the files available locally. When an application is staged on the hard drive, the application setup program is required only to make the relevant changes in the registry, eliminating time-consuming copying of files. On the Preinstalled Applications screen, you can also edit the preload parameters by selecting the item on the list and then clicking Edit. You can also change the order in which the setup programs run by selecting an item and clicking the arrow buttons to the right of the list to move that item. To specify network access credentials for this configuration set only Select the Specify credentials for connection to network resources in Factory mode check box. Type the User name, including a domain name if needed (for example, domain/UserName). Type the password in the Password and Confirm password boxes. Important Type the user name and password that you created earlier for the application preinstallation phase (for example, appuser). Specifying credentials for this configuration set does not change the credentials specified in the distribution share settings. If you do not specify credentials for this configuration set, Setup Manager uses those specified in the distribution share settings. You can view or change the distribution share settings by clicking the Tools menu, and then clicking Distribution Share. Example:  The following [OemRunOnce] section of a Winbom.ini file preinstalls Microsoft Office XP in quiet mode (a silent installation without manual input), along with an Office XP Service Pack and Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP. To set up the installation of Plus! for Windows XP, you must click Advanced and then specify the .msi file. You must use the /qb and /wait parameters or Setup will not wait until the installation finishes before running the next command listed in the [OemRunOnce] section. For example: [OemRunOnce] "Office XP","""\\ComputerName\cd1\Setup.exe"" /qb /wait addlocal=all pidkey=pidhere" "Office Service Pack","""\\ComputerName\ServicePack\oxpsp1.exe"" " "Installing Step by Step Interactive","""\\NTOPKV2\whistleropk\lang\ENG\sbsi\pro\setup\setup.exe"" -SMS -S -f1""\\NTOPKV2\whistleropk\lang\ENG\sbsi\pro\setup\silent.iss""" For an English installation, Setup Manager automatically adds the  Installing Step by Step Interactive  to the Winbom.ini section if any applications are preinstalled. You will see this only if you look at the Winbom.ini [OemRunOnce] section. Make sure that all of your folders are shared and that the user account that you created has access to the shares. In this case, the user name appuser has permission to access the \cd1 and \ServicePack application folders. Important If you assign a static IP address, applications are not preinstalled, even though they are specified in the Winbom.ini file, because the network configuration works only while Windows PE is running. In particular, Step by Step Interactive (SBSI) will not install, and it is a requirement of the OEM licensing agreement that SBSI be installed for Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you use DHCP to assign IP addresses automatically. For instructions on installing SBSI manually, see  Installing Step by Step Interactive Manually,  earlier in this document. Location of Settings The settings from this page are saved in this location: Winbom.ini [OEMRunOnce] The [OEMRunOnce] section contains multiple entries that configure application preinstallation. See the Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Reference (Ref.chm) for more information. [Factory] Password UserName Logo Information You can display your company logo in System Properties in Control Panel. On this page, specify the logo file that you want to use. To specify a custom logo for System Properties Create a bitmap file named Oemlogo.bmp that contains your company logo. The bitmap must be 172 100 pixels in size. Place the file in the $OEM$\$$\System32 subfolder of the configuration set. On the Logo Information page, select the Display the following logo in System Properties check box. Specify the path and file name for the logo bitmap. It is strongly recommended that you test your logo bitmap on the computer models and monitors that you ship to ensure that the logo appears the way you want. Location of Settings The settings are stored in the [LogoFiles] section of the Cfgbatch.txt file for the configuration set. Setup Manager saves the Oemlogo.bmp file to OPKTools\Cfgsets\configsetname\$Oem$\$$\System32. Windows Setup copies the .bmp file to the %WINDIR%\System32 folder on the destination computer. Branding Opportunities On this page, customize the Windows Welcome screen with your own branding. You can do this in two ways: Add your company name to the Welcome and Finish pages. Add a logo to appear in the upper-right corner of the Windows Welcome pages. To customize Windows Welcome Type your company name in the Company Name box exactly as you want it to appear on the Welcome and Finish pages. Select the Add the following OEM logo to Windows Welcome check box, and then click Browse to specify the path and file name of the graphic file that you want to display. Your logo will appear in the upper-right corner of the Windows Welcome pages. It is recommended that you prepare the logo graphic before you run Setup Manager. You can use any of the following graphics formats: BMP, JPG, PNG, and GIF. Other requirements are noted in the table below. Location of logo display Location of settings Bitmap size and color depth Windows Welcome (OOBE) Oobeinfo.ini 40 pixels 256 colors If the image is larger than the specified dimension, Windows Welcome crops any additional pixels on the right-hand side or bottom of the image.

In addition, the Windows installation files are now copied to the distribution share that you specified. To complete Setup Manager Click the Close button in the top right corner of the wizard page. Specifying the Location of the Distribution Share After you click Finish, the Distribution Share dialog box will appear. If you already have a configuration set, this dialog box will not appear. To specify the location of the distribution share Type the network path of the distribution share. This is usually located on the technician computer. Select either Use the Guest account or Use the following account. If you chose to use an account other than Guest, type the user name and password that you want to use to connect to the share (for example, the opkuser account that you created earlier). Configuring DHCP Addresses for a Network Preinstallation To configure DHCP addresses for a network preinstallation Make sure that the technician computer has two network adapters or a network adapter and a modem. Make sure that the master computer has a compatible network adapter to complete the connection to the technician computer. Your network adapter must be on the hardware compatibility list at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3239. Enable Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on the network adapter or modem in the technician computer that is not connected to the master computer network. All computers in a network environment using DHCP automatically receive IP addresses, and DHCP is enabled by default. There is no need to share the OPKTools folder before running Setup Manager for the first time. By default, Setup Manager prompts you to share the folder automatically. For more information, see Knowledge Base article Q310816 at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=5859. Configuring a Static Address for Peer-to-Peer Preinstallation  To complete a preinstallation in a peer-to-peer networked scenario, you must modify the TCP/IP information manually in the Winbom.ini file so that you can connect to the technician computer by using a crossover cable or a hub and two standard network cables. A crossover cable is usually an orange cable that is used to interconnect two computers by "crossing over" (reversing) most of their respective pin contacts. A crossover cable is sometimes known as a null modem cable. First, make sure that all of the computers are in the same workgroup. The technician computer automatically receives an IP address if it is located in the workgroup. If, for some reason, the technician computer does not automatically receive an IP address, you can assign a static IP address manually. Assigning Static IP Addresses Manually To assign static IP addresses manually On the Start menu of the technician computer, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet Connections, and then click Network Connections. Right-click the connection, and then click Properties. Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), click Properties, click Use the following IP address, and enter the following static IP address information: IP Address = 169.172.0.1 Subnet Mask = 255.255.0.0 Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes and save the settings. On the master computer, open the Winbom.ini file on the floppy disk by using Notepad. Add the following parameters and values to the [WinPE.net] section: [WinPE.net] StartNet = Yes Ipconfig = 169.172.0.2 Subnetmask = 255.255.0.0 Save the Winbom.ini file. After you have changed the TCP/IP properties for the technician and master computers, insert the floppy disk that was created by Setup Manager into the master computer s floppy disk drive. Insert the Windows OPK CD in the master computer s CD-ROM drive and restart the master computer. If prompted, press any key to start from the CD. Using the Winbom.ini file in the master installation, Windows will connect to the technician computer and begin the preinstallation. The hard drive on the master computer will be repartitioned and reformatted. When the installation finishes, the master computer restarts in Audit mode. Remove the floppy disk when the computer restarts. Preparing the Master Installation To prepare the master installation Start the computer with the Windows OPK CD or with a Windows PE CD that you create. Insert the Winbom.ini floppy disk at startup. Reseal the master installation. Run Sysprep in Audit or Factory mode to modify and then reseal the installation. Build an image of the master installation and store that image on the technician computer. Preinstalling Hot Fixes The following procedure describes how to preinstall hot fixes for Windows XP. This process differs slightly from the implementation for Windows 2000, in that there are a few extra steps required to register the hot fix. To install a hot fix Rename the hot fix package to a suitable 8.3 file name. This is required because Windows XP Setup does not recognize long file names. For example: REN Q308387_WXP_SP1_X86_JPN.EXE Q308387.EXE Make a temporary folder to hold the extracted contents of the hot fix package. The files within the package replace the original files in the i386 folder: MD C:\Temp Extract the files from the hot fix package. For example:  Q308387.EXE /x Enter C:\Temp for the name of the folder.  Using Notepad, edit \Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Dosnet.inf. Add the following information to the file: [OptionalSrcDirs]  svcpack Delete the svpack.in_ and original file(s) that the hot fix replaces. For example: DEL Svcpack.in__ DEL Autolfn.exe_ Copy the replacement file from the temporary folder to the i386 folder: COPY C:\Temp\Autolfn.exe C:\Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Autolfn.exe Create a Svcpack folder in \Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386. Create a new \Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Svcpack.inf: [Version] Signature = "$Windows NT$" BuildNumber = 2600 MajorVersion = 5 MinorVersion = 1 [SetupData] CatalogSubDir = "i386\svcpack" [ProductCatalogsToInstall] sp1.cat [SetupHotfixesToRun] Q308387.exe /q /n /z Copy Sp1.cat from C:\Temp\Update to the C:\Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Svcpack folder: COPY C:\Temp\Update\Sp1.cat C:\Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Svcpack\Sp1.cat Copy Q308387.exe to the C:\Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Svcpack folder: COPY Q308387.EXE C:\Opktools\Lang\JPN\SKU\Pro\x86\i386\Svcpack\Q308387.exe Using the Windows Preinstallation Environment The Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) provides the following benefits: A hardware-independent Windows environment A subset of the Win32 API Network access and support for standard network drivers Support for all mass-storage devices that use Windows 2000 or Windows XP drivers Support for creating, deleting, formatting, and managing NTFS file system partitions The ability to run hardware diagnostics Support for the PXE protocol The Windows OPK CD is a Windows PE CD. You can use it to start a computer into the Windows Preinstallation Environment. You can also create a Windows PE CD by following the instructions in the OPK User s Guide. Resealing or Customizing the Master installation Now you can either reseal the computer if you are ready to deliver it to the customer, or you can make more customizations by running Sysprep in Audit or Factory mode. Customizing the Installation Make manual changes to any answer files, manually copy additional drivers to the distribution share, and so on. For example, you can add driver files such as .sys and .cab files to the $OEM$\$1 folder, and then add the path to the driver files in the [OEMPnPDrivers] section of Unattend.txt. Using Answer Files As a best practice, it is recommended that you install Windows XP from a distribution share by using an answer file. This helps to ensure consistency in configuring the master installation, so that you can create and test iterative builds more readily. Types of Answer Files Various answer files are used for various purposes and with various tools. For a detailed description of the contents of each answer file, see the OPK User s Guide. A brief summary of Winbom.ini and Unattend.txt follows. Winbom.ini Winbom.ini specifies a "bill of materials" for the Factory tool to use when updating a master installation. To use the Factory tool, run Sysprep -factory. After locating a Winbom.ini file, the Factory tool reads the value of the WinbomType entry in the [Factory] section. If the value of WinbomType is not appropriate in this context, the Winbom.ini file is ignored and the Factory tool continues searching for a Winbom.ini file. If the value of WinbomType is appropriate in this context, the Factory tool reads the value of the NewWinbom entry in the [Factory] section. If a value is specified for NewWinbom, and a Winbom.ini file is located in that location, the Factory tool examines that Winbom.ini file for a NewWinbom entry. This cycle continues a maximum of 10 times or until the Factory tool locates a Winbom.ini file that does not contain a NewWinbom entry, whichever occurs first. The Factory tool then continues to run, using the settings in the last identified Winbom.ini file. If you apply the SBSI patch, you must manually edit the Winbom.ini file in your configuration set and move the SBSI installation line so that it precedes the line that installs the patch. If you use Setup Manager to re-edit Winbom.ini, you must make this change again. For detailed information, see the following Knowledge Base article: http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q309/2/48.asp. Unattend.txt The answer file for Setup is commonly called Unattend.txt, but for a network preinstallation, you can name the file anything you like. For a CD-based Setup, the answer file must be named Winnt.sif. Unattend.txt (or Winnt.sif) tells Setup how to interact with the distribution shares and files that you create and supplies Setup with all of the information that the end user is prompted to provide during a typical Windows Setup. For example, the answer file contains a FullName entry in the [UserData] section. For more information about answer files, see the OPK User s Guide. Customizing Mini-Setup or Windows Welcome The first time you start a computer in end-user mode either Mini-Setup or Windows Welcome runs. The purpose of these first-run experiences is to gather user configuration information that is not already present on the destination computer. Mini-Setup is a subset of Windows Setup. Mini-Setup prompts for user-specific information, detects new hardware, and regenerates system IDs. Windows Welcome is the end user's first experience of Microsoft Windows in Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional. Through a series of full-screen HTML-based pages, Windows Welcome quickly and easily guides end users through the final steps of setting up their personal computer. Windows Welcome prompts end users for additional information needed to personalize their settings, which can include regional settings, network configuration (where applicable), and Internet connection settings. While Windows Welcome is the default first-run experience for Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional, Mini-Setup is the default first-run experience for the Windows .NET Server 2003 family. To run Mini-Setup instead of Windows Welcome in Windows XP Professional, use the  mini parameter in Sysprep. For more information about running Sysprep, see the following section. Using Sysprep After performing the initial setup steps on a single computer, you can run Sysprep to prepare the master installation for cloning. Sysprep is a tool designed for corporate system administrators, OEMs, and others who need to deploy Windows XP on multiple computers. Sysprep runs in three modes, which you access by using different parameters on the command line or in the Sysprep user interface. Each mode is used for a different purpose: Restart into the installed operating system using Sysprep -factory (or by clicking the Factory button) to make additional changes and customizations. Run Sysprep -audit (or click the Audit button) to test the final installation. Run Sysprep -reseal (or click the Reseal button) to prepare the computer for the end user and shut it down. Important You are limited to three reseals of the operating system when using Sysprep. For more information, see  Limiting Reseals in Sysprep  later in this document. When deploying Windows XP, completely install the operating system and preconfigure the shell and applications as required. You can then use Sysprep to enable user-specific customization when the computer is delivered or set up for the user. In this case, the first time the end user starts the computer, Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup prompts the user for a minimal amount of information. After you finish the first-run experience, the installation deletes the Sysprep folder from the hard disk. Sysprep assigns a unique security ID (SID) to each destination computer the first time you restart the computer. Sysprep configures the operating system so that Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup runs the first time the end user restarts the computer. This shortened form of GUI-mode Setup takes five or six minutes instead of the usual 45 to 60 minutes, and it prompts the end user only for required end user-specific information, such as accepting the End-User License Agreement (EULA) and entering the Product Key, user name, and company name. You can run Sysprep with the -nosidgen switch to configure Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup on a single computer. In this case, Sysprep enables auditing that you may have done; it automates Mini-Setup so that users can still enter user-specific information, such as regional options and TAPI information; and it bypasses setting up unique SIDs. Use Sysprep in Factory mode (sysprep  factory) to install additional drivers and applications after the reboot following Sysprep. Normally, running Sysprep as the last step in the preinstallation process prepares the computer for delivery. When restarted, the computer displays Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup. With Sysprep running with the -factory option, the computer restarts in a network-enabled state without starting Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup. In this state, Factory.exe processes its answer file Winbom.ini, and performs the following actions: Copies drivers from a network source to the computer. Starts Plug and Play enumeration. Stages, installs, and uninstalls applications on the computer from source files located on either the computer or a network source. Adds customer data. In this state, you can audit the computer. When you finish, run Sysprep with the -reseal option to prepare the computer for delivery to the customer. For example, to create a master installation that contains a minimal set of drivers, run sysprep -factory, create an image of the installation, and then copy the image to multiple destination computers. If any destination computers require additional drivers, run sysprep -factory on the destination computer and load those drivers at that time. Sysprep.inf You can use the answer file Sysprep.inf to prepopulate user configuration information and automate Mini-Setup. If you use Sysprep.inf, Mini-Setup asks for a subset of the configuration information. Otherwise, you can create a completely automated installation that does not ask the user any questions about configuration. Limiting Reseals in Sysprep Windows Product Activation (WPA) enables an end user to use the operating system for 30 days before activating it. After 30 days have elapsed, the operating system will no longer be usable until the end user contacts Microsoft. You can create a master installation, run Sysprep -reseal on it, create an image of that installation, and then safely store that image for more than 30 days. The 30-day countdown for WPA does not begin until the next time the operating system starts. You can use Sysprep for a maximum of three times to reset the activation timer. After the third time you run Sysprep, you can no longer reset the timer. By using the command Sysprep -activated, you can avoid resetting the grace period for activation. This requires that the system be preactivated in the factory. By setting the parameter OEMAuditBoot = 1 in the [Startup] section of Oobeinfo.ini before resealing, you can specify that the computer restarts in Factory mode. This is equivalent to using the Sysprep  factory command. If you need to modify the configuration on the computer before delivering it to the end user, you can press CTRL + SHIFT + F3 at the Windows Welcome Screen to re-enter Audit mode. Running Sysprep with a Network After auditing the master installation, you must run Sysprep, reseal the computer, and then shut it down. You can either ship the computer to your customer or make an image of its installation. Reseal your newly preinstalled computer by simply clicking Reseal in Audit mode to reset Windows Welcome before creating your image. You can also click Audit to restart back into Audit mode, or click Factory to restart into Factory mode. Either make an image of the master installation, or ship the master computer to your customer. Running Sysprep in Manual Mode You can use the following method to run Sysprep after performing a stand-alone (non-networked) preinstallation or after you have already resealed the computer for shipment. To run Sysprep manually Create a C:\Sysprep folder on the master computer. By using Windows Explorer, go to the CD-ROM drive that contains the Windows OPK CD, and copy the following files to the C:\Sysprep folder: Setupcl.exe Sysprep.exe Factory.exe After you have preinstalled any additional software or drivers, click Start, click Run, and then type c:\sysprep\Sysprep -reseal. The computer will shut down, ready for delivery to the customer. On first boot, the operating system will run Windows Welcome for the end user. Building an Image of the Installation After you have preinstalled your master computer, you can use the third-party imaging tool of your choice to build your custom images. You can then deploy the images to destination computers. Configuring the Destination Computer To configure the destination computer, format the hard disk (if desired), and then deploy the image of the resealed installation from the technician computer onto the destination computer s drive. Formatting the Destination Computer s Hard Drive If desired, use Fdisk, Bigfdisk, or any third-party disk utility to format the hard drive on the destination computer. Starting the Destination Computer If you need to start the destination computer, insert the Windows OPK CD or a Windows PE CD into the CD-ROM drive of the destination computer, and then restart the computer. Windows PE will start. Deploying the Image onto the Destination Computer To deploy an image of the operating system to the destination computer, copy the image, duplicate the hard disk of the master computer, or use another method of your choice. The destination computer will be ready for delivery to your customer. Appendix A:  Non-Networked Preinstallation from CD If you want to automate all your preinstallations, you must use the network-based method. Before reading the steps needed to perform a non-networked (CD-based) preinstallation, please review the disadvantages of using this method. It is strongly recommended that you use the network method of preinstallation described in the main body of this document. Disadvantages of a Non-Networked Preinstallation The stand-alone method of preinstalling Windows XP has several disadvantages: You lose valuable time installing applications and running Sysprep manually. You lose fully automated network connectivity in a 32-bit environment. You lose automated partitioning and formatting of the target hard drive, including native NTFS support and the ability to read NTFS file shares from Windows PE. You lose the ability to copy the entire i386 folder automatically to the target computer. You lose the ability to copy custom OEM logos and the Oeminfo.ini file automatically to the master installation. You lose the ability to preinstall applications using the Winbom.ini file, and you lose the ability to install hot fixes or service patches from one location (unless you write them all to a CD and install from the CD). You lose the ability to process the [Factory] section of Winbom.ini automatically on boot into a Sysprep Audit session. You lose the ability to add your OEM Link and prepopulate up to three Most Frequently Used (MFU) shortcuts on the Start menu. You lose the ability to add customized Internet Explorer branding, including a custom search page, button, and home page, as well as additional customized Favorites and a customer support page. You lose the ability to copy and execute Sysprep.exe automatically. You lose the ability to start Audit mode automatically. None of these options were available with the Windows 2000 preinstallation using the CD-based installation. Windows XP is exactly the same as Windows 2000, in that you need to copy your logos and Sysprep files manually to prepare the system for shipment. You must run Sysprep on the new computer to fulfill OEM licensing requirements. The preinstallation process for Windows XP is similar to the process for Windows 2000; however, it is very different from the process for Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition. The Non-Networked Preinstallation Process Important The standard CD-based, stand-alone installation method described in this appendix has limited hardware and application preinstallation and customization capabilities. To create the answer file for a non-networked preinstallation Run the version of Setup Manager that is located in the Deploy.cab file on the Windows OPK CD. This version offers the option of preinstalling Windows XP from a CD. The answer file created is called Winnt.sif. Edit the Winnt.sif file and add a valid Product Key in the ProductKey line, as shown in the example below. [Data] AutoPartition = 1 MsDosInitiated = "0" UnattendedInstall = "Yes" [Unattended] UnattendMode = FullUnattended OemSkipEula = Yes OemPreinstall = Yes TargetPath = WINDOWS UnattendSwitch = Yes [GuiUnattended] AdminPassword = * EncryptedAdminPassword = No AutoLogon = Yes AutoLogonCount = 1 OEMSkipRegional = 1 TimeZone = 85 OemSkipWelcome = 1 [UserData] ProductKey = XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX (replace with a valid Product Key) FullName = "Preferred Customer" OrgName = "Customer" ComputerName = * [Identification] JoinWorkgroup = WORKGROUP [Networking] InstallDefaultComponents = Yes Important To delete all partitions on the drive and reformat the drive with the NTFS file system, add the following line to the Winnt.sif file:  Repartition = Yes The product key can be used for all of your installations because Sysprep resets the product key prior to shipment. Copy the Unattend.txt file to a floppy disk, and then rename the file Winnt.sif. Insert the Windows XP product CD in the CD-ROM drive and start the computer. When the  Press a key  message appears, press any key and insert the floppy disk containing Winnt.sif. An unattended installation of Windows XP will start. After the system has started to the Windows XP desktop, manually copy your Oemlogo.bmp and Oeminfo.ini files to the Windows\System32 folder. For more information about the Oeminfo.ini and Oemlogo.bmp files, see the OPK User s Guide (opk.chm) located in the Docs folder of the Windows OPK CD. The Oeminfo.ini file looks like this: [Version] Microsoft Windows XP and the Windows .NET Server family WinVer = 5.01 [General] Manufacturer = (your info) Model = (your info) [Support Information] Line1 = "support info goes here" Important You must prepopulate LineX = "support info goes here" in order to preinstall the system legally. This will happen automatically if you use the network preinstallation method.

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

This document provides current information about the tools included 
in the Deploy.cab for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and
the Windows .NET Server 2003 family.

NOTE: The Setup Manager tool (Setupmgr.exe) contained in Deploy.cab 
is intended for use only by corporate administrators. If you are 
a system builder, install the tools and documentation contained on 
the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) CD. An OPK CD is contained in every
multi-pack of Windows distributed by an OEM distributor to original 
computer manufacturers, assemblers, reassemblers, and/or software 
preinstallers of computer hardware under the Microsoft OEM System
Builder License Agreement.

Setup Manager no longer contains context-sensitive help. For more
information about the individual pages in Setup Manager, see the 
topic "Setup Manager Settings" in the Microsoft Windows Corporate
Deployment Tools User's Guide (Deploy.chm).

------------------------------------------------

2. UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE TOOLS
------------------------------------------------

You can use either the Windows XP SP1 corporate deployment tools or
the Windows .NET Server 2003 corporate deployment tools to deploy the
following versions of Windows:

*	Original "gold" release of Windows XP 
*	Windows XP SP1 
*	Windows .NET Server 2003 family 

Do not use the original "gold" release of the Windows XP corporate 
deployment tools to deploy Windows XP SP1 or the Windows .NET Server 
2003 family.

----------------------------

3. AVAILABILITY OF WINDOWS PE
----------------------------

Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE, also known as WinPE)
is licensed to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for use in 
preinstalling Windows onto new computers. The WinPE for Corporations 
toolkit is available for enterprise customers. For more information, 
contact your account manager.

---------------

4. KNOWN ISSUES
---------------

This is a list of known issues for the Windows XP SP 1 deployment 
tools:

*  If you preinstall the Multi-Language User Interface (MUI) Pack 
during Sysprep in Factory mode (Sysprep -factory) and then restart 
the computer into Mini-Setup, the user interface throughout 
Mini-Setup is clipped. However, this does not occur if the default
user interface for MUI is set to English (ENG).

Workaround: Set the default user interface for MUI to English.

*  The recommended location for your master installation is on 
drive C or a network share.

The location of the Windows installation is hard-coded by Windows
Setup. Sysprep does not modify these settings or allow you to safely
move an image from one drive letter to another.

If you want to deploy an image of a Windows installation to a
different drive, you must create the original Windows installation
on a disk that uses that drive letter. When you deploy that image,
you must ensure that Mount Manager uses that same drive letter
for %SYSTEMDRIVE%. For example, if you want to deploy the image
to drive D, ensure that Mount Manager enumerates one logical drive
before the drive where you plan to deploy the image. 

*  When the Sysprep.inf file is used as an answer file by Mini-Setup,
the Sysprep.inf file can be located on a floppy disk that you insert
into the disk drive before starting the computer and running 
Mini-Setup. However, if the manufacturer or model of the destination 
computer is different from the manufacturer or model of the master 
computer, the Sysprep.inf file is not read from the floppy disk 
during Mini-Setup.

Cause: To maintain unique disks and controllers on the system bus,
Plug and Play adds a value to the Plug and Play ID, for example: 

       FDC\Generic_Floppy_Drive\5&22768F6A&0&0

If you use a destination computer with hardware that is different
from the hardware on the master computer, the bus is different,
and a new number is assigned. Plug and Play recognizes this hardware
as a new drive and must install the driver before it can be used.
However, the installation does not occur quickly enough, and the 
drive is not accessible by the time Setup checks the drive for the
Sysprep.inf file. 

Workaround: Complete the following procedure on the master computer
before running Sysprep: 

1. Locate and click the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\CoDeviceInstallers

2. Add the following entries and values to this subkey:

Entry:	{4D36E969-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
Type:	Reg_Multi_Sz
Value:	Syssetup.Dll,CriticalDeviceCoInstaller

Entry:	{4D36E980-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
Type:	Reg_Multi_Sz
Value:	SysSetup.Dll,StorageCoInstaller
	SysSetup.Dll,CriticalDeviceCoInstaller

3. Open Sysprep.inf and add the following text to the 
[SysprepMassStorage] section:

	*PNP0701 = "%WINDIR%\inf\flpydisk.inf"
	*PNP0702 = "%WINDIR%\inf\flpydisk.inf"
	*PNP0703 = "%WINDIR%\inf\flpydisk.inf"
	*PNP0704 = "%WINDIR%\inf\flpydisk.inf"
	GenFloppyDisk = "%WINDIR%\inf\flpydisk.inf"
	*PNP0700 = "%WINDIR%\inf\fdc.inf"

where %WINDIR% is the folder on the destination computer where you
installed Windows.

4. Run Sysprep on the computer.

*  Use Winbom.ini only to modify the Windows installation when
you run Sysprep -factory. Do not manually modify the Windows
installation during Sysprep in Factory mode. If you want to modify
the Windows installation manually, use the command Sysprep -audit
instead.

----------------------------

5. DOCUMENTATION CORRECTIONS 
----------------------------

* The topic "Setup Manager Settings" in the Microsoft Windows
Corporate Deployment Tools User's Guide does not include the
following information:

  	Setup Manager saves settings from the Distribution Share 
  	Location page to the following location: 

  	Unattend.txt
  	DistShare =
	DistFolder =

*  The topic "Using Sysprep" in the Microsoft Windows Corporate
Deployment Tools User's Guide does not include the sentence:

	When you run Sysprep.exe, the Sysprep.inf file is copied
	to %WINDIR%\System32\$winnt$.inf.

*  The topic "Using Sysprep" in the Microsoft Windows Corporate
Deployment Tools User's Guide does not include the paragraph:

	You can specify static IP addesses in the Sysprep.inf file. 
	When the destination computer starts, the network interface 
	card (NIC) information is removed, but Plug and Play 
	reinstalls the NIC. Mini-Setup reads the static IP address
	information in Sysprep.inf and sets the static IP address
	in the destination computer.

*  The topic "Preparing Images for Disk Duplication" in the
Microsoft Windows Corporate Deployment Tools User's Guide states:

	The mass-storage controllers (IDE or SCSI) must be identical 
	between the reference and destination computers.

If you want to create one master image to install Windows on
destination computers that may use different mass-storage controllers,
then you want that image to include all mass-storage devices
identified in Machine.inf, Scsi.inf, Pnpscsi.inf, and Mshdc.inf. 
To do this, include the following in your Sysprep.inf file:

	[Sysprep]
	BuildMassStorageSection = Yes 

	[SysprepMassStorage]

For more information, see the topic "Reducing the Number of Master
Images for Computers with Different Mass-Storage Controllers" in
the Microsoft Windows Corporate Deployment Tools User's Guide.

*  In several places, the Microsoft Windows Corporate Deployment Tools
User's Guide states that Sysprep.inf can be located on a floppy disk. 
However, a Sysprep.inf file located on a floppy disk can only be used 
as an answer file for Mini-Setup. Sysprep itself does not use a 
Sysprep.inf file located on a floppy disk.

Plug and Play does not run until after Mini-Setup locates the 
Sysprep.inf file. If the floppy device does not use an in-box driver 
and the Sysprep.inf file is located on a floppy disk, then Mini-Setup 
will not detect the Sysprep.inf file.

The recommended location for the Sysprep.inf file is the C:\Sysprep
folder on the hard disk of the destination computer.

*  The information in the topic "Using the Registry to Control
Sysprep in Factory Mode" in the Microsoft Windows Corporate
Deployment Tools User's Guide is incorrect. Do not use the registry
to control Sysprep.

*  The topic "Preinstalling Applications" in the Microsoft Windows
Corporate Deployment Tools User's Guide does not include the
following information:

	If you add any applications to the Owner profile (in 
	Windows XP Home Edition) or the Administrator profile 
	(in other versions of Windows), Windows Welcome or Mini-Setup 
	copies these applications to the default user profile so that 
	the applications are available when the end user logs on. 
	If you want to install applications to individual user 
	accounts, you must install these applications after Windows
	Welcome or Mini-Setup is finished, or install them by using
	a user account other than Owner or Administrator.

*  The topic "Preinstalling Applications Using Legacy Techniques"
in the Microsoft Windows Corporate Deployment Tools User's Guide does
not specify that the commands listed in [GUIRunOnce] and Cmdlines.txt
are synchronous. Each command finishes before the next command starts.

*  The topic "Using Signed Drivers" in the Microsoft Windows Corporate
Deployment Tools User's Guide does not discuss how to install
unsigned drivers. To install unsigned drivers during Sysprep, 
include the following lines in the Sysprep.inf file:

	[Unattended]
	UpdateInstalledDrivers = Yes

Only install unsigned drivers while testing your deployment tools and
processes. Do not install unsigned drivers in any computers that you
distribute to end users.

*  Your master installation must be located on the C drive or a
network share.

*  Throughout the corporate deployment tools documentation, the
Windows Preinstallation Environment is called "WinPE". The more 
proper abbreviation is "Windows PE".

Contents Introduction Size of Windows PE Reducing the Windows PE Footprint Introduction Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE, also known as WinPE) is a minimal operating system based on the Windows XP kernel. Windows PE replaces MS-DOS as a means for starting a computer in order to install operating systems and applications. It contains the minimum functionality needed to run Windows Setup, scripts, or custom applications. The non-customized size of Windows PE can range from 120 to 220 megabytes (MB). By removing non-essential files, you can reduce the 32-bit version of Windows PE to an on-disk image size of 81 MB. Size of Windows PE The approximate size of a non-customized version of Windows PE is as follows: Platform On-disk image size In-memory size Intel 32-bit Windows PE About 120 MB About 40 MB Intel 64-bit Windows PE About 220 MB About 42 MB In-memory sizes are computed when networking services are running. The size of a custom version of Windows PE will vary, depending on the set of drivers that you choose to include or exclude. The on-disk size of the default Windows PE configuration includes all in-box drivers, many of which are uncompressed. The approximate size of each directory on the 32-bit version of Windows PE is as follows: Directory Approximate size \fonts \System32 66 MB \System32\Drivers 29 MB While Windows PE is too large to fit on a floppy disk, you can place your customized version of Windows PE on many types of bootable media including CD-ROM, DVD, hard disk, or a Remote Installation Services (RIS) Server. If you use a CD-R or CD-RW, the system that you start must support starting from a CD, as well as the ability to read CD R or CD-RW media. Reducing the Windows PE Footprint The following files can be removed from a Windows PE image. Removing certain files listed may affect your ability to connect to a network, but otherwise will not interfere with the functionality of the image. If you remove all of these files, the 32-bit version of Windows PE can be reduced to an on-disk image size of 81 MB. The following table includes a list of fonts that can be safely removed without reducing Windows PE functionality, as well as a list of drivers and other files that can be safely removed.

Contents Introduction Overview of Native Processor Performance Control Processor Performance Control Processor Performance Control Policy BIOS Implementations for Native Processor Performance Control Support via ACPI Implementing Intel SpeedStep Technology SpeedStep Legacy Applet Interface Implementing Intel SpeedStep using the ACPI 2.0 Objects Implementing for AMD PowerNow! Implementing for the K6/2+ Implementing for the K7 "Designed for Windows XP" Logo Program Requirements References Introduction Historically, processors for mobile PC systems ran at lower voltages than processors for desktop PCs; consequently, processors for mobile PC systems also had to run at slower clock speeds. This was not usually an issue because mobile PCs have relatively slow disk and memory subsystems. Mobile PC processors are usually idle when most business applications are being used. The situation is different if high bandwidth I/O subsystems are implemented or if the user is doing something that has high CPU utilization and low I/O bandwidth requirements. This can be the case with many games, and also with DVD playback. Many games will try to use all available CPU. The DVD playback case is different because most soft DVD players will only use about 500MHz of the processor capability. Understanding these limitations in a market environment where  speed  is an important sales factor, CPU manufacturers have introduced processors that employ performance states. These CPUs provide high voltage/high frequency states for use when processor utilization is high and low voltage/low frequency states to conserve battery life. This technology gives OEMs the ability to design a system that can compete both in the speed and battery life benchmark tests. Windows XP implements built-in support for processor performance states. This paper explains the BIOS implementations needed to use the native support and outlines the policies that Windows XP uses for processor performance control. The paper covers implementation of Intel SpeedStep, AMD PowerNow!, and Transmeta LongRun processor performance control technologies.  Overview of Native Processor Performance Control The built-in support for processor performance control in Windows XP consists of two components: Processor performance control and processor performance control policy. Processor performance control is the function that must be done to perform a performance state change. Processor performance control policy is the set of behavior rules used to determine the appropriate performance state to be used. Processor Performance Control Windows XP implements a processor driver architecture to take full advantage of the individual technologies from different CPU vendors. This architecture allows Windows XP to support currently shipping processors, and supports future advances in processors by providing an easy update path for new functionalities and technologies by shipping a new processor driver. Windows XP supports processor performance control via the Processor Objects defined in the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification, version 2.0, and the legacy SMI interface defined by Intel for SpeedStep. Implementation details for each CPU vendor are provided later in this paper. Processor Performance Control Policy In Windows XP, the processor performance control policy is linked to the Power Scheme setting in the standard control panel power options applet. No additional UI is employed to set the policy.  Windows XP defines four control policies for processor performance control: Constant Always runs at lowest performance state Adaptive Performance state chosen based on CPU demand Degrade Starts at lowest performance state, then uses linear performance reduction (stop clock throttling) as battery discharges Always runs at highest performance state The following table shows the relationship between the Power Scheme selected and the control policy used. Power Scheme AC Power DC Power Home/Office Desk Adaptive Portable/Laptop Adaptive Adaptive Presentation Adaptive Degrade Always On Minimal Power Management Adaptive Adaptive Max Battery Adaptive Degrade BIOS Implementations for Native Processor Performance Control Windows XP supports processor performance control via ACPI and some legacy interfaces. This section explains the ACPI support. For legacy interface implementations, see sections specific to the processor you are implementing. Support via ACPI In addition to supporting ACPI 1.0b, Windows XP utilizes the processor objects defined in section 8.3.3 of the ACPI 2.0 specification. The objects were defined in ACPI 2.0 to allow performance switching by the operating system without additional BIOS support.  Implementing the ACPI 2.0 Processor Objects for Windows XP The Windows XP operating system does not support all of the ACPI 2.0 specification. When adding the objects to your ACPI 1.0b BIOS, place objects in the processor object s object list under the \_PR scope. The object list should include _PCT, _PSS, and _PPC. Other than location, use the objects exactly as defined in the ACPI 2.0 specification. Provide the control value in the PSTATE_CNT field of the Fixed ACPI Description Table (FADT) at byte offset 55 as defined in the ACPI 2.0 specification. Byte offset 55 was reserved in ACPI 1.0b. Add the control value for the operating system to write to SMI_CMD to the ACPI 1.0b FADT at byte offset 55. This is the only modification needed to the FADT. The FADT revision field should not be set equal 3, because it is not an ACPI 2.0 table; it is still an ACPI 1.0b table with a reserved field used. Implementation Tips Coding the _PCT The _PCT is defined in the ACPI 2.0 specification to use the Generic Register Descriptor. The ASL Macro for the Generic Register Descriptor is not implemented in any of the current Microsoft ASL Assemblers, dictating that the ASL code for _PCT generate the data. This is a sample _PCT that returns the data in the Generic Register Descriptor format. Name (_PCT, Package (2)         // Performance Control Object ResourceTemplate () {Register(SystemIO, 8, 0, 0xB2)}      // Control Buffer () { 0x82,               // B0-Generic Register Descriptor (section 6.4.3.7) 0xC,0,              // B1:2-length (from _ASI thru _ADR fields) 1,                  // B3-Address space ID, _ASI, SystemIO 8,                  // B4-Register Bit Width, _RBW 0,                  // B5-Register Bit Offset, _RBO          0,                  // B6-Reserved 0xB2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, // B7:14-register address, _ADR (64bits)         0x79,0},            // B15:16-End Tag (section 6.4.2.8) //   ResourceTemplate () {Register(SystemIO, 8, 0, 0xB3)}      // Status  Buffer () { 0x82,               // B0-Generic Register Descriptor (section 6.4.3.7)       0xC,0,              // B1:2-length (2 bytes)            1,                  // B3-Address space ID, _ASI, SystemIO            8,                  // B4-Register Bit Width, _RBW            0,                  // B5-Register Bit Offset, _RBO            0,                  // B6-Reserved            0xB3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, // B7:14-register address, _ADR (64bits)            0x79,0},            // B15:16-End Tag (section 6.4.2.8) }) // End of _PCT object Reporting _PPC When coding _PPC, note that Windows XP implements an adaptive performance control policy to take advantage of the higher-performance states when CPU utilization is high.  Important If a system can support the higher performance states when on battery, do not report in _PPC that only the lower power states are supported. Windows XP will always use the evaluated value of _PPC to determine the number of available performance states. Implementing Intel SpeedStep Technology Windows XP can support Intel SpeedStep using the legacy applet interface or the ACPI 2.0 processor performance objects. It is recommended that systems based on the 440BX chipset use the legacy applet interface. The ACPI 2.0 objects should be used on ICH-based and 440MX systems. SpeedStep Legacy Applet Interface  For systems that were developed and shipped before the Windows XP release, and for all 440BX-based systems, performance switching will be done through the legacy applet interface. Windows XP uses the INT15H/AX=E980h defined in the  Mobile Pentium III Processor Featuring Intel SpeedStep Technology BIOS Writer s Guide  to obtain the Command Data Value and the Command Port Address.  Important Windows XP uses the same performance state switching mechanisms through the SMI port as the Intel SpeedStep applet to do performance switching. For systems that implement the recommendations set forth in the  Mobile Pentium III Processor Featuring Intel SpeedStep Technology BIOS Writer s Guide,  the Command Data Value should equal 82h (the Applet CMD value). The Command Port Address should equal B2h. Native Windows XP processor performance control will not automatically be enabled on systems that use the legacy applet interface unless the registry modifications explained in the next section are implemented. The registry entries will be required for all systems using the legacy applet interface that carry the  Designed for Windows XP  logo. Under the logo requirements, systems must use only the native Windows XP processor performance control. The Intel SpeedStep Applet cannot be used on systems shipping Windows XP.  Enabling Native Performance Control For systems that use the legacy applet interface, performance control must be enabled through a registry key. The registry key used enable the legacy Intel SpeedStep applet interface is: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\HackFlags==0x1 HackFlags definitions: Bit 0 :  Use SpeedStep Applet interface Bit 1 :  Set by OS if applet parameters migrated during upgrade Bit 2 : System can support all modes when running on battery Bit 3-31 :  Reserved Note: All registry key values listed are DWORD values. Registry entry for a system that can only run the highest performance state on AC would be: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\HackFlags==0x1 Registry entry for a system that can support all performance states on battery would be: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\HackFlags==0x5 After this registry key entry is made, Windows XP will assume processor performance control upon next boot. Overriding Command Values via the Registry For systems shipped with wrong values in the INT15/E980 or without the INT15/E980, the command values can be entered through registry keys. The registry keys used to override INT15/E980 values or report nonexistent values are: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\HackFlags==0x5  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\SmiCmdPort==SMI Cmd Data Port HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\SmiCmdData==SMI Cmd Data Value For systems following the  Mobile Pentium III Processor Featuring Intel SpeedStep Technology BIOS Writer s Guide,  the entries will be: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\HackFlags==0x1  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\SmiCmdPort==0xb2 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P3\Parameters\SmiCmdData==0x82 Implementing Intel SpeedStep using the ACPI 2.0 Objects ICH-based based systems should use the ACPI 2.0 processor performance control objects to describe the performance states and control data. For the performance switching on current ICH-based systems, Windows XP uses a SMI interface similar to the Intel SpeedStep applet SMI interface. However, the ports and data values will now be defined using the processor performance control objects as defined in ACPI 2.0. It is highly recommended to follow the Intel BIOS writer s guide for the chipset in the system when implementing SMI interface. ASL Example for ICH-based Systems   Scope(\_PR) Processor(CPU0, // A unique name given to each processor 0x00, // A unique ID given to each processor 0x1010, // ACPI P_BLK address = ACPIBASE + 10 0x06) // ICH has a P_BLK length of 6 bytes. Name(_PCT, Package() Buffer() 0x82, // Resource Template Start 0x0C, 0x00, 0x01, // IO 0x08, // Width 0x00, // Bit offset 0xB2, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x79, // Resource Template End Buffer() 0x82, // Resource Template Start 0x0C, 0x00, 0x01, // IO 0x08, // Width 0x00, // Bit offset 0xB3, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x79, // Resource Template End // End of PCT object Name (_PSS, Package() Package(){750, 22000, 250, 200, 0x83, 0x00}, // State zero. Package(){600, 10000, 250, 200, 0x84, 0x01} // State one. Method (_PPC, 0) // This routine should reflect capabilities // of the platform. If all states can be utilized // always report (0). If (ACON) Return(0) // All states available. Return(1) // State one only available. // End _PR FADT Entries Provide the control value in the PSTATE_CNT field of the Fixed ACPI Description Table (FADT) at byte offset 55. This nonzero value will be written for Windows XP to assume control of performance states. This value should be 80h to disable the SpeedStep Applet interface as described in the Intel BIOS writers guide. The FADT revision field should not be set to 3. Implementing for AMD PowerNow! Windows XP supports processor performance control on K6/2+ and K7 PowerNow! processors. The K6/2+ support uses the SMI interface and BIOS description table to read capabilities. The K7 is only supported via the ACPI 2.0 objects. Once processor capabilities are determined, Windows XP will perform all P-state control directly with no support needed from the system BIOS. Implementing for the K6/2+ The K6/2+ processor driver in Windows XP uses the SMI interface and the Gemini BIOS Descriptor Table (GBDT) as defined in the  Gemini SMI API Specification version 0.80  available from AMD. The SMI interface is used to query the processors capabilities. If the processor is K7 PowerNow! enabled, the driver will then locate the GBDT and read the performance states supported and control values associated with each state in the system. Implementing for the K7 Windows XP requires the ACPI 2.0 objects for systems with K7 PowerNow! processors. The implementation is straightforward and documented in detail by AMD in the  BIOS Support for Windows XP Processor Driver Application Note Revision 1.04.  The mechanism for control and status of the K7 PowerNow! processors are defined in Model Specific Registers (MSRs). This dictates that when defining the _PCT in the namespace use the Functional Fixed Hardware (FFixedHW) address type. Coding the _PCT This is a sample _PCT for FFixedHW as described in the ACPI 2.0 specification, which returns the data in the Generic Register Descriptor format. Name (_PCT, Package (2)         // Performance Control Object ResourceTemplate () {Register(FFixedHW, 0, 0, 0)}      // Control Buffer () { 0x82,               // B0-Generic Register Descriptor(section6.4.3.7) 0xC,0,              // B1:2-length (from _ASI thru _ADR fields) 0x7F,               // B3-Address space ID, _FFixedHW 8,                  // B4-Register Bit Width, _RBW 0,                  // B5-Register Bit Offset, _RBO          0,                  // B6-Reserved 0x0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,  // B7:14-register address, _ADR (64bits)         0x79,0},            // B15:16-End Tag (section 6.4.2.8) //   ResourceTemplate () {Register(FFixedHW, 0, 0, 0)}      // Status  Buffer () { 0x82,               // B0-Generic Register Descriptor(section6.4.3.7)       0xC,0,              // B1:2-length (2 bytes)            0x7F,               // B3-Address space ID, _FFixedHW            8,                  // B4-Register Bit Width, _RBW            0,                  // B5-Register Bit Offset, _RBO            0,                  // B6-Reserved            0x0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,  // B7:14-register address, _ADR (64bits)            0x79,0},            // B15:16-End Tag (section 6.4.2.8) }) // End of _PCT object Implementing for Transmeta LongRun Windows XP supports processor performance control on Transmeta Crusoe processors with Transmeta LongRun Power Management technology. The Crusoe is supported through the ACPI 2.0 processor objects. After Windows XP determines processor capabilities, it will perform all P-state control directly with no support needed from the system BIOS. For details about implementing the _PSS method for Crusoe processors, contact your Transmeta technical sales representative for the appropriate Transmeta documents and collateral material. Coding the _PCT The following code shows a sample _PCT method for FFixedHW as described in the ACPI 2.0 specification. This method returns the data in the Generic Register Descriptor format.

The platform consists of three parts: the HTML user interface; the back-end server; and the upload mechanism. The Web Publishing Wizard The Windows XP Web Publishing Wizard is an advanced Windows wizard that hosts HTML served from remote locations and provides a communication and upload facility to those remote locations from the client. To accomplish this, it uses HTML and DAV with the Web service. A more detailed description can be found below in the Building Online Printing and Web Publishing Wizard Web Sites section. OEMs may add destination Web sites focused on online storage, ranging from specific data file hosting such as audio, pictures, and video to general Web hosts. You may not include Web sites that are not related to the context of the wizard such as a stock-quote service. Added services must appear below the Web sites that are distributed with Windows XP. Destination Web sites included by Microsoft may not be modified in any way. Users have two access points for the Web Publishing Wizard: 1) Webview task:  Publish to the Web 2) The Scanner and Camera Wizard The Web Publishing Wizard supports facilities that allow it to be hosted in other wizards and dialog boxes, such as the Scanner and Camera Wizard and the AutoPlay dialog box. This is the second access point, where users may upload to the Web using the Web Publishing Wizard after downloading images from their imaging device or by inserting removable media.  Once the wizard starts, the user is provided with a list of service partners from which to choose, as shown in the following example: The Web service serves the next set of Web pages remotely. The following is an example from the Community creation process. The Web Publishing Wizard is dependent on Web services. If there is not an active Internet connection, the wizard prompts the end user to start a dial-up connection.  The Online Print Ordering Wizard The Online Print Ordering Wizard is built on the foundation of the Web Publishing Wizard and operates in the same way. It differs, however, in access points and services offered.  OEMs may add additional Internet printing companies to the wizard. Internet printing companies should focus on providing photo printing services to end users. You may not include Web sites that are not related to the context of the wizard such as a stock-quote service. Added services must appear below the Internet printing companies that are distributed with Windows XP. Internet printing companies included by Microsoft may not be modified in any way. Users have two access points to the Online Print Ordering Wizard:  Webview task:  Order Prints from the Internet In the My Pictures folder, the Picture Tasks list appears as follows: 2) The Scanner and Camera Wizard In the Scanner and Camera Wizard, the Online Print Ordering Wizard is hosted as an option, in the same manner as the Web Publishing Wizard.  When launched, the Online Print Ordering Wizard presents the user with a listing of several online service vendors to select from, such as those in the following example. During the second stage of the wizard, users are served HTML from the Web site and are allowed to select and order prints from digital images stored on their local PC. The Web services available through the Online Print Ordering Wizard are for printing digital images, either as regular prints or in special or novelty fashions, such as mugs and shirts.  The following shows an example of what a page in the Online Print Ordering Wizard might look like. Non-related services, such as a car service, are not supported.  As with the Web Publishing Wizard, the Online Print Ordering Wizard requires access to the Internet, and prompts the user for a dial-up connection if no active connection is found.  Service Partners for Web Publishing and Online Photo Ordering Microsoft populates Windows XP with an initial set of offerings. Microsoft OOB (out-of-box) partners are those service providers whose links are included in either the Web Publishing Wizard or the Online Photo Ordering Wizard in the released version of Windows XP. OEMs and end users cannot delete service providers from this list.  After the end user first selects a service provider from the list, the most recently used service provider appears at the top of the list, and will be selected by default the next time the wizard runs.  OEMs and Third-Party Service Partners OEMs may add as many service partners as they want to the Web Publishing Wizard and the Online Print Ordering Wizard. These service partners will be listed in the wizard following the Microsoft OOB partners. The service partner links installed by the OEM will be shown in the order that they are placed in the registry, so that OEMs can customize their list order. The user will need to scroll after six services are listed. Requirements for Third-Party Service Partners  Wizards cannot contain advertisements, objectionable, or adult content.  Each wizard is visually consistent within its screens, but does not need to be consistent with standard Windows wizards. Technical requirements are defined in the Building Online Printing and Web Publishing Wizard Web Sites section.  End Users and Third-Party Service Providers Third-party service providers can create a package that end users can download in order to add a service to the Online Print Ordering or Web Publishing wizards. Service providers can do this by adding an installation program to their Web site or installing with another program (for example, by using a CD or a disk). Icons added this way appear in the list below the OOB partners and the OEM partners. The most-recently-used service partner is always highlighted in the list to simplify the experience for end users. The next time the end user starts the wizard, the most-recently-used service provide appears at the top of the list. The requirements for third-party service providers are described in detail in the Building Online Printing and Web Publishing Wizard Web Sites section. s an example of how third parties can be listed: The ABC company decides that it wants to provide a publishing service through the Web Publishing Wizard. The ABC website presents an icon with a label such as,  Click here to enable Windows XP Web Publishing!  Clicking the icon activates a message related to running code on a local machine from the Web site. The user clicks OK, and the small piece of code simply adds an icon to the local machine and an entry to the registry. No reboots are required. The Web Publishing Wizard now has an entry available for publishing to ABC. This code to add the ABC, or any service, could also be installed with an application. Alternatively, if third parties are not listed, the  Other  item listed in the service space allows the user to enter the URL of a Web site. The Web Publishing Wizard attempts to publish the files to that location. Requirements for Third-Party Service Providers Technical requirements are defined in the Building Online Printing and Web Publishing Wizard Web Sites section. Listing Services Microsoft lists a set of OOB partners that are listed in every version of the operating system. These links must remain at the top of the list.  An OEM can place a partner in the list by adding a registry entry. The wizards automatically place this entry after Microsoft OOB partners. End users can also add any other providers to the wizard. These providers are listed as registry entries and are placed after the OOB partners and OEM partners. The service list shows up in the wizard for the user to pick from as follows: OOB partners OEM partners Third-party Web service providers The following is an example with MSN, two OOB Partners, one OEM partner, and one  Other  available. The most recently used service partner is always highlighted in the list to simplify the experience for end users. This means that the next time the end user starts the wizard, the most recently used service partner appears at the top of the list.  When the user accesses the Web Publishing or Online Print Ordering wizards, it attempts to connect to the Internet and prompts the user for a dial-up connection if no connection is present. At this time, Microsoft does not license other ISVs to host the Web Publishing Wizard and Online Print Ordering Wizard. Building Online Print Ordering and Web Publishing Wizard Web Sites This section of the document contains the necessary information for building a Web site for Web publishing and print ordering related to the Online Print Ordering and Web Publishing wizards in Windows XP.  It also details how to create registry settings to enable additional services to appear in the wizards. Overview With the Web Publishing Wizard in Windows XP, users can create Web sites and upload files to those sites. The Online Print Ordering Wizard in Windows XP allows users to order prints online and upload digital pictures. The server-side user interface (UI) does the creation and communicates information back to the client as necessary.  Also associated with this document is an XML description of the properties of the transfer manifest, which is discussed in  The Transfer Manifest  section of this paper. With these pieces, you can build your own site for creating and publishing to Web sites and ordering prints online. To download the XML files and for more information about the wizards, see  An Overview of Windows XP RC1 Web Publishing and Order Prints Wizards,  provided at the following Web site: http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/imaging/webwizard.htm Adding a link to the wizards Adding a link to your service in the wizards is simple. For each wizard, add a subkey and data to the registry. There are four required fields, each of which is a REG_SZ data type: Meaning IconPath The path to your icon. DisplayName The name displayed for your service. Description The description (second line in the providers list) for your service. The URL for the first page of your service.  SupportedTypes The filetypes supported by your service ( *.jpg  etc). This allows you to only have your service show up for filetypes which you support. To have more than one, use semicolons in a list (ie,  *.jpg; *.bmp You create both links in the registry under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key. The subkey for the Web Publishing Wizard is: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ PublishingWizard\PublishingWizard\Providers\YourServiceName]. The four fields above are then placed under this key.  For your Online Print Ordering sites, use the following subkey: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ PublishingWizard\InternetPhotoPrinting\YourServiceName] When the URL is used, the wizards apply two extras on the end in order to help the service fulfill proper language and location information. For example, if your URL was http://www.mywebservice.com/webwizard/page1.htm, the actual formed URL would be http://www.mywebservice.com/webwizard/page1.htm?lcid=1033&langid=1033. The meaning of the two variables is: Meaning LCID tells the server what country and language the user is working in. LCID is not used to determine the language of the UI, but is used to determine formats for currency, date/time, numbers, and so on. LangId LangId tells the server what the user's default UI language is, so that the server can display the UI in the correct language. Client Design You can write script on your Web pages to communicate with the Web Publishing or Online Print Ordering wizards. The wizards provide the following methods on the window.external object. The calling examples are in JavaScript. void FinalBack(); void FinalNext(); void Cancel(); read-only property Caption; void SetWizardButtons(bool EnableBackButton, bool EnableNextButton, bool LastServerSidePage); void SetHeaderText(string HeaderTitle, string HeaderSubtitle); bool PassportAuthenticate(string bstrSignInUrl); write property Property(string PropertyName, var PropertyValue); read property Property(string PropertyName); Client-side JavaScript on server-side HTML wizard pages call these methods to notify the client of various events during the Web share creation process. FinalBack()  Called when the server wants to tell the client to navigate to the client-side page before the server-side UI appears. For example, the wizard currently shows the first page in the server-side UI. The user clicks Back. The client sends an OnBack() event to the server (see the server-side design later in this paper). Because this is the first server-side page, the server then invokes FinalBack() to tell the client to navigate to the client-side wizard page before the server-side UI appears. FinalNext() Called when the client should navigate to the client-side page beyond the last server-side page. The client may also finish the wizard if there are no client-side pages after the last server-side page. This process is analogous to that of FinalBack(), described earlier. Cancel() Called to simulate clicking a Cancel button. This causes the wizard to exit. Caption() Property Called to set or retrieve the caption. Clients can choose to ignore put_Caption. SetWizardButtons  Called to update the Back, Next, and Finish buttons in the client s wizard frame when a new server-side page is displayed or when required because the user manipulated some UI element on the page. Meaning Bool EnableBack Enable the Back button Bool EnableNext Enable the Next button Bool LastServerSidePage Tell the wizard that this is your last page. When the user clicks a wizard button (Back, Next, or Cancel), the client calls the JavaScript functions OnBack(), OnNext(), and OnCancel(), which must be implemented on each server-side UI page. Clicking Finish causes a call to OnNext(). SetHeaderText  Sets the Title and Subtitle that should appear in the wizard header. PassportAuthenticate Tells the client to show the UI or do whatever else might be necessary to ensure that the user is authenticated to Passport. Meaning String SignInUrl A URL to a Web page that results in a redirection to Passport for log on. This causes the Passport sign-on UI to appear.  Bool Return Value The function returns true if it succeeds, or false otherwise. It is safe to call this function even if a user is already signed in to Passport. In this case, the function returns success without showing any UI. The Property property Allows arbitrary properties to be stored on the client. These properties are accessible from each wizard page and can be used to pass information between pages. These properties are also used to pass information back to the client-side wizard as necessary. A set of properties with well-known names and meanings is defined for this purpose. If the Web page tries to retrieve a property that is not defined, null is returned. Meaning String PropertyName Name of the property to set or retrieve. Script to access these properties looks like this: To put Window.external.Property( PropertyName )=Value; To get Var Value = Window.external.Property( PropertyName Well-Known File-Type Properties The Windows XP client passes these properties to let the server know what types of files will be uploaded. The server then allows or restricts certain types of folders based on the file types. A mix of file types should be assumed if these properties are absent or if UniqueExtensionCount=0.  Meaning UniqueExtensionCount The number of unique file extensions in the set of files that will be uploaded to the server after the server-side UI is completed successfully.   is reserved to indicate mixed or unknown extensions. UniqueExtensionn An array of file-type entries. Each entry is a string beginning with a period, such as  .longextension Server-Side UI Content In general, the client displays the header above the non-HTML region. Call window.external.SetHeaderText() to set the text in the header when your page loads. We expect the server-side UI to offer the following types of pages: Create a new Web site or a new folder on an existing Web site? It shows a list of Web sites that users have write access to. They can select one of these existing sites and say  Create a new site. Create a new community (or club, or site, etc.)? This set of pages includes the EULA, sign-up pages, verification, and so on.  Create a new folder on this community (club, site, etc.)? Servers that do not have all of the capabilities in this list can select not to show certain types of pages. Navigation script functions As described earlier, each page must implement OnBack(), OnNext(), and OnCancel() in a client-side script on each page. These functions should perform navigation between creation pages as appropriate. A client-side script on the pages calls the client s window.external functions as necessary. These functions must be accessible through IHTMLDocument::get_Script on the client side and take no parameters. Clients ignore return values. Function OnBack() This indicates that the user has clicked Back in the wizard.  If the current server-side page is the first server-side page, call window.external.FinalBack() to tell the client to navigate to the previous client-side page. Otherwise, set window.location, or the page navigates to the previous server-side page. Function OnNext() This indicates that the user has clicked Next in the wizard. If the current server-side page is the last server-side page, call window.external.FinalNext() to tell the client to navigate to the next client-side page or to complete the wizard, as appropriate. Otherwise, set window.location should be set, or the page navigates to the next server-side page. Function OnCancel() This indicates that in the wizard, the user has clicked Cancel. The client closes the wizard after OnCancel() is processed. You must design the server-side UI so that the user can cancel at any time. Calling window.external.*() functions The functions that the client implements are accessible from JavaScript on the page through window.external. You can call these functions as necessary. See "Client Design" and "Well-Known File-Type Properties" earlier in this document for a description of the services available through window.external. HTML sample for controlling the wizard The server-side code for a wizard page is very simple. Here s a short sample from the source for the Web service error page: <html>     <head>     <script language="JavaScript">     function window.onload()     {         window.external.SetWizardButtons(1, 0, 0);     }     function window.onback()     {         window.external.FinalBack();     }     </script>     </head>     <body bgcolor=threedface>         <font id=l1 face="Tahoma" size=2>             <P id=l2>Windows was unable to connect to the Internet, or the web service returned an invalid wizard page. </P>             <P id=l3>To return to the previous page and try again, click Back.</P>             <P id=l4>To close this wizard, click Cancel.</P>         </font>     </body> </html> The OnNext() function is implemented similarly to OnBack(): it can navigate the browser to the next server-side page as required. Or it can call window.external.FinalNext to navigate to the next Win32-based page at the end of the HTML pages. Script on the page can access the properties at any time through window.external.Property( Propertyname The Transfer Manifest The Web Publishing Wizard and the Online Print Ordering Wizard use the transfer manifest as a communication channel between the sites generating HTML and the Win32 wizard framework. The manifest describes the files that are going to be transferred, identifying such details as the destination hierarchy and the metadata. In return, the HTML from the site can modify the manifest, removing files from the list and then adding information about where and how the files should be transferred. The manifest is exposed as the property (window.external.Property( TransferManifest ). The manifest is an XML DOM (IXMLDOMDocument). You can view its fields in the sample Manifest.xml file at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/imaging/webwizard.htm. Using the transfer manifest The wizard builds the manifest to contain the basic elements as children of the root node <transfermanifest/>: Meaning <filelist/> Root element for the file list being copied. Has an attribute that indicates whether folders will be used. <file/> Element describing a file to be transferred. Provides the attributes source, destination, and size, as well as the children describing the metadata for the file. <folderlist/> Describes all the folders that are needed to represent the folder tree that is being copied.  <uploadinfo/> Describes information for the upload, including navigation targets, and so on (see  Transferring files  later in this paper). The HTML for the Web site can then use the DOM object to select these nodes and modify their UI accordingly. For example, a photo printing site might use the source information to display thumbnails of all the images that are going to have prints ordered, or a storage site might use the size attribute on a <file/> element to compute the amount to be transferred against the free space available. The manifest is recreated each time the site is navigated to. For example, if the user selects MSN, a copy of the manifest is created for the MSN site to see. If the user then returns to the provider list and selects another site, a new instance of the manifest appears. This allows the site to store state information in the manifest. Transferring files When the HTML UI is ready to call window.external.FinalNext(), it brings the transfer it needs to add information to the manifest about where and how the files will be transferred. The site should always add an <uploadinfo/> element as a child of the root node. This element has an attribute that defines the friendly name of the site to be used. For new Web sites, use the information stored in the manifest instead of the window.external properties that have been defined for legacy sites. The <uploadinfo/> element can have the following children. Meaning <target/> Defines in its body text the URL to which the Web DAV transfer will be made. From this root location, all files are copied, preserving their hierarchy as defined by the destination attribute on the file element. <netplace/> Defines the network place to be created when the upload begins. This folder shortcut in My Network Places gives users file system access to their storage. <htmlui/> Defines the URL that the wizard should open when the wizard is closed. If this is not defined, the <netplace/> location will be used. <favorite/> Defines the favorite to be placed in the user s favorites menu of their browser. It includes a friendly name, a comment, and the actual URL to be used. <successpage/> Defines the URL where the wizard should navigate to on a successful upload of the user s files. <cancelledpage/> Defines the URL where the wizard should navigate to if the user clicks Cancel at any point in the wizard. <failurepage/> Defines the URL where the wizard should navigate to if the upload fails. If no <target/> element is defined, it is assumed that the site is going to use the post protocol to transfer files. The wizard supports multi-part form posting. This includes sending not only the file but optional attributes or metadata. To support the posting, the site must add to each <file/> element to be transferred a child called <post/>. Use the  friendlyname  attribute to define the friendly name in the wizard for the URL to which the wizard navigates at the end. This prevents having to show a long and unnecessary URL for users to remember. The child <post/> defines the identifier, file name, and HREF to use. Each <post/> element may also have <formdata/> children encoded as separate parts within <post/>. Web Publishing and Online Print Ordering Wizards    PAGE  Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can customize certain aspects of Windows Welcome. These enhancements include incorporating the OEM company name and logo into Windows Welcome and making custom ISP sign-up offer(s) available to their users. This document describes how to create an Internet service provider (ISP) sign-up offer that can be incorporated into an OEM s customized version of Windows Welcome. ISP sign-up offers may also be included in applicable locations in the Windows Start menu such as the Most Frequently Used (MFU) list of programs, the OEM link, the Online Services folder, or All Programs. Important OEMs may redistribute this document to third-party ISP partners who are building custom HTML pages to integrate into the OEM s customized version of Windows Welcome. OEMs may also redistribute sample files located in the \Samples\Oobe folder on the Windows XP OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) CD. . While OEMs may share this document with third-party ISP partners, the OPK User s Guide itself (Opk.chm) is confidential between the OEMs and Microsoft and cannot be redistributed to third parties. Contact your Microsoft account manager if you have any questions regarding what information OEMs may share with third parties. OEMs have the option of specifying which type of ISP sign-up is offered to the end user. They can select from one of the following ISP sign-up options. Preconfigure Internet settings in the factory OEM ISP sign-up offer MSN sign-up offer Skipping ISP sign-up This document addresses the first two items on this list. It supplements, and in some cases is more detailed than, information in the OPK User s Guide. Security Settings in Windows Welcome To provide a clean end-user experience during Windows Welcome, the Internet-related confirmation dialog boxes on security settings are not displayed. Instead, Windows Welcome performs essential Web-related tasks invisibly, with no end-user confirmation required. This includes, and is limited to: Submitting unencrypted FORM data over HTTP Applying default Java security settings Allowing JScript run-time ActiveX controls to be created and used Enabling cross-frame scripting  Navigating from one HTTP address to another, and back again Allowing Microsoft ActiveX  to run All ActiveX controls must be signed and marked safe for scripting, otherwise they will not run. These exceptions apply only to content appearing within Windows Welcome. They do not affect or supercede security settings outside of Windows Welcome. OEM Branding in Windows Welcome OEMs can brand Windows Welcome in two ways:  Incorporate the OEM corporate name into the text in certain areas of Windows Welcome. Add a logo in the upper-right corner of all Windows Welcome pages. A sample first page of Windows Welcome Standard Windows Welcome elements are the Windows logo, the OEM logo, and navigation elements. These elements are always present, even during ISP sign-up.  OEMs can refer to the Windows XP OPK User s Guide for more information on how to incorporate their logo or company name in Windows Welcome. Configuring Internet Settings at the Factory If an OEM provides build-to-order computers, it can offer Internet access to its customers when they order their computer. If an end user selects a specific ISP before or during the purchase process, the OEM can preconfigure that Internet access account. An end user can then use that specific account to access the Internet from the Windows desktop without any further sign-up or configuration. To preconfigure the user's Internet account, collect end-user information when the order is placed, such as their name and billing information. Use that information to determine an e-mail name and POP address, and then activate this unique account. Configure the settings for the new Internet account when the computer is built in the factory. Ultimately, this is the best Internet sign-up experience for your users    they turn on the computer and their Internet account is already active. Important If you collect end-user information through a Web site, the Web page must also contain a link to your company's privacy statement. If you populate your users' passwords for their ISP accounts, you must alert them to change their password the first time that they use the Internet. OEM/ISP Collaboration to Create Custom .Ins Files Internet account information is stored in an Internet settings (.ins) file. The Internet settings file is used during Windows Welcome, or the first time users access Internet Explorer or Outlook Express, to open an Internet account. To place a custom .ins file on a build-to-order computer, the OEM must collaborate with the partner ISP(s) to create a process for generating .ins files and creating ISP accounts. For example, this process might involve a pool of accounts that the ISP allocates to the OEM, complete with unique Internet settings files. Or the OEM might connect to the ISP sign-up server, passing on the end-user information needed to create the Internet settings file, and then receiving a unique file from the ISP sign-up server for each user. Creating the Internet Settings File Ispcnfg.ins The OEM or the partner ISP must create a unique Internet settings (.ins) file that contains the appropriate information for the specific Internet account. Name the file Ispcnfg.ins. The .ins file format is an extension of the Windows Dial-Up Networking (.dun) file format. This format conforms to standard Windows .ini file conventions. Windows .ini files have the following characteristics: An .ini file is divided into sections. Section headers are enclosed in square brackets. For example, [Entry] is the Entry section header. Each entry is a line in the form EntryName=EntryValue. Each section can contain multiple entries. Sections are delimited by one blank line. The order of sections is not important. A particular section can be placed anywhere in the .ini file. Comments in an .ini file begin with a semicolon (;). For more information about the .ins file format, see the Microsoft Windows XP Preinstallation Reference (Ref.chm), available in Deploy.cab, located in the \Support\Tools folder on the Windows XP product CD. Processing Ispcnfg.ins Successfully To configure a computer to use this particular Internet account, include this unique Ispcnfg.ins in the %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Html\Ispsgnup\ directory on the build-to-order computer. During the first-run experience, Windows Welcome looks for the .ins file. If it is found, Windows Welcome configures the computer for Internet access automatically, according the information provided in the Ispcnfg.ins file. The Internet Welcome page, Ispsgnup.htm, appears after Windows Welcome so that users know that the Internet service is fully configured and ready to use. Windows Welcome then skips the ISP sign-up user interface screens because the appropriate completed status items for ISP sign-up have already been set. If Windows Welcome does not locate Ispcnfg.ins, it handles ISP sign-up based on the value of the Signup entry in the [Signup] section of the Oobeinfo.ini file.  Customizing the Internet Welcome Page You may customize the title and text of Ispsgnup.htm based on your customers' needs. Place the file in the %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Html\Ispsgnup\ directory. If you prefer to process the .ins file without displaying a welcome message to users, add the following setting to Oobeinfo.ini: [Options] NoIspPreconfig = 1 Preparing for Internet Account Failures Both the OEM and the ISP should thoroughly test the Ispcnfg.ins file, to ensure it is error free. However, if an Internet account failure occurs during the first-run experience, Windows Welcome sets an .ins failure flag in the registry as follows: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Connection Wizard\INS Processing\ Windows Welcome also records the ISP name and support phone number from the .ins file in the registry. The Internet Connection Wizard completed bit is not set. Windows Welcome then proceeds to the ISP sign-up, and a Windows Welcome error message appears. This error message informs the user that the factory-configured Internet account failed to operate, and asks them to call the ISP support phone number. When the user clicks Next on the error message, the Internet sign-up phase of Windows Welcome ends. If users start Internet Explorer or Outlook Express after Windows Welcome is finished, an error message appears. After users click OK, the completed bit is set. If users start Internet Explorer or Outlook Express after that, the standard Internet Explorer or Outlook Express error message appears, stating that they cannot connect to the Internet. OEM ISP Sign-up Offer ISP sign-up offers can be integrated into Windows Welcome, available from the Windows Start menu, or both. With this option, the OEM places a list of ISP offers on the end user s computer, and this list is displayed during full-screen Windows Welcome. Each OEM ISP sign-up offer can consist of as many HTML pages as desired. The OEM can display one ISP offer per page, multiple ISP offers on a single page, or other appropriate layouts and designs. The layout and design should be consistent with that of Windows Welcome. The first page of the OEM custom offer must meet with requirements outlined in the  First Page of the ISP Offer  section in this document. The OEM ISP offer pages must also call the APIs necessary to connect end users with the sign-up services of the ISP that they select. After ISP sign-up is complete, the user completes Windows Welcome. For end users who skip ISP sign-up during Windows Welcome, OEMs may also make ISP sign-up offers available from the Windows XP Start menu or a balloon reminder. These ISP sign-up offers are also available through the New Connection Wizard (NCW) the first time users access the Internet from applications or Windows components. For example, if a user started Internet Explorer but an ISP account is not configured on the computer, a page would start allowing the user to sign up using these ISP offers, or to start the standard NCW. User Experience During an OEM ISP Offer in Windows Welcome ISP sign-up occurs after the registration and activation phases of Windows Welcome. On the ISP sign-up page (Isp.htm), the user selects an ISP offer. This choice initiates the Windows Welcome Dial function, which connects the user online with that provider s ISP sign-up server. The server displays an HTML page or set of pages that request information and provides options relevant to creating an ISP account. Such information may include the end user s name, address, credit-card information, billing preference, choice of user name and password, POP selection, the Terms and Conditions section, and so on. After the user enters all of the necessary information and then clicks Next, the ISP sign-up server creates an .ins file and uses the ProcessINS function to download it to the computer. The downloaded .ins file configures the end user s computer with an ISP account. The computer terminates the phone connection, disconnects from the ISP sign-up server, and continues to the next portion of the Windows Welcome experience. Because the OEM s ISP offer connects to the ISP sign-up server, the OEM and ISP must collaborate in building the ISP offer. User Experience During an OEM ISP Sign-up Offer on the Start Menu At some point after Windows Welcome is finished, users who skip Internet account sign-up during Windows Welcome may start Internet Explorer or Outlook Express from the Start menu. If you configured Windows Welcome to include MSN Internet Access or OEM ISP sign-up offers, then users can choose to view these OEM ISP offers or to use the New Connection Wizard to configure Internet access using a local area network, VPN, or other existing connection. If users select to view the OEM ISP sign-up offers, then the desktop ISP sign-up starts and displays Isp.htm, the same file used for the OEM ISP sign-up offer(s) in Windows Welcome. ISP sign-up offers may also be included in applicable locations in the Start menu, such as the Most Frequently Used (MFU) list of programs, the OEM link, the Online Services folder, or All Programs. A shortcut to one or more ISP sign-up offer may also be located on the Windows desktop if the OEM delays desktop cleanup until seven days after the first-run experience. The Online Services folder is only available in the Windows user interface through the New Connection Wizard. It can also be reached by navigating to the  %systemdrive%\Program Files\Online Services\ folder. By default, this folder contains shortcuts to the Microsoft Internet Referral Service and to MSN Internet Access. You may place shortcuts to any additional Internet sign-up programs in this location. Developing an OEM ISP Sign-up Offer An OEM ISP sign-up offer can consist of an unlimited number of HTML pages, designed and formatted to your needs and specifications while consistent with the existing Windows Welcome pages. The OEM ISP sign-up offer must contain the APIs necessary to connect users to the sign-up server for the ISP that they select. The ISP sign-up offer: Navigates backward and forward in Windows Welcome. Navigates within the pages of the ISP offer itself (if it consists of multiple pages). Meets the requirements specified in this document. Prompts the end user for information related to ISP sign-up, while reusing information collected during Windows registration, if available. Calls the ISP sign-up server of the ISP that the end user selects. Declares that ISP sign-up has been successful and proceeds to the next page of Windows Welcome. To Create an OEM ISP Sign-up Offer Develop an initial ISP sign-up offer page that consists of as many ISPs as the OEM wants. Develop an ISP sign-up offer that meets the requirements stated in this document. Coordinate each ISP s respective sign-up server with other partner ISPs. Specify the name and location of the ISP sign-up server. In the OEM Preinstallation Kit Setup Manager, select the Display a pre-cached (local) list of ISP offers option. Alternatively, you can leave the setting as MSN and modify the existing Isp.htm page. Technology Requirements An ISP sign-up offer can only use HTML, DHTML, ActiveX, or other Internet technologies; it cannot run executable files. All function calls are in Microsoft JScript. The Windows Welcome process exposes many objects and interface services through the external interfaces of the Windows Welcome process. Each HTML page can access these services through HTML script as desired. In some instances, OEMs may wish to enable ISP offers that may be updated online. The first page of the OEM ISP sign-up offer must be stored locally on the hard disk of the user s computer. If the end user chooses to sign up for Internet access from an OEM custom offer, Windows Welcome should disconnect from any existing connection to the Microsoft Global Network and then dial out to an OEM-hosted phone call. First Page of the ISP Offer The first file in the ISP sign-up offer must be named Isp.htm. You may want to name any succeeding files similarly, as part of a series (for example, Isp2.htm, Isp3.htm, and so on). Place these files in the %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Html\Ispsgnup directory. The first page of the ISP offer (Isp.htm) must do the following: Provide sign-up options for a new Internet account through one of the following mechanisms: The default MSN Internet Access sign-up offer. Your custom OEM ISP sign-up offer(s). Both MSN and OEM ISP sign-up offer(s). Re-establish an existing Internet account. Connect to the Internet at a later time. Important All options must be presented in the same manner, with identical selection controls and fonts. Style Sheets Windows Welcome and its files are distributed with a default style sheet, Oobestyl.css. You may use this style sheet in your own pages to speed up development time and provide a consistent design. You can do this by adding the following line to the header of your HTML pages: <link rel=stylesheet type="text/css" href="oobestyl.css"> The HREF attribute that points to Oobestyl.css must be relative to the location of the HTML page. Animated Screen Characters in Windows Welcome Windows Welcome includes a Microsoft Agent character to assist novice users through the one-time process of configuring the new computer. The Qmark agent character is present in all of the pages in the default Windows Welcome experience. To ensure the uniformity of Windows Welcome, Microsoft encourages computer manufacturers to add this Microsoft Agent character to any custom pages they add toin Windows Welcome. For the latest developer information about Microsoft Agent, see the Microsoft Agent Web site at the MSDN Online Web Workshop at:  http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/ There are many advantages to using the Qmark character. The visual design integrates with Help and Support Center, and it is not offensive to international customers. The Qmark character is exclusively for use in Windows Welcome; it is not available for use in other Windows programs that use a Microsoft Agent character, and you may not use other Windows-installed Microsoft agent characters in Windows Welcome. If you want to add your own Agent character, see  Requirements and Guidelines for Creating a Custom Agent Character  in this document. The animated screen character appears only in full-screen Windows Welcome. Adding the Qmark Character to New Windows Welcome Pages The best way to understand how to enable the Qmark character in your customized pages is to look at how it is enabled in existing pages. You enable the character in the Windows Welcome .htm file for your page, and add the Agent content for that page in Agtscrpt.js. For example, Microsoft Agent is enabled in the body style tag with the onload and onunload attributes in Reg1.htm, one of the default registration pages: <body style="background-Color: transparent; background-repeat: no-repeat;"       tabindex=-1       onload="window.parent.Reg1_LoadMe();       window.parent.Agent_Activate('Reg1');"       onunload="window.parent.Agent_Deactivate();"> In addition, you must add the corresponding content for the page in Agtscrpt.js. For example, you can find the entries for Reg1.htm in Agtscrpt.js, starting at: function Agent_Reg1AddCommands() Customizing the Support Phone Number Used in Microsoft Agent The Qmark agent character includes a default menu item for every authored Windows Welcome page called "Tell me where to get assistance." You can customize the character s response to this entry by adding or setting the value of SupportPhoneNumber in the [Options] section of Oobeinfo.ini. For example: [Options] SupportPhoneNumber=1234567 This causes the character to display the number.  Requirements and Guidelines for Creating a Custom Agent Character OEMs may use a different Agent character with prior approval from Microsoft. Submit requests to oobebeta@microsoft.com. Approval is based on the following criteria. The character must: Use the animations that already exist in Windows Welcome. Closely match the look and feel of the Windows XP visual style. Add to the user experience, not detract from it. OEMs may not delete existing Agent scripts, unless the scripts are obviously irrelevant. Follow the existing menu model. Identify itself as a custom character. Any trade names, trademarks, logos, or brands used in connection with the Agent character must be limited to those under which the PC model is manufactured and marketed. For example, "I'm <character_name> from <OEM_name>."  Navigation and Checkpoint-Coding in Windows Welcome Windows Welcome consists of a number of discrete stages, such as the end-user license agreement (EULA), the hardware check, and ISP sign-up. Each of these sections can consist of multiple pages. When you add or remove pages in Windows Welcome, it affects how the user navigates back and forth through the sections and pages. If you do not modify the navigation and check-point coding, the Back and Next buttons may not work correctly, or may not work at all. An OEM s custom ISP sign-up section must integrate seamlessly with the other pages in Windows Welcome. Navigation Architecture of Windows Welcome The first time a user runs Windows on a new computer, Windows Welcome displays a series of HTML pages located on the hard disk. Each on-disk URL (or set of URLs) is associated with a numerical identifier called a checkpoint. The following lists the checkpoints and the files associated with each checkpoint.

It consists of the checkpoint stack and current checkpoint. The checkpoint stack identifies the on-disk URL that Windows Welcome uses when the user clicks Back. When a user completes a given checkpoint, Windows Welcome adds an item to the checkpoint stack. When the user clicks Back, the GoBack JScript function removes the checkpoint for that page off the stack, and navigates to its associated page. For example, for the flow of Animation->Hardware Check->Welcome->EULA page, when the user reaches the page for the End User License Agreement (EULA), the stack looks like this (zero being the bottom of the stack): The mouse tutorial is off by default. The stack numbers start at zero and increase. These stack numbers become the names of the registry keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE\CKPT (checkpoint). In addition, Windows Welcome writes the stack number for the top of the stack to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE\CKPT\TopOfStack registry key. In the above example, TopOfStack is 3. To find out which checkpoint indexes are associated with which URLs, use the InitCKPT function in the Msobshel.htm file. Notes If the computer restarts for whatever reason during Windows Welcome, the user returns to the last major page, which is always on the top of the stack. The Window.history method is inadequate to keep track of navigation because, at various points within Windows Welcome, the user does not return to the previously viewed page when clicking the Back button. Instead, the user returns to the first page of that particular sequence of pages. In addition, some pages drop out of the navigation flow after the user has completed the information requested by that page. The Current Checkpoint The current checkpoint (the JScript variable g_CurrentCKPT) is set whenever Windows Welcome navigates to a new page. This assignment happens when a checkpoint is placed on or removed from the stack. Not all checkpoints get placed on the stack, either because not all pages are important enough to view after a restart, or it is not appropriate to place a page into the normal Back/Next navigation flow of Windows Welcome. For instance, error pages are not placed on the stack. In these cases, g_CurrentCKPT is still set during navigation, eliminating the previous checkpoint, which may or may not have been the top of the checkpoint stack. Code for Navigating Within a Checkpoint Navigating within a checkpoint can also be viewed as navigating within a section of the Windows Welcome experience, such as navigating from one page to another within the IME tutorial or a custom hardware tutorial. For such navigation, you can use standard HTML hyperlink navigation tags. Avoid using navigation that uses the Window.history function. Code for Navigating from One Checkpoint to Another Navigating from one checkpoint to another can also be viewed as navigating to another section of the Windows Welcome experience, such as going from the Welcome page to the EULA page. The functions are as follows: InitFrameRef Initializes the state within the navigation code in Msobshel.htm that is necessary before calling the following navigation functions. If this function is not included, the other navigation functions do not operate. GoNext, GoBack, GoCancel, and GoNavigate These three related functions work in conjunction with GoNavigate, and in general contain the functionality for jumping to a different page. For example, calling GoNext from the TAPI page saves the TAPI settings and then calls GoNavigate to get to the Connect page. GoNavigate contains the checks that are required before navigating to a different page. For instance, when Windows Welcome uses GoNavigate to navigate to the End User License Agreement (EULA) page, Windows Welcome checks if the EULA has already been accepted; if the user has already accepted the EULA, then Windows Welcome automatically goes to the Product Key page.  StatusNavigate Takes the current status item index, calculates the difference between it and the new checkpoint s desired status item index, and calls MoveNext or MovePrevious accordingly. Windows Welcome uses Jscript to handle switching from one checkpoint (and its associated URL) to another. Intra-checkpoint (within a checkpoint) navigation is handled by standard HTML hyperlinks. Avoid controlling navigation using Window.history, because navigation is controlled by the checkpoints. Be careful not to mix these two models; if you do, Windows Welcome will break. Code for Checkpoint Stack Manipulation The code used to manipulate the checkpoint stack is: InitCKPT Loads the checkpoint table, which associates each checkpoint index with its URL. It also initializes the current checkpoint g_CurrentCKPT from the top of the stack, if the stack exists in the registry. PushCKPT Places a checkpoint onto the stack, changes the registry, and sets the value for the current checkpoint, g_CurrentCKPT. PopCKPT Removes a checkpoint from the stack, changes the registry, and sets the value for the current checkpoint, g_CurrentCKPT. Specific Navigation Requirements Generally, you control navigation within your ISP offer. However, you must follow a few rules to ensure a positive end-user experience. The onload handler for the page must call the following function: window.external.ExecScriptFn("InitFrameRef();"); This sets up a state within the JScript navigation code that allows the offer to make other external navigation calls. Include a Back button and a Next button on each page of your ISP sign-up offer. Use standard hyperlinks for navigation from page to page except on the Back and Next buttons on the first page, the Back button on the second page, and the Next button on the last page. If you want to have a Cancel button and go offline, use the GoCancel function. For example: window.external.ExecScriptFn("GoCancel();"); Navigation on the First Page of the OEM ISP Sign-up Offer If the first page (Isp.htm) contains a Back button or equivalent, code the onclick handler of the button as follows: window.external.ExecScriptFn("GoBack();"); This function allows Windows Welcome to navigate the end user away from the OEM ISP sign-up offer and back to the correct previous screen. Without this call, the end user is unable to return to any previous screen. The following is an example of how this might look on the first page of the OEM ISP sign-up offer: <SCRIPT> function MyBackFunction()     //Do something meaningful     //The final call must be      window.external.ExecScriptFn("GoBack();"); </SCRIPT> <BUTTON onclick="MyBackFunction();">Back Button</BUTTON> Navigation on the Last Page of the OEM ISP Sign-up Offer Include a Next button or equivalent on the last page of the offer. The onclick handler of the button must call the following functions: window.external.State.set_ISPSignupCompleted = true; window.external.ExecScriptFn("GoNext();"); In the case of Next, if this call is not made, the user is unable to complete ISP sign-up and is not able to complete the Windows configuration process. Calling GoNext from this page allows the user to complete the process and eventually proceed to the Windows desktop. For example: <SCRIPT> function MyNextFunction()     //Do something meaningful     //The final call must be      window.external.ExecScriptFn("GoNext();"); </SCRIPT> <BUTTON onclick="MyNextFunction();">Next Button</BUTTON> Successful Completion of the ISP Sign-up Offer The following API handles declaration of success: window.external.State.set_ISPSignupCompleted This API, when called from script, lets Windows Welcome know that the OEM ISP sign-up offer successfully completed. Do not set this function to True until the user has completed your entire ISP sign-up offer. Call set_ISPSignupCompleted before GoNext. Calling GoNext allows the user to complete the ISP sign-up process and eventually proceed to the Windows desktop. If the GoNext call is not made, the user is unable to complete Windows Welcome. Navigation to the User-Selected ISP Within your ISP sign-up offer, the OEM and the ISP can access any of Windows Welcome s native Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs are exposed through the Document Object Model (DOM) of the browser in the following form: window.external.SomeAPI where SomeAPI refers to a particular API accessible in script from Window.External. In addition to many other APIs, Windows Welcome provides several APIs that are specifically designed to support the needs for providing ISP offers and sign-up capability to end users. The minimal API needed to call for successful ISP signup is: window.external.Dial([Path to ISP file]); When called from a script, this API takes a path to a standard .isp file. If the file path is not absolute, the API searches for the relative path based on the current directory. The following is an example of how to call this API: <SCRIPT> window.external.Dial("myispfile.isp"); </SCRIPT> For a comprehensive API reference, see the Microsoft Windows XP Preinstallation Reference (Ref.chm), available in Deploy.cab, located in the \Support\Tools folder on the Windows XP product CD. Creating Reminders for ISP Sign-up  For users who do not configure an ISP account during Windows Welcome, you can specify up to three ISP sign-up reminders. By default, no ISP reminders are configured. To activate ISP sign-up reminders for users who do not complete ISP sign-up during Windows Welcome, you must manually add the entries DesktopISPRemind and ISPRemind1 (and optionally, ISPRemind2 and ISPRemind3) to the [DesktopReminders] section of %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Oobeinfo.ini. For example, the following entries in Oobeinfo.ini enable the ISP sign-up reminders and schedule the reminders to occur five, ten, and fifteen days after the user completes Windows Welcome. [DesktopReminders] DesktopISPRemind= 1 ISPremind1=5 ISPRemind2=10 ISPRemind3=15 When Windows Welcome detects these entries in Oobeinfo.ini, it creates tasks in Task Scheduler that display a balloon reminder to the user after the specified number of days. When the ISP sign-up reminder activates, a balloon reminder is displayed to the user. Upon clicking the balloon, Windows Welcome displays the file %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Html\Ispsgnup\Isp.htm. This page must also include a Cancel button and an option that allows users the option of receiving any future reminders. When the user clicks Cancel, close the reminder window. Because Isp.htm is displayed in full screen Windows Welcome and also used for ISP sign-up offers available from the reminder notifications, take care to implement the option to not be reminded again in such a way that it is only visible to the user when viewing the sign-up offers outside of Windows Welcome. Use window.external.DeleteRemind(1) and window.external.Finish to delete reminders and close the reminder window. After desktop ISP sign-up is complete, the user navigates to the file %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\Oobe\Setup\Fini.htm. Format and Dimensions. In contrast to the full-screen Windows Welcome ISP sign-up pages, the desktop ISP sign-up pages are displayed in a maximized browser window, not full-screen. The window is displayed at 800 by 600 pixels, less the height of the window border and title bar. At resolutions less than 800 by 600 pixels, scroll bars are used to enable the user to view the entire ISP sign-up offer.  To ensure the consistency and quality of any custom ISP sign-up pages that you create, test your ISP sign-up pages at different resolutions in both full-screen Windows Welcome and from other access points such as the sign-up reminders and the Windows Start menu. Internet Access Through the New Connection Wizard If you include custom OEM Internet sign-up offers in Windows Welcome, users who skipped sign-up during Windows Welcome can view your offer(s) when they access the Internet the first time. The options available to users are: View the ISP offer(s) provided by your computer maker  See other ways to connect to the Internet  When users choose to view your offer, Isp.htm appears. If users choose to see other ways to connect to the Internet, the New Connection Wizard appears. If you do not create custom OEM Internet sign-up offers, the New Connection Wizard appears automatically when users access the Internet the first time. For more information about the New Connection Wizard, see the Microsoft Windows XP Help and Support Center. To cause the New Connection Wizard to start when Internet Explorer or Outlook Express is started, the [Signup] section of Oobeinfo.ini must have the following entry: ISPSignup=none To cause the OEM ISP sign-up offer (that you created) to be displayed when Internet Explorer or Outlook Express is started, the [Signup] section of Oobeinfo.ini must have the following entry: ISPSignup=offline Windows then displays the OEM ISP sign-up offer page (Isp.htm) to the user in a browser window. OEM/ISP Collaboration for Configuring ISP Sign-up Servers Establishing an Internet account for the end user is a coordinated effort between the ISP and the OEM. For the sake of the end user, it s important that connecting from the OEM ISP sign-up offer on the computer to the end user s ISP of choice goes smoothly. This exchange involves the following elements: Connecting from the OEM s ISP sign-up offer on the computer to the .isp file of the ISP of choice. Connecting from the .isp file to the ISP s sign-up server. Proper functioning and navigation of the ISP sign-up server for moving the end user through the offer, and generating and downloading the .ins file to the end user s computer. Proper execution of the downloaded .ins file to create an ISP account on the end user s computer. When the end user selects your service as the ISP of choice on the OEM ISP sign-up offer, Windows Welcome connects to your service, and it calls an .isp file that you have created. The .isp file then connects Windows Welcome to your ISP sign-up server, appending important information in the URL, which the ISP sign-up server can then process. The ISP sign-up server leads the end user through the process of setting up an account, and then generates the .ins file. The .ins file is then downloaded to the end user s computer. The ISP sign-up server then disconnects, and Windows Welcome runs the .ins file, setting up the new account on the computer. The .isp and .ins file formats are extensions of the Windows Dial-Up Networking (.dun) file format. These formats conform to standard Windows .ini file conventions. For a list of Windows .ini files characteristics, see the section  Creating the Internet Settings File Ispcnfg.ins,  in this document. The .isp file contains the information a computer requires to dial up and connect to your ISP sign-up server. You are responsible for providing your own .isp file and ISP sign-up server. Coordinate with the OEM to ensure that your .isp files are correctly configured to work with the OEM ISP sign-up offer. For more information about the .isp file format, see Appendix A,  ISP/INS File Reference  in this document. Connecting from the .Isp File to the ISP s Sign-up Server The .isp file must provide sufficient information to dial into and log onto your ISP sign-up server. After a successful connection is established, the browser window of Windows Welcome automatically navigates to the URL specified in the [URL] section of the .isp file as follows: [URL] Signup=https://www.fabrikam.com/default.asp?/  The question mark at the end of the URL is required. The browser window appends a query string in name/value pairs to the specified URL. This query string contains additional information that you may find helpful in signing up the end user. The complete URL might look as follows: http://signup.fabrikam.com/signup.asp?LCID=1&TCID=1&OfferCode=     0&OS=1&BUILD=2156&OEMName=FABRIKAM&BroadbandDeviceName=     devicename&BroadbandDevicePnpid=pnpidfromregistry/ LCID is the User Language and Country ID from the Regional Settings in the registry. TCID is the TAPI Country ID in the registry. OfferCode, which comes from the [Signup] section of the Oobeinfo.ini file, may be used as an additional piece of information for OEM customization. If relevant, the OEM must identify the offer code(s) for the ISP. OS is the Windows operating system, identified in the registry: 1 = Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition. 2 = Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP. BUILD is the build number of the operating system, and it comes from the registry. OEMName is from the [Branding] section of the Oobeinfo.ini file. The ISP sign-up server must parse this data out of the URL request and use the information to appropriately determine what pages to show the end user. Proper Functioning and Navigation of the ISP Sign-up Server The ISP sign-up server that you create must have the following characteristics: Format and Dimensions. An ISP sign-up server is to be displayed using HTML, DHTML, ActiveX, or other Internet technologies. It cannot run executable files. It must fit within the Display pane of the Windows Welcome full-screen window. General Navigation. Navigation is fully controlled by you, but you must follow a few rules to ensure a positive end-user Windows Welcome experience. Include a Back button and a Next button on each page of the ISP offer except the last page, and include Back and Finish buttons on the last page. Use standard hyperlinks for navigation from page to page. The Back button on the first page and the Finish button on the final ISP sign-up page are handled differently. They are described next in this document. Navigation on the First Page of the ISP Sign-up Server. The first page of the ISP sign-up server must have a Back button in addition to a Next button. The Back button calls the Windows Welcome function window.history.Back. This returns the ISP offer page from the cache. Navigation on the Last Page of the ISP Sign-up Server. The last page of ISP sign-up server must create an .ins file and then calls the window.external.processINS(url) function to download and process the .ins file. After the .ins file is downloaded, Windows Welcome automatically disconnects from the ISP sign-up server. If you do not want the end user to be automatically disconnected after the .ins file is downloaded and processed, you can add the entry Keep_Connection = Yes in the [Custom] section of the .ins file. To close the connection, use window.external.Disconnect. Finally, to end ISP sign-up, the Finish button on the last page of the ISP sign-up server calls the Windows Welcome function window.parent.GoNext. This ends the ISP sign-up phase and takes the end user to the final Windows Welcome settings. For information regarding error handling when connecting to the ISP or processing the .ins file, see Appendix Error Conditions Related to Windows Welcome  in this document. Lastly, when the OEM has finished all aspects of coordinating the ISP sign-up offer with the ISPs, the OEM selects the OEM ISP Sign-up offer when building the Oobeinfo.ini file using Setup Manager. Doing this adds the following value to the [Signup] section of the Oobeinfo.ini file: [Signup] ISPSignup=Offline Appendix A:  ISP/INS File Reference The .isp and .ins file formats are extensions of the Windows Dial-Up Networking (.dun) file format. These formats all conform to standard Windows .ini file conventions. Windows .ini files have the following characteristics: An .ini file is divided into sections. Section headers are enclosed in square brackets. For example, [Entry] is the Entry section header. Each entry is a line of the form EntryName=EntryValue. Each section can contain multiple entries. Sections are delimited by one blank line. The order of sections is not important. A particular section can be placed anywhere in the .ini file. Comments in an .ini file begin with a semicolon (;). For a complete reference to the .ini file format, see the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit (SDK). ISP File Information The .isp file contains information a computer requires to dial up and connect to your ISP sign-up server. A single .isp file can be used by all clients who want to sign up. You can generate the .isp file by using another application if you prefer. In that case, you can use information in the following table to help you customize entries to point to your ISP sign-up server. [Section] or entry Comment Format Required? [Entry] Entry description. Entry_Name = Name of the entry for your sign-up server connection listed in Windows XP Dial-Up Networking. Text string [Phone] Phone number description. Dial_As_Is = Must be No for this release.

The .ins file contains the parameters needed to set up Internet access and service for the subscriber. The .ins file must be generated dynamically by your ISP sign-up server, using the data collected from the new subscriber during sign-up. The dynamically generated .ins file is then downloaded to the client computer after a successful sign-up operation. The .ins file is made unique for each user who signs up by including the Name and Password in the .ins file. If you do not want to include the subscriber s real name and password in the .ins file, you must use placeholder values. The ISP sign-up server at your site must generate an .ins file for each new subscriber according to the format specifications described in the following table, and customized to point to the correct access POP server for your subscriber s location. The .ins file contains the parameters needed to set up Internet access and service for the subscriber. If the .ins file is generated for a build-to-order computer, and is being generated dynamically by your ISP sign-up server, it can use the data collected from the new subscriber during the sign-up operation. After a successful sign-up operation, the dynamically generated .ins file downloads to the client computer. The .ins file is made unique for each user who signs up by including the Name and Password in the .ins file. If you do not want to include the subscriber s real name and password in the .ins file, you must use placeholder values. The ISP sign-up server at your site must generate an .ins file for each new subscriber according to the format specifications described in the following table and customized to point to the correct access POP server for your subscriber s location.

You can take advantage of enhanced dialing services using Connection Manager, which is included in Windows If you want to use Connection Manager instead of Dial-Up Networking, use one of the two following solutions. Customize the .ins file to support a Connection Manager service profile. Place all Connection Manager settings in the Internet Explorer .ins file. Customizing the .Ins File to Support a Connection Manager Service Profile The easiest way to use enhanced dialing services involves creating a distributable Connection Manager service profile, and then incorporating support for that profile into the .ins file. This profile can be downloaded to the end user s computer just prior to the .ins file processing, by using the getFile function. After the service profile is saved to the appropriate location, you can use the ProcessINS function to download an .ins file. The following procedure describes the creation of the Connection Manager service profile, and the modifications that must be made to the .ins file to support the service profile. To Customize the .ins file to support a Connection Manager service profile Use the Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) that is distributed with Windows 2000 Server to recreate a distributable Connection Manager profile. In the Connection Manager Customization dialog box in the Customizing Setup section of the Internet Explorer 6 Customization Wizard, include the service profile for the installation package. In the [Entry] section of the .ins file, specify a service name that is identical to the ServiceName entry specified in the [Connection Manager] section of the Connection Manager .cms file that was generated when you created the service profile. In the [Custom Dialer] section of the .ins file, type the following two entries, which enables Connection Manager to be used as the default dialer for Internet Explorer (although users must still set the default on their computers): Auto_Dial_DLL=cmdial32.dll Auto_Dial_Function=_InetDialHandler@16 In the [Custom] section of the .ins file, type the following entries: Run=icwconn2.exe Keep_Connection=yes In the [ClientSetup] section of the .ins file, specify the following two entries: Done_Message=End of Signup Message Explore_Command=URL/Window to Launch for Initial CM Connection If you do not specify both entries, the end user might receive error messages. In the .ins file, to set the user data, create Connection Manager [Entry], [User], [Phone], and [Backup Phone] sections, and specify the following entries for each section: [Entry] Entry_Name=ServiceProfileServiceName [User] Name=UserName Password=UserPassword   ;(in plain text) Tunnel_Domain=LogonDomain   ;(for logon dialog box, if appropriate) Tunnel_Name=UserName   ;(for VPN, if appropriate) Tunnel_Password=UserPassword   ;(in plain text, for VPN, if appropriate) UserNamePrefix=RealmNameToBePrefixedToUserName UserNameSuffix=RealmNameToBeSuffixedToUserName [Phone] Phone_Number=PrimaryAccessNumber Dial_As_Is=YesOrNo Country_ID=TAPICodeForCountry/Region   ;(use only if Dial_As_Is=Yes) Area_Code=AreaCodeAppendedToNumber   ;(use only if Dial_As_Is=Yes) [Backup Phone] Phone_Number=BackupAccessNumber Dial_As_Is=YesOrNo Country_ID=TapiCodeForCountry/Region   ;(use only if Dial_As_Is=Yes) Area_Code=AreaCodeAppendedToNumber   ;(use only if Dial_As_Is=Yes) For more information about editing the .cms file for Connection Manager, see the CMAK Help. For more information about editing the .ins file for Internet Explorer, see the IEAK Help. Placing All Connection Manager Settings in the Internet Explorer .Ins File If you do not want to download a Connection Manager profile during ISP sign-up, Windows Welcome does support incorporation of all Connection Manager service-profile information in the .ins file, which it then uses to create the service profile and install it on the end user s computer. After the initial Connection Manager service profile is installed, the end user can use it to connect and obtain another service profile (a full-service profile that includes all required attached files). To provide this support, create the initial Connection Manager service profile by using the CMAK, and then copy the information from the service-profile files directly into the appropriate sections in the .ins file by using the following procedure. The CMAK is available in Windows Server, Windows Administration Pack, and from other sources. When Windows Welcome downloads the .ins file, it recognizes information in these sections that belong to the .cmp, .cms, pbk, .pbr, and .inf files normally used in a Connection Manager service profile, and uses them to create the appropriate service-profile files. Do not take these steps if the end user already has the service profile. To update an existing service profile, see Step 1 of the procedure  To customize the .ins file to support a Connection Manager service profile  in this document. To download an initial Connection Manager service profile using the .ins file Use the latest version of the CMAK to create a Connection Manager service-profile file (.cmp) and, if appropriate, use advanced customization techniques to further customize it. Test the service profile on all supported platforms. In the Internet Explorer .ins file, create a [Connection Manager CMP] section, and then copy the information from the .cmp file (created in Step 1) into this section. Change all section titles from the .cmp file so that, instead of being enclosed with square brackets, they are enclosed with braces (curly brackets). For example, change [Profile Format] to {Profile Format}. The braces indicate that they are subsections, not sections, of the .ins file. For example: [Connection Manager CMP] {Profile Format} {Connection Manager} The [Connection Manager CMP] section contains user-configurable data such as the user name, domain, password, phone numbers, and so on. Specify the appropriate entries in this section in order to populate a profile with this data. In the .ins file, create a [Connection Manager CMS 0] section, specify the name of the .cms file instead of the placeholder (ServiceProfileFileName), and then copy the information from the .cms file into this section. Remember to change the brackets in the .cms file to braces, as in the previous step. For example:  [Connection Manager CMS 0] CMSFile=ServiceProfileFileName Contents from this .cms file If you have merged service profiles, you must create a section for the .cms file of each merged service profile. Specify the section name [Connection Manager CMS 1] for the first merged service profile, the name [Connection Manager CMS 2] for the second merged profile, and so on. In the .ins file, create a [Connection Manager PBK 0] section, specify the name of the .pbk file instead of the placeholder (PhoneBookFileName), and then copy the information from the .pbk file into this section. Remember to change the brackets in the .pbk file to braces, as covered earlier. For example: [Connection Manager PBK 0] PbkName=PhoneBookFileName Contents from this .pbk file If you have merged service profiles that contain phone books, you must create a section for each additional phone book (.pbk) file. Specify a section name of [Connection Manager PBK 1] for the first merged phone book, [Connection Manager PBK 2] for the second one, and so on. In the .ins file, create a [Connection Manager PBR 0] section, specify the name of the .pbr file instead of the placeholder (PhoneBookRegionFileName), and then copy the information from the .pbr file into this section. Remember to change the brackets in the .pbr file to braces, as covered previously. For example:  [Connection Manager PBR 0] PbrName=PhoneBookRegionFileName Contents from this .pbr file If you have merged service profiles that contain phone books, you must create a section for each additional phone book region (.pbr) file. Specify the section name [Connection Manager PBR 1] for the first merged phone book, the name [Connection Manager PBR 2] for the second one, and so on. Remember that each .pbk file must have a corresponding .pbr file of the same name. In the .ins file, create a [Connection Manager INF] section, and then copy the information from the .inf file into this section. Remember to change the brackets in the .inf file to braces, as covered previously. For example:  [Connection Manager INF] Contents from the .inf file Before posting the .ins file to the ISP sign-up server, test it on all supported operating systems. Appendix C Windows Welcome Errors This appendix covers ISP connection errors and .ins file processing errors. ISP Connection Errors When the browser window of Windows Welcome detects a server error or becomes disconnected, it automatically displays an error screen asking the end user if they want to redial. If the end user chooses to redial, the the .isp file redials and the user is connected to a backup URL specified in the same section of the .isp file: Reconnect=https://signup.isp_name.net/reconnect.asp? where: signup.isp_name.net/reconnect.asp indicates the URL of the ISPs reconnect page. Notes The question mark is required. In order to navigate back to the page in the ISP sign-up offer immediately prior to the page that goes online, the Back button (or equivalent) must call the following function:  window.history.goBack(); When sending the end user to the reconnect URL, Windows Welcome appends data in name/value pairs to the end of the URL as it did on the first connection, but it appends one additional value that is not sent on the first connection: http://signup.fabrikam.com/reconnect.asp?LCID=1&TCID=1 (&ISPSignup=MSN&OfferCode=0&OS=1&BUILD=XXXX (&OEMName=FABRIKAM&Error=0 where Error is the type of error that occurred. A value of 0 indicates a disconnect error occurred, and a value of 1 indicates that a server error occurred. Design the reconnect URL on the ISP sign-up server such that it displays an error message appropriate to the type of error that occurred. It should also  sniff  the registry to determine what items have been completed, and redirect the end user to the appropriate sign-up server page when they click Next. You can track the number of times a server error has occurred by using the following function: HRESULT set_RegValue( hKey,BSTR bstruSubKey,BSTR bstrName,  VARIANT vValue The second time a server error occurs, Windows Welcome redirects the end user to the error message  The Internet service provider you selected is currently experiencing difficulties. The Reconnect URL can determine that this is the same user (by using cookies, for example), and navigate the user automatically to where he or she was when, or before, the error occurred. window.external.ProcessINS( local .Ins File Processing Errors If the .ins file processing succeeds, this function returns  true.  If it fails for any reason, it returns  false.  The correct error handling can be provided by the ISP sign-up server by using script, based on this return value. For example: <SCRIPT> //try to process the INS file if (window.external.ProcessINS("MyINSFile.INS") != true)    //an error has occurred, take the appropriate action   //continue normally </SCRIPT> ISP File Processing Failures in an ISP Sign-up Offer If the OEM provides build-to-order computers to its customers, the OEM can offer Internet service to its customers when they order their computer. The OEM can collect end-user information, determine an e-mail name and POP, and turn on the account at order time. Then when the computer is built in the factory, the OEM can preconfigure it for this new Internet account. Ultimately, this is the best Internet sign-up experience that end users can have they turn on the computer and the Internet works. For more information about preconfiguring an Internet account on a build-to-order computer, see  Configuring Internet Settings at the Factory,  earlier in this document. If there is an error processing the .ins file, the end user is prompted with an error page. This error page informs the end user that the Internet connection was not properly configured, and it asks the end user to call his or her Internet service provider. The page is then populated with the ISP name and support phone number from entries contained in the Ispcnfg.ins file. This information is also saved to the desktop as an HTML file for later reference. Since the OEM tests .ins files at the factory, Ispcnfg.ins errors should not occur on a computer that has a factory set ISP sign-up offer. However, if an error occurs while Windows Welcome is processing the Ispcnfg.ins file, it sets an .ins failure flag in the registry: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Connection Wizard\INS Processing Windows Welcome also records, in the registry, the ISP name and support phone number from the .ins file. The New Connection Wizard completed bit is not set. Windows Welcome then proceeds to the user interface for ISP sign-up, and displays a Windows Welcome error page. This error page informs the end user that Internet preconfiguration failed and asks them to call the ISP support phone number, which is derived from the just-set registry entry. When the end user clicks Next on the error page, the error page calls the ISPSignupComplete interface that ends the ISP sign-up phase of Windows Welcome. If the user tries to start Internet Explorer or Outlook Express after Windows Welcome finishes, an existing New Connection Wizard error message is triggered that resembles the error message encountered during Windows Welcome. After the end user clicks OK in that error message, the New Connection Wizard completed bit is set. If the user tries to start Internet Explorer or Outlook Express after that, they simply see a standard Internet Explorer or Outlook Express error message related to not being able to connect.

Introduction OEMs can customize the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) by modifying some of the .inf files included. The modifications can be done programmatically, enabling the reuse of a single WinPE image. The possible customizations include the following: The background bitmap and loader string can be changed, and the startup logo can be disabled. Debug mode can be specified. Registry keys can be added to the Software, Default, and Setupreg.hiv hives. Support for other languages can be added. Files can be added to the WinPE image. The startup configuration can be modified to replace Cmd.exe with another shell. The startup configuration can be modified to replace Startnet.cmd with another file to start network services. These customizations involve modifying the Config.inf, Extra.inf, and Winpesys.inf files in the \WinPE folder. All customizations use the standard .inf syntax as specified in the Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK). IMPORTANT Do not modify any other .inf files in the WinPE folder than the three listed in this document. Other .inf modifications can prevent WinPE from booting or running properly. Changing Winpe.bmp This bitmap is displayed behind the desktop. Any .bmp file can be used, but the file name must be Winpe.bmp.  Config.inf Config.inf is processed by Buildhives.exe, which is called by the Makeimg.cmd. Buildhives.exe uses Config.inf to create the Software, Default, and Setupreg.hiv hives. Adding Registry Hives and Entries Use the [Add Registry New] section to add registry entries. The Software hive is created by the first entry, shown here: [Add Registry New] software = .\hivesft.inf,AddReg,.\hivecls.inf,AddReg Two .inf files are listed, each with an AddReg directive. The result is that the Software hive is created using the keys specified in the two .inf files.  To add keys to a hive, use the [Add Registry Existing] section and follow the same procedure, as shown here: [Add Registry Existing] software = .\winpesft.inf,AddReg Adding Support for Other Languages Use the [RegionalSettings] section to add support for multiple languages to WinPE.  In this sample, Japanese language support is added to an English image. [RegionalSettings] LanguageGroup=1 Language=0x0411 Language Value: locale_ID Specifies the language/locale to be installed. This language must be supported by one of the language groups specified by using the LanguageGroup entry. If an available language group does not support the locale, Setup uses the default language for this version of Windows. For a list of valid locales and their language groups, visit the Microsoft Global Software Development Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/. LanguageGroup Value: language_group_ID[, language_group_ID[, ...]] Specifies the language group for this installation. You cannot specify a particular locale or language unless the appropriate language group is installed. In Windows XP, if support for one language group is installed, then support for all corresponding language groups is also installed. For example, if you install one language group from the set of East Asian Languages language groups, then support for the associated language groups is also installed. If you install one language group from the set of complex script language groups, then all complex script language groups are installed. For a list of specific languages that correspond to particular language groups, see the Microsoft Global Software Development Web site at: http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/ The supported language group IDs are listed in the following table. Language Group Corresponding Value in Regional and Language Options Control Panel Western Europe and United States Installed by Default Central Europe Installed by Default Baltic Installed by Default Greek Installed by Default Cyrillic Installed by Default Turkic Installed by Default Japanese East Asian Language Korean East Asian Language Traditional Chinese East Asian Language Simplified Chinese East Asian Language Complex Script Hebrew Complex Script Arabic Complex Script Vietnamese Complex Script Indic Complex Script Georgian Installed by Default Armenian Installed by Default Debugging WinPE To debug WinPE, add the /debug and /baudrate switches to the osloadoptions entry in the [InfChanges] section.  [InfChanges] osloadoptions=txtsetup.sif,setupdata,"/fastdetect /debug /baudrate=115200 /minint" Changing the Loader Prompt To customize the loader prompt, edit the default string in quotes in this entry to the [InfChanges] section. [InfChanges] loaderprompt=txtsetup.sif,setupdata,"Starting Windows XP Preinstallation Environment..." Disabling the Startup Logo The startup logo cannot be changed, but it can be disabled. Add the /noguiboot switch to the osloadoptions entry, as follows: [InfChanges] osloadoptions=txtsetup.sif,setupdata,"/fastdetect /noguiboot /minint" Extra.inf To add files to the WinPE image, modify the Extra.inf file. If the files added require registry entries, edit Config.inf to add the keys corresponding to the added files. List your files to be added in the appropriate section. The files are copied from your source image to the WinPE destination image. The [ExtraFiles] section lists the default files added to WinPE. The .x86 and .ia64 sections following are for adding files specific to those architectures. The default Extra.inf: ; WinPE extra file list [Version] signature="$Windows NT$" ClassGUID={00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} [ExtraFiles] txtsetup.sif=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 setupreg.hiv=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 sam=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 security=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 software=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 default=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 sam.log=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 security.log=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 software.log=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,3 vga850.fon=1,,,,,,2_,22,0,0,,1,22 vgaoem.fon=1,,,,,,2_,22,0,0,,1,22 winbom.ini=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 netcfg.exe=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 factory.exe=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 startnet.cmd=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 wpetcpip.inf=1,,,,,,,,0,0,nettcpip.inf,1,20 wpenb.inf=1,,,,,,,,0,0,netnb.inf,1,20 wpemscli.inf=1,,,,,,,,0,0,netmscli.inf,1,20 winpeoem.sif=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 winpe.bmp=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 [ExtraFiles.x86] ntoskrnl.exe=1,,,,,,,,0,0,ntkrnlmp.exe,1,2 setupldr.bin=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 bootfix.bin=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 biosinfo.inf=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 halacpi.dll=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 halapic.dll=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 halaacpi.dll=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 [ExtraFiles.ia64] ntkrnlmp.exe=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 setupldr.efi=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 efinvr.exe=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,2 Extra.inf Syntax The entry syntax has thirteen parameters, as shown here: [ExtraFiles] txtsetup.sif=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 The syntax of the entries, with parameters listed by position, is as follows: filename_on_source= [disk_ID],  [subdirectory],  [size],  [checksum],  [unused],  [unused],  [boot_media_order:{1|2|3|x|blank}],  [destination_directory],  [upgrade_disposition:{0|1|2|3}],  [text-mode_disposition:{0|1|2|3}],  [destination_filename],  [source_directory_ID],  [destination_directory_ID], The parameters and their values are as follows: description value disk ID disk_id of the disk containing the file subdirectory directory_name of the directory containing the file file_size of the file checksum checksum of the file unused unused boot media order 1: floppy disk #1 2: floppy disk #2 3: floppy disk #3 x: Text-mode Setup : GUI-mode Setup destination directory directory_name: 1-41 chars upgrade disposition 0: always copy 1: copy if present 2: copy if not present 3: never copy Text-mode disposition 0: always copy 1: copy if present 2: copy if not present 3: never copy destination filename new name for the file on the WinPE image source directory ID ID from the WinPE directory table of source directory containing the file destination directory ID ID from the WinPE directory table of directory containing the file  Using the first entry of the [ExtraFiles] section as an example, the file Txtsetup.sif is copied as follows: [ExtraFiles] txtsetup.sif=1,,,,,,,,0,0,,1,1 parameter 1: copied from a disk of diskID=1 parameter 8: always copied when upgrading parameter 9: always copied in Text-mode parameter 11: copied from the source system root directory (see the table below) parameter 12: copied to the destination system root directory (see the table below) This entry demonstrates the renaming of the source file and the use of a different destination directory.

WinPE replaces DOS as a means for booting a computer in order to install operating systems and applications.  With WinPE, you can automate the installation of Windows and applications to your workstations and servers. WinPE supports all mass-storage devices that use Windows 2000 or Windows XP drivers, and additional drivers can be added. As specified in the WinPE licensing terms, you cannot run any Microsoft executables of any kind after loading WinPE.  WinPE Features WinPE is a minimal Win32 subsystem with limited services, based on the Windows XP Professional kernel running in protected mode.  The Windows PE CD is a bootable copy of the 32-bit version of WinPE () that supports all mass-storage and networking drivers contained on the Windows XP Professional CD. WinPE includes the following: A hardware-independent Windows environment for both x86 and IA64 architectures, with a small footprint on both the bootable media and in memory.  A subset of the Win32 API for running custom applications. Network access and support for standard network drivers that may be required for copying images and test suites from a network using TCP/IP. You can add or remove network drivers to customize WinPE.  Support for all mass-storage devices that use Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows .NET Server family drivers. As new devices become available, you can remove unneeded drivers or add additional drivers.  Support to create, delete, format, and manage NTFS partitions.  Hardware diagnostics can be run by loading and testing specific hardware drivers.  Support for the Pre-boot eXecution Environment (PXE) protocol, which can be used to install images from a Remote Installation Server (RIS). If the network card in the computer includes PXE, the card can detect a RIS server and automatically install the WinPE image.  Important To prevent piracy, WinPE reboots automatically after 24 hours of continuous use. Initial Startup WinPE uses the Windows Setup loader instead of the regular boot loader to load Windows. In the initial boot of WinPE, Setup Loader loads the mass-storage device drivers listed in Winpeoem.sif. If no drivers are listed in Winpeoem.sif, Setup Loader loads all of the mass-storage devices present in Windows XP Professional. WinPE will attempt to use the highest screen resolution possible, up to 800x600, 24-bit. While WinPE is starting, press F6 to load a particular device that does not have in-box support and is not listed in Winpeoem.sif. When starting WinPE from a CD, Plug and Play detects the network card installed on the computer, loads the appropriate driver, and binds the network stack. To further reduce the time required to detect the network card, you can customize WinPE to only search for a given set of network drivers, rather than all the network drivers normally present in Windows XP Professional. WinPE loads a standard, single-CPU HAL. Press F5 to load a particular HAL. Win32 Subsystem By default, WinPE uses the Cmd.exe shell. You must customize WinPE to use an alternative shell or application. To do this, edit the  CmdLine  entry in Winpesys.inf to specify your replacement for Cmd.exe. Warning Be careful when editing Winpesys.inf. Even a misplaced comma in it can keep WinPE from booting. When the Win32 subsystem starts, WinPE starts the Cmd.exe shell by using the following entry in Winpesys.inf:  ; startup configuration HKLM,"Setup","CmdLine",,"cmd.exe /k startnet.cmd" Replace "cmd.exe /k startnet.cmd" with the command line for your application. Winbom.ini If Factory.exe does not find a Winbom.ini file, on either the WinPE image or a floppy disk, it stops running. The settings in Winbom.ini provide a wide range of preinstallation tasks. To perform tasks beyond the scope of Winbom.ini, create batch files or scripts to supplement Winbom.ini. With WinPE running, you can use Winbom.ini or your own batch files to do any of the following: Copy a test harness to the destination computer and run hardware diagnostics.  Establish network connectivity with the NET USE command, and change directories to the location of the preinstalled images.  Copy images or install applications from network sources. Order of Operations in WinPE When you start a computer using WinPE, you are running the command factory -winpe, which processes these sections in Winbom.ini in this order:  [WinPE.Net]  [DiskConfig]  [OEMRunOnce]  [OEMRun]  [WinPE], except for the Restart entry  [UpdateSystem]  The Restart entry in [WinPE]  For more information on Winbom.ini, see Ref.chm in Deploy.cab on the Windows XP CD. Limitations of WinPE To prevent piracy, WinPE automatically exits whatever shell it is running and reboots after 24 hours of continuous use.  A computer running WinPE can make a maximum of 4 network connections.  From a WinPE computer, you can directly access servers and shares across the network, using the required network credentials. However, you cannot access any files or folders located on a WinPE computer from another location on your network.  You cannot access any files or folders located on a DFS share.  The tested methods of gaining network connectivity to file servers are TCP/IP and NetBIOS over TCP/IP. Other methods, such as the SPX/IPX network protocol, are untested and unsupported.  WinPE requires a VGA-compatible device and will attempt to use the highest screen resolution possible, up to 800x600, 24-bit. WinPE is too large to fit on a floppy disk.  Due to anti-piracy concerns, you can only build a customized version of WinPE from the Windows XP Professional CD. You cannot build a custom version of WinPE from Windows XP Home Edition or any member of the Windows .NET Server family.  WinPE stores the registry hives in memory so that applications can write to the registry. Any changes made to the registry by the applications do not persist across different WinPE sessions. Windows APIs That Are Not Supported on WinPE To minimize its size, WinPE includes only a subset of the available Win32 APIs, including I/O (disk and network) and core Win32 APIs. If a Win32 API subset is exposed based on a service running on Win32, it may or may not be available on WinPE. The following categories of functions of the Win32 API set are not present in WinPE. For more information on these categories, see the Microsoft Platform SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp). Windows Multimedia  Still Image  OpenGL  NetShow Theater Administration  Bitmap  Brush  Windows Shell  Access Control  Power Options  Printing and Print Spooler  Window Station and Desktop  Terminal Services  User Profile  Tape Backup  Size of WinPE The approximate size of a non-customized version of WinPE is as follows: Platform On-disk image size In-memory size Intel x86 Windows PE Intel IA64 Windows PE ~220 MB ~42MB In-memory sizes are computed when networking services are running. The size of a custom version of WinPE will vary, depending on the set of drivers you choose to include or exclude. The on-disk size of the default WinPE configuration includes all in-box drivers, and many of these drivers are uncompressed. The approximate size of each directory on the 32-bit version of WinPE is as follows: Directory Approximate size \System32 \System32\Drivers \fonts While WinPE is too large to fit on a floppy disk, you can place your customized version of WinPE on many types of bootable media including CD-ROM, DVD, hard disk, or a Remote Installation Services (RIS) Server. If you are using a CD-R or CD-RW, the system you are booting must support booting from CD, as well as the ability to read  CD-R or CD-RW media. Reducing the WinPE Footprint By removing non-essential files, the x86 version of WinPE can be reduced to an on-disk image size of 81 megabytes. See Appendix 1: Reducing WinPE for the list of files. Extensions of the Basic Process: Further Customizations of WinPE You may choose to further customize this version of WinPE in one or more of the following ways before copying it to a CD or hard disk. Include a Specific Winbom.ini or Startnet.cmd  You can include a generic Winbom.ini file in a custom WinPE installation that specifies basic information about connecting to your network, formatting the hard disk, and running basic hardware diagnostics. You can include a generic Winbom.ini file in a custom WinPE installation. Factory.exe uses this file if another Winbom.ini is not located on the floppy disk. After using the settings in [WinPE.Net] to establish network connectivity, the Factory tool can use the NewWinbom entry to point to another Winbom.ini file located on the network. You can use the [OEMRun] section in the Winbom.ini file to customize the script that starts. You can also create your own version of Startnet.cmd to run a specific set of commands, batch files, or scripts. To gain access to Windows networking APIs, run the command netcfg -winpe from the WinPE command line. Add or Remove Mass Storage Drivers By default, all network drivers on the Windows XP Professional CD are included in the WinPE image. When you create your own WinPE image, you can add or remove the network drivers or replace the network driver list. By keeping the list to a minimum, you reduce the time required for PnP detection. Customize the Winpeoem.sif file to control which mass-storage drivers are loaded in WinPE. Creating a Bootable Version of WinPE on CD or DVD You can modify the included version of WinPE to suit your needs by including any system images, applications, or scripts that you wish to include in your final CD or DVD. With your WinPE image ready, use the OSCDImg command to write the image to CD or DVD. Do not redistribute Etfsboot.com or Oscdimg.exe with your WinPE images. OSCDImg Syntax The OSCImg command uses the following syntax: OSCDImg  betfsboot.com  n sourceroot destination.iso. Option Action -llabelname Specifies the volume label. No spaces between the l and the labelname.  For example: -lMYLABEL -tmm/dd/yyyy,hh:mm:ss Specifies the time stamp for all files and directories. Do not use any spaces. Use the American date format and a 24-hour clock. May use any delimiter between the items.  For example: -t12/31/2000,15:01:00 Use the Universal Coordinated Time for all files rather than the local time. Include hidden files and directories. Allow long file names. -blocation Specifies the location of the El Torito boot sector file. Do not use any spaces.  For example: -bc:\directory\Etfsboot.bin sourceroot Required. Specifies the location of the WinPE files that you want to build into an .iso image.  image_file Specifies the name of the .iso image file you want to create that contains the WinPE files. To create a bootable WinPE disk Click Start, click Run, and then type cmd.exe.  Change directories to the location containing Etfsboot.com and OSCDImg.exe (included in the Buildtools.zip in the Extras folder). Type OSCDImg  betfsboot.com  n sourceroot destination.iso. Use any non-Microsoft tool that will copy ISO images to CD to create your CDs. To create an ISO formatted DVD  UDF and UDF/ISO bridge media are not supported in WinPE. Create your ideal WinPE image, which could include an entire Sysprep desktop image of several gigabytes. Complete the same steps above, but include the  m command-line switch. This overrides the block that checks to make sure your ISO image will fit on a CD. You will need to manually check to insure your resulting image will fit on the final DVD recordable media or DVD 5 or 9 (if you are having your media mastered), as OSCDImg will not check for ISO image size above CD standards.  Use any non-Microsoft tool that will copy ISO images to DVD to create your WinPE DVD. Important To configure the WinPE CD so that it boots from the CD every time, if the WinPE CD is present in the CD-ROM drive, remove the \i386\Bootfix.bin file from the WinPE directory structure before you create an .iso file.  Placing a Bootable Version of WinPE on a Hard Disk You can only place a 32-bit version of WinPE on a hard disk. Before you begin, you must format the destination hard disk and install the Recovery Console on this hard disk. To install the Recovery Console Place the Windows XP Professional CD in the CD-ROM drive. You can do this from an existing Windows installation, or by booting new hardware to WinPE on a CD, DVD, or RIS Server. Run cd_drive\i386\winnt32.exe /cmdcons where cd_drive is the drive containing the Windows XP CD.  Now the hard disk is ready for a bootable copy of WinPE. To place WinPE on a hard disk On the destination hard disk, create a C:\Minint directory. You must name the directory Minint.  Use xcopy to copy all of the contents of build_location\i386 to C:\Minint. build_location is the current location of your WinPE build, on a CD, network share, or hard disk. xcopy C:\Build.x86\i386\*.* /S C:\Minint where C:\Build.x86 is build_location. Copy Winbom.ini from build_location to the root of the destination hard disk.  copy C:\Build.x86\Winbom.ini C:\ where C:\Build.X86 is build_location. On the destination hard disk, change the read-only attribute for C:\Cmdcons\txtsetup.sif to read/write.  attrib -r C:\Cmdcons\txtsetup.sif On the destination hard disk, copy C:\Minint\txtsetup.sif to C:\Cmdcons.  xcopy C:\Minint\txtsetup.sif C:\Cmdcons Restart the destination computer. On the Boot menu, select the Command Console. The computer will boot using WinPE.  Appendix 1: Reducing WinPE These files can be removed from a WinPE image without interfering with its function. If all of these are removed, the x86 version of WinPE can be reduced to an on-disk image size of 81 megabytes. driver files inf files other fonts ac300nd5.sys net10.inf avmc20.dll ahronbd.ttf

Help and Support Center is the help application in Windows XP, replacing traditional HTML Help.  This is an HTML-based application that allows users to get help from local help files or remote help repositories. Based upon Help Center from Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me), HSC delivers a user experience that enables users to find information that, in both consumer and business environments, solves their problems and shows them how to use features in Windows. Goals of this document Having read this document, an OEM who is customizing or extending the Help and Support application should have a clear understanding of opportunities and requirements associated with changing the Help and Support user experience.  This document should be exhaustive when covering specific details about Help and Support OEM customization, and all issues should be covered. Help and Support Center in Windows XP Microsoft s newest operating system will be delivered in several different SKUs: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional, and various flavors of Windows .NET Server. Help and Support Center will be delivered on all Windows SKUs.  There will be different customization opportunities for some of the SKUs; these will be called out later in this document. Who Should Use This Document This document is for OEM managers and developers who are delivering Windows and plan to customize and extend the HSC application.  This document outlines the opportunities and requirements that apply to the customization process. HSC Layout Map Reference this layout map when reading about the various customization opportunities within Help and Support Center. User Interface Elements The HSC interface is simple, with a layout that is consistent throughout the application.  There are static regions that persist, and there are regions that change based upon the users  current task and location within the application.  This section describes each region and its significance to the HSC user experience, along with the opportunities for customization by an OEM. Any trade names, trademarks, logos or brands displayed in these customizations shall be limited to those under which your customer system is marketed and distributed in accordance with your OEM license agreement. HSC Global Elements Help and Support Center has a number of elements that are consistent throughout the application and design conventions that are repeated as often as possible.  This makes for an application that is not only easy to learn, but easy to use. We hope that OEMs realize the need to make this application easy for users and will conform to these conventions where possible.  It is important to keep in mind that HSC is the place where users can find information and solutions on their own accord, potentially preventing a number of calls to a support organization. Main Window Area The Main Window Area is the part of the window that begins directly beneath the Header Area and extends to the bottom of the application window.  The Main Window Area is an HTML panel, but it hosts a number of ActiveX controls and Internet Explorer behaviors for extended functionality. Help and Support Center has a graphical interface that is not bound like typical applications, and has built-in opportunities for branding.  Customization in the Main Window Area depends upon the usage of that space, and these specifics are described in later sections.  Look for discussions referring to the home page and subsites.  Navigation Bar The Navigation Bar, or NavBar, is the element at the top of the HSC window that allows for quick linking to places within Help and Support Center.  We considered and tested what the requirements should be for a link to be present on the HSC NavBar.  When considering what to add to the NavBar, keep in mind that the elements should be links that a user may want to access from anywhere within HSC, regardless of the task or context. In other words, these should be  global  links.  We expect users to use the NavBar to jump quickly to a different place, probably abandoning their current task.  Opportunities for OEM customization of the NavBar are almost exactly the same as they were in Windows Me Help Center.  NavBar Opportunities OEM can add elements to the NavBar that will physically fit within the window width. OEM can change text elements to graphical elements. [Favorites] and [History] can be available on the NavBar, as set by each user s preference.  OEM can set the default to be on or off. NavBar Criteria OEM cannot change graphic for Back [<-] and Forward [->] buttons on the NavBar. Back [<-], Forward [->], and Home [Home] must remain as the leftmost elements on the NavBar.  [Options] link must remain as the rightmost element on the NavBar. Core user links for accessing areas within HSC must be preserved. These are:   [Index] and [Support] Elements in the NavBar must be navigational links  No static (inactive) images or brand elements in the NavBar. NavBar Suggestions The NavBar is an awesome customization opportunity, but it should not be overused.  Too many links have indicated that users might not immediately see one of the links. In usability testing, it was common for users to focus on the Main Window Area before exploring the NavBar.  Thus, it may be wise to include important links on the home page, even if already represented in the NavBar.  The NavBar has been changed from an HTML Panel to a Win32 Cool bar that is common with Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer.  Its style will be pulled from system settings.  Appendix B outlines exactly how to extend the functionality and elements of the NavBar. Header Area The Header Area hosts the NavBar element and appears directly above the Main Window Area.  In addition to the Navigation Bar, the application title and the search function are housed in the Header Area. Header Area Opportunities OEM can change the application name to suit. Branding images and watermarks may be added across the Header Area. Header Area Criteria Search must remain in the Header Area, but can appear on either the left or right side. Search must be titled  Search. If the application name is changed, Microsoft reference must be at least 12px high or 10pt font in the following form: Windows XP [Professional] - Microsoft Help and Support Center Header Area Suggestions The only functionality in the Header Area is the Search.  Otherwise, the Header Area should be used to brand and title the Help and Support application.  We encourage the OEM to brand their specific Help and Support application in this area.  Of course, other things should be changed to match if this is done, but all branding should be driven by what appears in the Header Area. HSC Home Page The home page is the content page of the Main Window Area that is loaded when HSC is launched. This includes instantiation from the Start Menu, and all other launch methods, including but not limited to desktop shortcuts, application links, and hardware buttons.  This is also the content page that is loaded when the user clicks [Home] on the NavBar.  This page is significant because this is where a user will most often begin using HSC, and the page will become the user s reference point for all that is offered in the application. Home Page Integration The integrated home page is a result of cooperation between Microsoft and the OEM to define an experience that evenly represents the functionality provided within the application and sets user expectations about what can be found in, and how to use, Help and Support Center.  This includes offerings from both the OEM and Microsoft. The goal of the integrated home page is to present the most significant areas of Help and Support that are most likely to help a user get the information he or she needs. Because Microsoft is making OEM accommodations at all levels of the taxonomy, the OEM must not expose any additional hierarchy of help content or help information on the HSC home page.  This does not specifically preclude the OEM from exposing other information hierarchies elsewhere in the application, but the OEM should strive to organize any and all relevant content at the top levels of and throughout the taxonomy.   Home Page Opportunities OEM has one graphical grouping on desktop SKUs (Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Home Edition). OEM has up to three top-level taxonomy entries on desktop SKUs. 40% of home page area is devoted to OEM content or links. OEM can change taxonomy icons to match overall design. Help Headlines are now optional, but highly recommended. Home Page Criteria Links to the following must be on the home page: Remote Assistance Tools (formerly System Restore) Windows Update Compatible Hardware and Software There must be no product or service advertising on the home page. If Help Headlines are used, no advertising links are to appear in any of the headlines. OEM cannot extend the left side of the home page, other than taxonomy extension.  The Microsoft copyright link must be present on Server, Advanced Server, and DataCenter Server home pages.  It is not required for Home Edition or Professional home pages. Integrated Home Page Suggestions Microsoft suggests that the home page be as simple and as clean as possible.  User choices should be clear and distinct so users can easily choose the link they need.  OEMs are encouraged to expose additional and exciting elements that have been appended by the OEM to the Help and Support Center application. Help Headlines are not required, but they are extremely valuable and it is recommended that they are used to keep users up-to-date.   HSC Subsites Help and Support Center uses sub-pages of functionality called  subsites.  All have the same concept and design.  Users navigate and browse on the left side of the Main Window Area, and view or interact with content on the right side of the Main Window Area.  If and when the OEM adds additional subsites to HSC, the same convention should be followed. This design convention is maintained in the following HSC subsites and features: - XMLTOC subsites - HSC Index - HSC Tools - Support  - Favorites  - History  - Remote Assistance - Compatible Hardware and Software - Windows Update - Other Windows XP Help  - Help and Support Options Desktop-specific Interface Elements The experience on the desktop versions of the HSC application is targeted to novice and intermediate users, with some configurable options addressing the needs of higher-level intermediate and advanced users. The Home Edition and Professional SKUs of Windows XP Help and Support Center will have a more graphical home page than will the .NET Server SKUs.  To the left of the taxonomy elements on the home page are icons that add meaning to the text and hopefully, for sustained use, give users visual anchors with which to associate specific tasks.  This allows users to enjoy more success in finding information when browsing. The OEM will be able to add one top-level grouping, an associated icon, and up to three bulleted links to the right of that icon.  This is part of the taxonomy and is rendered automatically from the structure and content added to the taxonomy.  This taxonomy addition is not a change that is done through UI customization. Server-specific Interface Elements Windows Server users traditionally spend more time working with computers. They possess higher-level skills for navigating content, searching, and managing Windows.  Considering this and the increased volume of the server help content, there are a few features that are unique to the UI of the server versions of HSC.  For example, the server home page provides access to the Error and Event Log Messages subsite. Additionally, the server version of the taxonomy is much larger with no graphical icons, and no separation of areas.  The taxonomy appears as one long list, to which the OEM may add only one top-level node. All other considerations are the same as desktop SKUs of Windows XP. Server Visual Design Relative to the desktop SKUs, the .NET Server SKUs will have a slightly different template or visual design applied to relate the content to the appropriate branding for each server SKU.  However, across the different server SKUs the application will have the same overall feel and user experience.  Differences will be made only where necessary and the interface will be as consistent and congruous as possible. Server Navigation Taglines or descriptions for all of the content links have been removed to optimize real estate.  We use  fly out  or expansion menus on the server SKUs for second-level navigation to better organize or  chunk  the deep server content and make it easier to navigate.   XML Table Of Contents (XMLTOC)  XML Table of Contents The XMLTOC in Windows XP is the taxonomy of help content that a user browses in Help and Support Center. Relative to Windows Me, OEMs now have more opportunity to add content and links to the taxonomy in HSC. Nodes in the taxonomy are groupings that contain topics or other nodes.  Topics are individual pieces of content that are displayed in the right side of the Main Window Area. Microsoft PC Health is making available a Production Tool that simplifies the addition of content into Help and Support Center.  This application hosts a graphical interface that allows OEMs to add their own content at top levels and to insert nodes and topics throughout the rest of the taxonomy.  For more information, email hscprod@microsoft.com. Modifying the XMLTOC The XMLTOC (taxonomy) is designed to be extensible and updateable, to give the customer the most convenient access to the broadest scope of content.  OEMs have the opportunity to add content and links to the taxonomy at build time (pre-install) and post-ship of Windows XP. Because Microsoft is making OEM accommodations at all levels of the taxonomy, the OEM must not expose any additional hierarchy of help content or help information on the HSC home page.  This does not specifically preclude the OEM from exposing other information hierarchies elsewhere in the application, but the OEM should strive to organize any and all relevant content at the top levels of and throughout the taxonomy.   XMLTOC Opportunities OEM gets top-level grouping [and icon] for OEM nodes. OEM can add [up to three] nodes to the top level of the taxonomy: Content should be, for the most part, mutually exclusive Nodes should be added here only if not already represented elsewhere in the Microsoft taxonomy OEM can add any number of [new] nodes at the second level or below.  In server versions, new nodes can be created at any level below the fly-out menus. OEM can add any number of topics in existing or newly created nodes. XMLTOC Criteria Existing nodes cannot be removed. Existing nodes cannot be renamed. OEM cannot expose any other hierarchy of help information on the home page. XMLTOC Suggestions OEMs should incorporate as much useful content into the existing HSC taxonomy as possible.  This is a valuable way for users to find OEM content.  We realize the time commitment involved in distributing content throughout the existing taxonomy.  Therefore, the OEM should concentrate first on organizing its own content in the available top-level links, and then on inserting content throughout the taxonomy. There is also the opportunity to update the taxonomy after the OEM has shipped Windows XP.  This way, if content work is ongoing, the OEM can deliver a content update that has more content distribution throughout the taxonomy. XMLOC Content and Keyword Search As content is inserted using the Production Tool, there is the opportunity to associate keywords with topics.  Any content that is key-worded will be queried upon during keyword search, allowing OEM content to appear in the search result set with the Microsoft content.  This is another avenue by which users can easily access the content added by the OEM. Desktop XMLTOC Considerations As described is section 3.3 the OEM will be able to create a top-level grouping with up to three nodes in the taxonomy. Server XMLTOC Considerations Because the server taxonomy has much more structure and content than the Desktop version, the OEM will only be able to add one node at the top-level of the server taxonomy.  The OEM should strive to keep content in their own areas of the Server taxonomy, as it may not incorporate well with the Server structure.  All other considerations are the same as desktop SKUs of Windows XP. HSC Search Search Overview Search is central to the help experience.  For users in troubleshooting-mode, search is usually the primary tool they use to resolve a specific problem or issue.  Other users might browse or navigate to a certain point in the taxonomy and when they cannot find what they are looking for, try a search to broaden their path.  In any scenario, search is a critical feature which adds usability to a large body of content.   Using and Extending Search User Interface The main search access points are: Search label and button Search input box  [Set search options] link  Search Label and Button The text used for the search label and button was designed to associate the search with the rest of the UI and clearly identify the actionable button for users.  This label must be maintained throughout HSC since it relates context to the user and defines the body of content being searched. Search Input Box The search input box is not customizable and there should not be a need to change this element. In Windows XP HSC the search box is available on the toolbar so that it is accessible from every page.  This location has proven very discoverable to users in usability tests, so the search box with the elements described above should be positioned prominently on the banner of every page.    [Set search options] link This link is for convenience.  It allows users quick access to the page where search options can be set.  The other point of entry is through the [Options] entry on the NavBar.  Access to the Set Search Options page is mandatory since it provides users access to helpful search settings such as: Number of results to display per page Enabling/disabling the search highlighting feature Customized options pertaining to each individual search provider Retaining the link to Set Search Options in the Options is mandatory.  Retaining the link in the banner area is highly recommended, since its close association to the search box aids usability of search overall. Extensible Search Broker Help and Support Center search is extensible and allows you to incorporate other search engines and formats.  The search is managed by a search broker, which interprets and displays results as defined by a search wrapper.  The wrapper is a COM Object that can be authored by organizations who want to customize their HSC search.   Search Wrapper Customization Because different content providers might tag their content differently, HSC search results are separated by provider in the Windows XP HSC UI.  In future implementations we plan to move towards a standard tagging schema that will allow better integration of content from different providers. In this release, however, we use a set of parameters that the search broker interprets from the search wrapper to control display of search results within the HSC UI.  These parameters are: Title Description Content Type The minimal parameters needed by the search broker to display a search result are the title and location of the item.  However, the more parameters or tagging employed by the provider, the more possibilities there are for enhancing the results set (in terms of expanded information about the result, filtering, and advanced search options).    Once a search engine is registered on the machine, it will be allocated a  provider bar  or title bar in the UI that allows the user to expand the bar to see results from that selected search provider.  By default, HSC will have the  Suggested Topics  or keyword results set open on the desktop SKUs.  HSC server versions will default to open the Full-text Search results.  As part of the OEM customization, a registry key may be set to default to the OEM search wrapper when the user first runs a search.   By setting the key HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PCHealth\\HelpSvc\\WrapperDisplay (type = string) with the GUID of a search wrapper, it will override the retail default search settings for which wrapper is opened and replace that default wrapper with the search wrapper whose GUID was set in the registry key.  If this key is deleted, it will restore the original default setting. Additional parameters specified in the HSC SDK define how a search provider registers a search wrapper and can use attributes to customize error messages and advanced search options.  Depending on the type of search engine employed by the search provider, it may be desirable to set custom advanced search options.  For example, the Microsoft Knowledge Based search wrapper allows users to select whether they want to search by exact phrase, any word, all words, or perform a Boolean search.  It also allows users to select a product or technology within which to scope their search, such as games or multimedia.   NET Search Wrapper A Net Search Wrapper is a specialized search wrapper that has been written to ease the integration of Web-based search engines into the Search Engine Manager. The Net Search Wrapper achieves this by standardizing on the query mechanism and XML data transfer of the results. The Net search wrapper is an alternative to building a search wrapper from scratch, as most the basic elements are already defined.   If you would like to make use of an online store of data, such as a searchable online knowledge base, the NET search wrapper may be a viable option for you.  For example, Microsoft leverages the NET search wrapper to manage results from the Microsoft Knowledge Base within Help and Support Center.   In addition, advanced search options for the NET search wrapper can be retrieved from a remote configuration file that can be updated online with the search service.  HSC retrieves the settings when the user is online, and appropriately deals with the user s connection when they are not online and the NET search wrapper is unavailable. For more information about writing and registering either a generic search wrapper, or a NET search wrapper, please refer to the PCHealth Fest exercises. HSC Subsites Subsites Overview The resources highlighted on the HSC home page are task areas with a specific focus.   [Support] connects users with support tools and applications to resolve their issues with product support engineers. [Windows Update] delivers software and driver updates from the Internet. [Tools] provides a central area for users to access system and administrative tools, targeted towards IT professionals and administrators. [Compatible Hardware and Software] allows users to check which hardware and software has been tested to work with Windows XP. [Error and Event Log Messages] provides a focused search on error message explanations and resolutions, targeted towards IT professionals and administrators (this subsite is only accessible from the server SKUs). Support Subsite This is the subsite that aggregates all possible assisted support within Help and Support Center.  The list of support options in the left side of the Main Window Area is generated automatically and modifications must be made by adding support channels.  Support channels are support URLs added via the Support Automation Framework.  All registered support channels display on the left side of the Support subsite. Support Subsite Opportunities OEM can add any number of support channels.  These are listed on the left side of the subsite. OEM can remove the Microsoft PSS Support Channel. Support Subsite Criteria OEM cannot remove links (except PSS link) from the Support subsite. Support Subsite Recommendations At a minimum, OEMs should create a support channel with the contact information for their support organization.  Tools Subsite The Tools subsite provides an access point in HSC for all support and administrative tools installed on Windows XP.  In addition, if the user has access to additional tools after installing the Resource Kit, access and help files for those tools are dynamically added to the Tools subsite. The left navigation area of the Tools subsite can be extended to highlight OEM and enterprise tools.  In addition, tools or content pages can be added to the lower-level content buckets. In the same way that the OEM would extend the main HSC taxonomy on the home page, the Production Tool would be used to extend the taxonomy for the Tools subsite. First, the OEM can add items to the list of tools on the left side of the Main Window Area in the Tools subsite.  This is done through the Production Tool in the <System> section at the top level. Second, OEMs can extend the pages that make up the My Computer Information section of the Tools subsite. These changes must be additive and not omit nor change any Microsoft information already provided there. Unless otherwise specified, all other tools provided by Microsoft must not be modified by the OEM. Tools Subsite Opportunities OEM can add tools to the subsite (which will display on the left side). OEM can extend the following information pages: My Computer Information Summary My Computer Information Status My Computer Information Hardware Tools Subsite Criteria OEM cannot change or remove existing data or information in the Tools subsite Tools Subsite Recommendations OEMs should look at the data being provided by Microsoft in the Tools subsite before commencing customization to make sure no duplication of work occurs.  Additionally, for both the user s benefit and simplification of OEM customization, data presented specific to the OEM should be done by extending existing pages as opposed to creating new pages within the Tools subsite. My Computer Information My Computer Information in Help and Support Center uses WMI to access hardware and software information and display it in a user-friendly way.  By changing the style sheets, OEMs will be able to modify the colors that these pages render with, but none of the existing information can be omitted. There are many order specific criteria here   this is done to ensure supportability of the My Computer Information Pages. My Computer Information Opportunities OEM can insert links at the bottom of My Computer Information pages.  OEM can add rows to existing My Computer Information tables. OEM can add tables to existing My Computer Information pages. My Computer Information Criteria OEM cannot delete any existing information in My Computer Information. OEM cannot change the order of any existing information. Additional rows must be added at the bottom of existing rows. Additional tables must be added at the bottom of existing tables. My Computer Information Start Page This is the first page of My Computer Information.  OEMs can add links to this page.  However, the same style must persist and all links must have the same appearance and prominence.  OEM links must be inserted before or after the list of Microsoft links. My Computer Information Summary Information This page gives the user a quick summary of her computer and her environment.   This information is generated automatically via system metrics and cannot be extended by the OEM. Rows can be added to the bottom of existing tables.  Additional tables can be added at the bottom of the page. My Computer Information Status This page summarizes the elements on the user s computer that can be diagnosed or updated by Windows.  This includes peripherals and hardware such as hard drives, video cards, and sound cards.  There are links on this page that allows users to update drivers or software, or run troubleshooters or diagnostics relating to a particular component. Rows can be added to the bottom of existing tables.  Additional tables can be added at the bottom of the page. Existing hyperlinks can be changed to different destinations. My Computer Information Hardware This page displays hardware manufacturer and driver information.  Rows can be added to the bottom of existing tables.  Additional tables can be added at the bottom of the page. My Computer Information Software This page shows available software information, as well as any services running in Windows. This information is generated automatically via system metrics and cannot be extended by the OEM. My Computer Information Advanced System Information This page loads the ActiveX version of System Information and other prepackaged information components. These are advanced controls and pages that generate very specific and detailed computer information, often used by support professionals. OEMs can extend the Advanced System Information view by adding their own entries to the tree view of categories. This extension is accomplished by exposing the desired information through WMI and creating a DLL with a specific entry point for System Information. Details can be found in Appendix B of this document. Index Subsite OEMs can add content to the Index by supplying a Compiled HTM (CHM) HHK file that has index information about OEM content.  When packaged with a CAB, the HHK file is merged upon update and the OEM content will appear with all other Index entries. There is no prioritization among Index providers and all entries have the same prominence. The left side of the Main Window Area in the Index subsite is not extensible or changeable by OEMs.   Options Subsite The [Options] link on the NavBar opens the Options subsite, which currently hosts Help and Support Options, Search Options, and Share Windows Help. The following outlines how the Options appear in the Options subsite: Help and Support Options [  ] Show History in navigation bar [  ] Show Favorites in navigation bar [  ] Start Help and Support Center in full screen Search Options [ Automatically generated list of search options by provider ] Share Windows Help [ Defined in Remote Help spec ] - Switch Help Version - Install shared Help - Install Help from Disk - Share Help - Remove Help Options Subsite Opportunities OEM can add more options to the subsite (which will display on the left side). OEM can extend the following existing Options: OEM can add options to Help and Support Options Search Options are automatically updated when OEM search is added via Extensible Search. Options Subsite Criteria OEM cannot remove any existing options. Additions to the left side must appear at the bottom of the Options list. OEM cannot extend Share Windows Help options. Options Subsite Suggestions The Options subsite is designed to host any additional settings or options the OEM needs to expose to the user.  As is a common theme in HSC, unification of Microsoft and OEM elements makes for a much simpler and intuitive user experience. Any OEM settings, switches, or configuration options that need exposure in HSC should be placed in the Options subsite. Favorites Subsite The Favorites subsite is not extensible or changeable by OEMs.  Any inherited styles from the global CSS will be reflected, however.  From within the Options subsite, the user can choose to display or hide [Favorites] in the NavBar.   History Subsite The History subsite is not extensible or changeable by OEMs.  Any inherited styles from the global CSS will be reflected, however. From within the Options subsite, the user can choose to display or hide [History] in the NavBar.  The session object will still track HSC usage, however, so such data can be uploaded with a Support Automation Framework incident. Compatible Hardware and Software The Compatible Hardware and Software subsite provides an area for users to check hardware and software compatibility with Windows, in an effort to avoid compatibility issues before purchasing or upgrading devices or software programs. Application and hardware compatibility issues are among the top support call generators for Microsoft Product Support Services.   The Compatible Hardware and Software subsite is a database search based on IHV and ISV content acquired through the software and hardware logo programs, and on test information verified by Microsoft.  Vendors make their data available to the Compatible Hardware and Software subsite by participating in the logo programs.  See http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest and http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/partners for more information. OEMs will not be able to customize the Compatible Hardware and Software subsite. Windows Update Subsite Windows Update is not updateable or extensible by OEMs through HSC customization. Adding Subsites OEMs have the ability to extend HSC to include additional subsites and functionality, and also to augment some of the existing subsites.  OEMs should employ the same subsite design as provided by existing subsites.   The customization process is simplified by copying code from existing Microsoft subsites, and then changing the new OEM subsite(s) to suit the needs of the added functionality within Help and Support Center.  More information is in Appendix B. Headlines Headlines Overview The Headlines or  Did You Know?  area of HSC provides a venue where online product support topics can be exposed to end-users without requiring a Help Center update.  This allows content providers to deliver timely information on security issues or support articles, and helps demonstrate to the user that HSC contains dynamic content.   Headlines Components The headlines area on the home page consists of four headline slots followed by a link to a supplemental page. These headlines are positioned as such: Retail version: Microsoft Headline 1 Microsoft Headline 2 Microsoft Headline 3 Optional   headline driven from HCUpdate package installation Link to more headlines (additional headlines page)   A customized version might look like this: Microsoft Headline 1 OEM Headline 1 OEM Headline 2 Optional   headline driven from HCUpdate package installation Link to more headlines (additional headlines page) The headlines that supply slots 2 and 3 are pulled from a specific file posted on the OEM Web site.  The location of this file is specified in the XML manifest that describes which headlines files will appear on both the home page and the supplemental (a.k.a.  View more headlines ) page.   On the  View more headlines  page, headlines are enumerated in blocks organized by the authority or Web site providing the headlines.  This is designed such that different providers can keep their headlines separated out, and the customized version can contain a specialized mix of both Microsoft and OEM headlines that best accommodates the user group. Each block on the  View more headlines  page identifies the content provider for the headlines and provides space for a URL and logo for that provider.  OEMs or enterprises customizing HSC can choose to subscribe to the headlines provided by Microsoft, or can customize this area to provide their own headline  blocks  or providers.   Headlines Subsite Logos Logos can be presented on the  View more headlines  page per block or provider and can be used for content provider branding.  If no image URL is provided in the news block file, the image will be blank.  The client code forces the size of the image space, but does not validate the image size as it pulls it in, so content providers will be responsible for assuring that their image meets the height and width requirements.  Otherwise the image will be distorted to fit in the allotted space.   There are three options for logo display: Image Square   height=48, width=48 Image long horizontal   height=4, width=200 Image long vertical   height=96, width=48 Headlines Title, Description, Last Updated When HSC detects an Internet connection and new headlines files are available from the news service, HSC automatically updates the headlines on the HSC home page.  The headlines are not archived beyond the last cached version, (deeper archiving is being considered for future versions of HSC).  When HSC refreshes headlines, the last updated date near the title of the headlines block is updated, pulling the date from one of the service files. Headlines Setup Instructions To create your own headlines area, you must create the necessary online files to support the service and then edit the local system file to point to your online files.   Local Headlines Files In the client s %windir%/pchealth/helpctr/config/ directory, newsset.xml determines where it should look to retrieve headlines files from the Web, how often it should check for updates, and the date that it last looked for updates.  This file will need to be updated to point to the headlines manifest (newsver.xml), which determines specifically which headlines should be downloaded on the OEM machine. Online Headlines Files The first file is the news version file (newsver.xml), which informs the client (newsset.xml) if new updates are available and how often to check back for updates.  Headlines should be refreshed monthly at a minimum, however daily, weekly or bi-weekly refreshes can also be set in the newsver.xml file.   The following is a sample format for the newsver.xml file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <NEWSVER URL="" FREQUENCY="14">    <LANGUAGE LCID="1033">       <SKU VERSION="Personal"> <NEWSBLOCK OEM="1" URL="http://www.mywebsite.com/windowsxp/newsblock01.xml"/>         <NEWSBLOCK URL=" http://www.mywebsite.com/windowsxp/newsblock02.xml "/>       </SKU>       <SKU VERSION=" Professional ">  <NEWSBLOCK URL="http://www.mywebsite.com/windowsxp/newsblock01.xml"/>  <NEWSBLOCK URL="http://www.mywebsite.com/windowsxp/newsblock02.xml"/>        </SKU>      </LANGUAGE> </NEWSVER> To elect one of the blocks of headlines to show on the home page, add the OEM attribute to the newsblock as noted in red above.  This will change the UI display to function as described in the customized example in section 7.2.   The newsver.xml also informs the client where to poll for headlines to display on the HSC home page.  The following is a sample format for one of the provider headline files (known as a newsblock file): <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <NEWSHEADLINES>    <NEWSBLOCK  PROVIDER = "Exercise 4 News"  = "app:http://www.microsoft.com/windows/"  = "http://windows.microsoft.com/windowsxp/en/professional/headlines/rpic.gif"  POSITION = "recommended"  FREQUENCY = "1" > <HEADLINE  ICON  = ""  TITLE = "Discover MyApp" LINK  = "hcp://CN=HSSTest,L=Redmond,S=Washington,C=US/MyAppHelp.htm"  DESCRIPTION= "Discovering the joys of MyApp"  EXPIRES = "1/15/2002" />        <HEADLINE  ICON  = TITLE = "MyApp Troubleshooting"  LINK  = "app:http://www.microsoft.com/windows/"  DESCRIPTION = "What to do when MyApp doesn't work" EXPIRES = "1/15/2002"/>        <HEADLINE  ICON  = ""  TITLE = "MyApp Update Notes"  LINK  = "app:http://www.microsoft.com/windows/"  DESCRIPTION = "Latest update for MyApp"  EXPIRES = "1/15/2002"/>    </NEWSBLOCK> </NEWSHEADLINES> As URLs are set in these files, headlines can reside on any Internet server of the OEM s choosing.  Headlines can also link to help and support topics on the local system.  Many times support engineers inform us that the answers to common customer questions are available in the help content, but users are not locating it.  By cycling these types of topics onto the home page, customers may independently find answers to their problems that they otherwise might have missed, thus saving OEMs and Microsoft support calls. Disabling the Headlines Feature The headlines feature can be disabled such that it is removed from the Help and Support Center home page.  However, since this feature provides a value-added service to HSC customers, we strongly encourage keeping the headlines feature enabled so that users can get access to timely support information.  If you do not customize this feature, the HSC headlines provided by Microsoft will still be available to your users. If your support policy dictates that you cannot take advantage of the headlines feature and you must disable it, please contact the PCHealth team at pchealth@microsoft.com and we will be happy to work with you on your request.    HCUpdate Headlines When updating the local help on the user s machine, it s helpful to have a place on the home page to notify the user of the installation or point them to the newly installed help resources.  The optional or situational fourth home page headline slot is reserved for this function.  To install a headline to the home page you need to specify the following in an .xml file to be packaged in your HCUpdate cab: Title   text for the headline  location of the page or content the headline should reference Timeout   duration in days the headline should remain on the home page Other headline attributes like description or content provider are not displayed on the home page Only one HCUpdate headline is allowed on the home page at one time.  If the user installs a second package that would replace the first HCUpdate headline, the first headline will be bumped to a block on the  View more headlines  page reserved for  Recent Updates. For information on how to set the package_description.xml file for your HCUpdate package to install a headline to the home page, please see the HSC SDK or PCHealth Fest Exercise 4. Content Guidelines Help and Support Center is not designed to be a product marketing space, but rather a user assistance portal.  Therefore headlines included in this area need to adhere to the content quality and purpose goals for HSC.  The headlines must remain free from marketing-related or gratuitous content that does not directly help the user to perform a specific task in Windows.  Headlines should be guided by users  most immediate needs for help and support content.  This would include responding to top support issues as reported by customers via support channels.   The headlines that are provided by Microsoft are determined by a Content Advisory Board, overseen by a managing editor.  The managing editor serves the purpose of a gatekeeper to ensure that the content quality guidelines mentioned above are followed, that headlines have a consistent voice, tone, and style, and finally that content is never redundant.  We encourage other content providers to follow a similar model if possible to allow for the highest quality and most consistent headlines possible.   If a headline is found to persist for more than a few updates, it should be considered for inclusion in the local store of content (e.g. a Help update) since its continued priority suggests that it would be an issue of ongoing interest to the customer (online or offline).   More Headlines Information For detailed exercises on how to create and post headlines as well as sample files, please refer to the PCHealth Fest Exercises, Exercise 4. Additional HSC Content Windows XP Resource Kit Resource Kit content will be automatically added to the HSC taxonomy when the user has installed the Resource Kit from a CD or from the Web.  The content in the Resource Kit taxonomy cannot be extended. Appendix Abstracted Home Page [Appendix A] The PC Health team has exposed more opportunities for OEMs who will deploy Help and Support Center as the sole assistance-providing application on their customers  Windows XP computers.  Microsoft believes this to be a slightly inferior user experience when compared to the Integrated Home Page experience (discussed below).  This sentiment is based upon usability tests conducted at Microsoft Usability Labs.  However, Microsoft also respects the needs of individual OEMs and their position regarding their direct customers.  Thus, the Microsoft PC Health team has made accommodations for the HSC home page. Using a third party technology does not preclude the OEM from customizing the home page in this fashion, but the user experience must be contained primarily within the HSC application.  OEM content can assert or pop-up other windows from within HSC, but user flow must not switch back and forth between some other application and Help and Support Center.  Again based upon usability data, Microsoft feels the user experience is diminished when users have to interact with varying usage models. If the OEM customizes the home page in the abstracted fashion, the following prerequisites must be met: All instantiations of HSC must open to the Abstracted Home Page. All hardware buttons (KB, Computer chassis, monitor chassis, etc.) that instantiate HSC must also open to the Abstracted Home Page. All help and diagnostic content exposed to the user most be done so through HSC or through a Web experience initiated from within Help and Support Center. It is important to note that all other requirements and obligations in this Customization Guide apply to all customized versions of Help and Support Center.  Exemptions for the Abstracted Home Page are solely for the purpose for home page layout and do not imply any other exemptions for requirements in this document. Abstracted Home Page Opportunities The Abstracted Home Page allows for more customization.  The OEM will define the home page layout, but must include the required Microsoft elements and links.  The customization here applies only to the Main Window Area. Criteria for the NavBar and Header Area are unchanged from earlier definitions in this document. Abstracted Home Page Criteria The OEM who chooses to customize HSC and use an Abstracted Home Page design must conform to the following criteria.  This applies to all initial, future, and ongoing shipments of Help and Support Center in Windows. The link to the Taxonomy subsite must be one of the most prominent links on the home page. Headlines must be on the home page (contrary to Integrated Home Page). The link to all requisite [Help and Support Resources] must be on the home page: Tools Remote Assistance Windows Update Compatible Hardware and Software No product or service advertising is permitted. Taxonomy Subsite The Taxonomy link on the Abstracted Home Page [Pick a Help Topic] would take the user to a page devoted to the taxonomy of help content, the Taxonomy subsite.  The OEM has the same opportunities to extend and customize the taxonomy as defined earlier in this document.  Microsoft reserves the right to possibly add additional links on the right side of this page, and the OEM will not be able to customize the right side of this page. Help and Support Resources Subsite The [Help and Support Resources] link on the Abstracted Home Page would take the user to a page devoted to the additional services and subsites available within Help and Support Center.  This includes Remote Assistance, System Restore, Windows Update, Tools, Support, and Compatible Hardware and Software.  The OEM will be able to extend the left side of this page, but none of the Microsoft-provided links or tasks can be removed. Abstracted Home Page Suggestions The Abstracted Home Page should be implemented only if the Integrated Home Page absolutely will not work for the OEM. Is should be noted that Microsoft has conducted usability tests regarding the usefulness of either design, and data indicates the Integrated Home Page was found to be more navigable and orienting than the Abstracted Home Page design.

Help and Support Center is, for the most part, an HTML Application that builds its UI from Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTML pages, and script.  Some elements also include ActiveX objects and binary behaviors.  Developers customizing HSC should have a fair basic knowledge of HTML using CSS and a moderate understanding of JavaScript.  Unless otherwise specified, HSC JavaScript and code that generates any portion of the application UI must persist and must not be changed by the OEM prior to, nor after delivery of, Windows XP to end users. Microsoft is licensing Windows XP to OEMs as a product, not as source code, even though source is exposed in the product.  All code included in the HSC application is copyrighted by Microsoft. HSC Style Sheets Help and Support Center uses generic Windows XP style sheets in combination with local style sheets to define the colors, font, and styles of the UI.  You should not modify the style sheets that are part of HSC, but you may add style sheets where appropriate. Help and Support Center uses a runtime-generated style sheet named shared.css.  This is a virtual file that does not exist on the file system.  Shared.css is created when HSC launches. This style sheet is comprehensive and contains all fonts, styles, and colors used in the HSC application.  Shared.css should be used in UI pages added to HSC and styles within should be referenced by individual elements within the HTML.  This need not apply to content pages added to HSC, but would work just as well. Since shared.css is generated automatically, there is no opportunity to modify the file directly.  Shared.xml is a resource that HSC audits before generating shared.css. To affect changes into shared.css, shared.xml must be created and added to the \pchealth\helpctr\system\css folder.  This file simply has <CLASS> entries that map to the classes defined in shared.css.  Shared.xml has two primary sections, LUNA and CLASSIC.  These sections allow HSC to have a classic appearance when selected by the user in display properties.  They should be thought of as CLASSIC and OTHER, LUNA being used in all appearances other than CLASSIC. Form of Shared.xml Shared.xml has five primary types of CLASS elements: FONT, COLOR, BGCOLOR, GRADIENT, and HYPERLINK. FONT defines a family (typeface), size, and weight (bold). COLOR defines the foreground text or element color. BGCOLOR defines the background color.  BGCOLOR elements can be replaced with GRADIENT. GRADIENT defines a two-color horizontal or vertical gradient in some background space. HYPERLINK defines the normal color, hover color, and underline behavior of hyperlinks. Values in shared.xml are the same as used in HTML, You can define any of the font families, weights, sizes, colors, etc. that are understood in HTML.  However, if you want some element to match a common system font, for example, the message box, you can define the font family as  messagebox. Sample of shared.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>  <STYLESHEET>   <THEME NAME="Luna">     <CLASS NAME=".sys-font-body" TYPE="FONT">       <!-- used throughout the HSC, primary font that all information uses  -->        <FAMILY>Verdana</FAMILY>      </CLASS>     <CLASS NAME=".sys-font-body-bold" TYPE="FONT">       <!-- bold variant of the body text font -->        <FAMILY>Verdana</FAMILY>        <WEIGHT>bold</WEIGHT>      </CLASS>     <CLASS NAME=".sys-color-body" TYPE="COLOR">       <!-- color of normal text (usually black) -->        <VALUE>#000000</VALUE>      </CLASS>   </THEME>   <THEME NAME="Classic">     <CLASS NAME=".sys-font-body" TYPE="FONT">       <!-- used throughout the HSC, primary font that all information uses  -->        <FAMILY>messagebox</FAMILY>      </CLASS>     <CLASS NAME=".sys-font-body-bold" TYPE="FONT">       <!-- bold variant of the body text font -->        <FAMILY>messagebox</FAMILY>        <WEIGHT>bold</WEIGHT>      </CLASS>   </THEME> </STYLESHEET> Of course, shared.xml is much longer and has full coverage of all classes, but this should indicate the simplicity of the XML in the file. Referencing shared.css Your pages should have a style sheet reference in the header that looks like the following:   <LINK ID=Stylesheet_Ref0 href=hcp://system/css/shared.css rel=STYLESHEET type=text/css> Having the reference to shared.css, you will be able to use any of the classes defined there:   <DIV ID=Text_013 CLASS= sys-font-body >This is normal text.</DIV> To use multiple classes, separate the classes with a space in the CLASS attribute of an element:   <LINK ID=Text_013 CLASS= sys-font-body sys-color-body >This is colored text.</DIV> To test any changes to shared.xml, closing and restarting HSC will apply changes to the UI.  Again, shared.xml needs to be in the %WINDIR%\pchealth\helpctr\system\css folder. A sample shared.xml should accompany this document.  If a copy is needed, request a  sample version of shared.xml  by sending email to pchealth@microsoft.com. Navigation Bar The NavBar is an ActiveX object hosted in navbar.htm, which actually includes the NavBar and Header Area. Navbar.xml defines the structure of the ActiveX object and navbar.htm actually displays the NavBar and handles navigation of HSC through script.  The NavBar elements are simply defined by the <button> entries in the navbar.xml.  To add a NavBar element, simply add a <button> XML block in navbar.xml.  The ordering of the <button> entries is significant and the first block in navbar.xml will be the element on the far left of the NavBar.  Order will be mirrored automatically for RTL languages. A <button> entry in navbar.xml looks like the following: <BUTTON ID="NEWBUTTON" ACCESSKEY="B" ENABLED="true" VISIBLE="false" TYPE="GENERIC"> <IMAGE_NORMAL>hcp://system/images/new.jpg</IMAGE_NORMAL> <IMAGE_HOT hcp://system/images/new.jpg </IMAGE_HOT> <TEXT>New &amp;Button</TEXT> <TOOLTIP>This button has been added by your OEM</TOOLTIP> </BUTTON> Unique identifier for use by script in navbar.htm AccessKey Unique hotkey that activates button when Alt+AccessKey is pressed Enabled Button is visible but grayed (disabled) when enabled= false Visible Button is not displayed on NavBar when visible= false Specifies the type of button   use  GENERIC  for additional buttons Image_normal URI of button image to display when button is visible and enabled Image_hot URI of button image to display when hovered over with mouse Visible text. Ampersand (&amp;) precedes AccessKey to underline ToolTip Visible text that appears in screen tip when hovered over with mouse To enable buttons added to navbar.xml, you must modify JavaScript in navbar.htm.  This describes which code section to modify and how to add JavaScript there. You will need to modify the ProcessToolbarCommands() function in navbar.htm by adding a CASE entry to the switch() statement in the function.  The order is not significant, but it is recommended you add any CASE entries between the  support  and  search  CASE entries.  Your entry should look like the following: case "NEWBUTTON": pchealth.HelpSession.ChangeContext( "subsite",  TopLevel_2\OEM_Bucket break; You must use the ChangeContext() function to switch context in the Main Window Area. There are three arguments for ChangeContext(): Context, Taxonomy Location, and URI.  The first argument, Context, is required and the others are optional. To change to a subsite in the taxonomy with a specific node and URI loaded:   pchealth.HelpSession.ChangeContext( "subsite",  TopLevel_2\OEM_Bucket A valid taxonomy location is a  category  in the taxonomy database. A valid URI is any http:// or hcp:// or any other Universal Resource Identifier recognized by the system. To change to any URI across the entire Main Window Area:   pchealth.HelpSession.ChangeContext("fullwindow", "", "URI" ); The second argument is intentionally null in this usage.  It is suggested that the URI in this case is a frameset for a left- and right-side pages for consistency with Help and Support Center. Any number of elements can be added to the NavBar.  Buttons will become hidden when the HSC window is resized to a point where there is insufficient space to display all buttons completely.  Buttons will be hidden in an order starting with the rightmost element.  However, a double chevron [>>] will appear so the user still has access to all NavBar functionality. Header Area The Header Area of the UI is actually coded in navbar.htm.  This file references shared.css and behaviors.css for its layout and styles.  Only navbar.htm need be modified to customize the header region of Help and Support Center.  The HTML in this file (before the script) is very short and simple.  The layout is based upon tables and styles drawn from shared.css, with some local styles defined for element placement and alignment. There is only one HelpCenter behavior used in navbar.htm and it is the behavior that allows for mouse-hover and mouse-click switching of bitmap images.  It is used to highlight the search button upon hover, and for depression visualization upon click. To replace the HSC image with a different logo, the third cell in the header table needs to be changed from: <TD ROWSPAN=1 VALIGN=middle ALIGN=right WIDTH=100% id=noloc2>   <helpcenter:bitmap id=noloc3 tabIndex=-1 class=Logo SRCNORMAL=hcp://system/images/32x32/logo.bmp></helpcenter:bitmap> </TD> to something like the following: <TD ROWSPAN=1 VALIGN=middle ALIGN=right WIDTH=100% id=noloc2>   <IMG SRC= hcp://system/images/NewLogo.jpg </TD> The alignment and layout can be modified to suit particular needs, but it is strongly recommended that the Search element persist on the left side of the Header Area. The title of the HSC application can be changed, but the minor text needs be changed to include the Help and Support Center name.  The minor text includes the Windows XP SKU version by default, and must include both if the HSC title is changed. To change the application name and use the default layout, change the default code: <DIV id=idAppLogo2 class="LogoSKU sys-font-heading2" NOWRAP>Help and Support Center</DIV> to the following: <DIV id=idAppLogo2 class="LogoSKU sys-font-heading2" NOWRAP>New OEM-specified name</DIV> To modify the minor text, change the existing JavaScript code from: idAppLogo3.innerText = pchealth.UserSettings.CurrentSKU.DisplayName; to the following: idAppLogo3.innerText =  Microsoft Help and Support Center   + pchealth.UserSettings.CurrentSKU.DisplayName; The Header Area should be one of the easiest regions to customize with the largest yield, given its ubiquity throughout the application. Home Page The HSC home page actually exists as two separate file versions.  Because of the [Share Windows Help] feature, it is necessary for the server version of the home page to exist on the Professional SKU, and vice versa.  Changes made to the home page should be made to both Hompage__Desktop.htm and  Homepage__Server.htm.  Both home page versions have a layout based upon TABLE and DIV elements.  The left and right sides of the page are simply cells in a two-column table.  When customizing the home page, it may be useful to turn the table borders on <table border= > to see the UI layout and separation.  Some elements are changeable while others are either encapsulated in binary behaviors or unchangeable based upon the requirements of this document. Again, it is important to note that the two home page versions contain code for desktop and server SKUs of Windows XP for scenarios where users switch between desktop and server help with [Share Windows Help].  It is important to maintain both sections when customizing the UI. Home page left side The left side of the HSC home page is mostly unchangeable.  The taxonomy is generated by script and loads its contents directly from the HSC database.  The OEM must not modify the script that generates the taxonomy.  Of course, content can be inserted to the database and will appear on the left side of the home page, but changing the home page will not accomplish this. All the examples here reference Homepage__Desktop.htm.  Changes to Homepage__Server.htm will be similar. To obtain the most useable space for customization, removing the first row of the home page table is recommended.  However, you must move the titles,  Pick a Task  and  Ask for Assistance,  into the lower cell above the taxonomy list. This is simply done by moving the DIV elements into the lower cell. This is the code in the home page prior to any change: <TABLE border=0 id=idTopLevelTable cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 WIDTH=100% class="sys-homepage-color">   <TD WIDTH="40%" VALIGN=middle>     <DIV ID=locLeftTitle NOWRAP class="sys-font-heading2" style="padding-left: 10px">Pick a Help topic</DIV>   </TD>   <TD WIDTH="60%" VALIGN=middle style="padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px">     <DIV ID=locRightTitle NOWRAP class="sys-font-heading2">Ask for assistance</DIV>   </TD> </TR>   <TD WIDTH="40%" VALIGN=top>     <DIV id=idTaxo style="margin: 8px"></DIV>   </TD>   <TD WIDTH="60%" VALIGN=top>     <DIV style="margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_RA> Removing the top row and moving the  Pick a Task  and  Ask for Assistance  titles would yield the following: <TABLE border=0 id=idTopLevelTable cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 WIDTH=100% class="sys-homepage-color">   <TD WIDTH="40%" VALIGN=top>     <DIV ID=locLeftTitle NOWRAP class="sys-font-heading2" style="padding-left: 10px">Pick a Help topic</DIV>     <DIV id=idTaxo style="margin: 8px"></DIV>   </TD>   <TD WIDTH="60%" VALIGN=top>     <DIV ID=locRightTitle NOWRAP class="sys-font-heading2">Ask for assistance</DIV>     <DIV style="margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_RA> This makes the left and right sides vertically contiguous HTML segments, allowing for a much easier modification of the right side. Home page right side The right side of the HSC Home Page is very changeable.  Excepting the requirements of mandatory links and the inclusion of the Headlines, the layout of the right side is defined by the OEM. The retail layout of the right side is very straightforward, with a simple vertical progression of elements. This works well for Microsoft, but laying out the right side can be improved by the use of one or more tables. The following sample is a good start for the right side cell: <TABLE border=0 cellPadding=0 width=100% cellSpacing=0 class="sys-homepage-color"> <TD Colspan=2>   <DIV id=OEMCustomization class="sys-font-heading2 sys-header-bgcolor" style="padding-left: 5px; height: 230px; color: #FFFFFF">   OEM Customization   </DIV> </TD> </TR> <TD Colspan=2>   <DIV id=HSCCenters class="sys-font-heading2 sys-homepage-color">Help and Support Centers</DIV> </TD> </TR> <TD align=left valign=top>     <DIV style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_RA>       <A id=center_RA_a class="sys-link-homepage sys-font-body" href='hcp://services/centers/support?topic=hcp%3A//CN%3DMicrosoft%2520Corporation%2CL%3DRedmond%2CS%3DWashington%2CC%3DUS/Remote%2520Assistance/Escalation/Common/rcscreen1.htm' TITLE="Send an invitation to a computer expert you know, and let them connect to your computer to help you solve problems.">         <helpcenter:bitmap class="layout-arrow" SRCNORMAL="hcp://system/images/16x16/arrow_green_normal_shadow.bmp"></helpcenter:bitmap>         <B>Remote Assistance</B>       </A>     </DIV> </TD> <TD align=left valign=top>     <DIV style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_COMPAT TITLE="Search here whether you're shopping for new hardware or software, or want to know if what you already have is compatible with Windows XP.">       <A id=center_COMPAT_a class="sys-link-homepage sys-font-body" href="javascript:SafeCenterConnect( 'compatctr', L_TopicTitleCompat_Text, L_TopicIntroCompat_Text )">         <helpcenter:bitmap class="layout-arrow" SRCNORMAL="hcp://system/images/16x16/arrow_green_normal_shadow.bmp"></helpcenter:bitmap>         <B>Compatible hardware and software</B>       </A>     </DIV> </TD> </TR> <TD align=left valign=top>     <DIV style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_UPDATE TITLE="Choose from a selection of the latest updates tailored just for your computer's operating system, software, and hardware.">       <A id=center_UPDATE_a class="sys-link-homepage sys-font-body" href="javascript:SafeCenterConnect( 'updatectr', L_TopicTitleWU_Text, L_TopicIntroWU_Text )">         <helpcenter:bitmap class="layout-arrow" SRCNORMAL="hcp://system/images/16x16/arrow_green_normal_shadow.bmp"></helpcenter:bitmap>         <B>Windows Update</B>       </A>     </DIV> </TD> <TD align=left valign=top>     <DIV style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" id=center_TOOLS TITLE="Keep your computer running smoothly with helpful tools such as My Computer Information and System Configuration Utility.">       <A id=center_TOOLS_a class="sys-link-homepage sys-font-body" href="hcp://services/subsite?node=_System_/Tools_Center&topic=hcp://system/blurbs/tools.htm">         <helpcenter:bitmap class="layout-arrow" SRCNORMAL="hcp://system/images/16x16/arrow_green_normal_shadow.bmp"></helpcenter:bitmap>         <B>Tools</B>       </A>     </DIV> </TD> </TR> <TD colspan=2>     <DIV ID=idNews style="display:none">       <DIV NOWRAP style="padding-top: 9px" id=noloc2>         <SPAN ID=idNews_Title class='sys-font-heading2 sys-homepage-color'>Did you know?</SPAN>         <SPAN ID=noloc3 style='font-size: 1px; width: 10px'></SPAN>         <SPAN ID=idNews_Status class='sys-font-body'></SPAN>       </DIV>       <DIV ID=idNews_Body></DIV>       <DIV ID=idNews_Error style="margin-top: 5px; display:none">         <DIV ID=locNotConnected class='sys-font-body'>            When you are connected to the Internet, this area will display links to timely help and support information.

It is the cell on the home page that begins with <TD WIDTH="60%" VALIGN=top>.  Adding Subsites All subsites in HSC are two-panel sites in the Main Window Area, with a left and right panel.  The left side is used for searching and navigating, while the right side is where help content is displayed and interactive troubleshooters or help applications are used.  While it is possible for OEMs to define interaction that spans the entire Main Window Area, we hope that any extension of HSC follows the left-right interaction paradigm. To that end, any subsites added to HSC should be a frameset. The following is a simple template that would work: <HTML>   <FRAMESET cols="30%, *">     <FRAME name= subsite_links  scrolling="no" src="subpanels/NewLeftSide.htm">     <FRAME name= content_display  src="../blurbs/NewRightSide.htm">   </FRAMESET> </HTML> Hyperlinks originate from the left side HTML NewLeftSide.htm in this example. Subsite left side The left side should be a list of navigation links for the user to quickly move about the subsite.  You can see an example of this in any HSC subsite.  The following sample code would work well as a template for the left panel: <BODY class="sys-lhp-bgcolor" style="margin: 11px" scroll=no onselectstart="return false;"> <TABLE border=0 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 WIDTH=100% HEIGHT=100% style="table-layout: fixed"> <TR WIDTH=100%>   <DIV style='width: 100%; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; border : 1pt solid'        class='sys-font-body sys-toppane-color-border sys-toppane-header-color sys-toppane-header-bgcolor'> <DIV style='padding: 0.5em 11px'>   <A class='sys-link-header sys-font-body-bold' tabIndex=1 href="hcp://system/blurbs/history.htm" target="HelpCtrContents">New Subsite Title</A> </DIV>   </DIV> </TD> </TR>   <TD HEIGHT=100%>     <DIV class='sys-font-body sys-toppane-color-border sys-toppane-bgcolor'          style='width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto; border-left : 1pt solid;           border-bottom : 1pt solid; border-right : 1pt solid; padding: 11px'>     <!-- put your left-side content within this element -->     <!-- Your hyperlinks should include [target= content_display ] to display on the right. -->     </DIV>   </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </BODY> Assembling the CAB file To install the new or modified files, they must be packaged into a CAB file with the appropriate package_description.xml.  The XML descriptor instructs HCUpdate how to install the files onto the Windows XP computer.  The following package_description.xml example would install the desktop homepage and the NavBar on the computer: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  <HELPCENTERPACKAGE>   <VERSION VALUE="1.95" />    <PRODUCT ID="BVT Cab Company" />    <SKU VALUE="DESKTOP" />    <LANGUAGE VALUE="ALL" />    <INSTALL_CONTENT>     <FILE ACTION="ADD" SYS="TRUE" SOURCE="homepage__DESKTOP.htm" URI="homepage__DESKTOP.htm" />      <FILE ACTION="ADD" SYS="TRUE" SOURCE="navbar.htm" URI="panels/navbar.htm" />      <FILE ACTION="ADD" SYS="TRUE" SOURCE="navbar.xml" URI="panels/navbar.xml" />    </INSTALL_CONTENT>   <TRUSTED_CONTENT>     <TRUSTED ACTION="ADD" URI="help" />    </TRUSTED_CONTENT> </HELPCENTERPACKAGE> Once all the changed files have been collected, they should be packaged with CABARC or a similar utility that also includes the package_description.xml file.  Once that CAB file is signed with a registered certificate, it is ready for installation.  By copying the file to the %windir%\pchealth\helpctr\batch folder, the file will be processed upon launch of Help and Support Center.

The Advanced System Information view can be launched from within Help and Support Center or by running  msinfo32.exe  in Run  dialog from the Start menu. The term MSInfo is used in this appendix to refer to the Advanced System Information view. MSInfo is a support tool frequently run by users on their own or by following instructions from a support professional. Some reasons OEMs might want to extend MSInfo: Adding OEM information to MSInfo decreases the amount of time and frustration users spend finding information for a support call OEM information is useful to users when stored in a snapshot (NFO file) or printed from MSInfo An OEM Summary node in MSInfo would let the user print a single page of information, a concise configuration summary for visiting the computer store An OEM could make a baseline system snapshot (NFO file) of the shipped  image   comparing this to a snapshot the user submits would indicate all user modifications to the system MSInfo extensions also work on Server SKUs   the same binary could be used, or a DLL specific to server support needs NFO file snapshots can be generated without user interaction for inclusion in electronic support incidents   great for online support There are MSInfo extensions for Microsoft Office and IE to help reduce support costs for those products, an OEM extension could offer similar benefits MSInfo is frequently run by support professionals at Microsoft, adding OEM information to MSInfo makes it a more valuable tool for OEM helpdesks MSInfo is extended by creating a DLL exposing a specific function and adding a registry entry to tell MSInfo about the extension. If the only information to be displayed is already provided by WMI, this is the only thing which needs to be done. Typically OEMs extending MSInfo will want to create a WMI provider as well, to expose custom information. Information on creating a WMI provider can be found in the Platform SDK or at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp. The WMI provider and the MSInfo extension function can be implemented in the same DLL. Adding a category to MSInfo will also cause the information in that category to be saved in the NFO file (MSInfo s native file format). MSInfo extensions show up in the category tree: Registering the Extension When launching, MSInfo examines the following key in the registry to locate additional extension DLLs to be loaded: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSInfo\templates To have your extension DLL loaded by MSInfo, create a sub-key under this key (use the base name of your DLL as the name of the sub-key), and set the default value of the sub-key to contain the name of the DLL, including the path and extension. For example, you could cause MSInfo to load  defnft.dll  as an extension DLL by creating the following registry entry (REGEDIT4 format): [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSInfo\templates\defnft] @="c:\\defnft\\defnft.dll" Running MSInfo in No UI Mode MSInfo can be used to save an NFO file without displaying a user interface. This is particularly useful when an NFO is being generated for inclusion in an electronic support incident. Generating the NFO can be done in two ways: First, msinfo32.exe can be run with the  /s filename  flag. This causes MSInfo to generate an NFO file named  filename  without ever showing the MSInfo window. Alternatively, a COM interface can be used to programmatically save an NFO file. The following shows the method in IMSInfo: interface IMSInfo : IDispatch // irrelevant methods omitted [id(5), helpstring("method SaveFile")] HRESULT SaveFile(BSTR filename,    BSTR computer,    BSTR category); This interface is located in the msinfo.dll file. The filename works like the parameter in the   flag for msinfo32.exe. The other parameters are described in the help for msinfo32.exe   they can be left blank to save a full NFO for the local computer. DLL Exported Function An extension DLL is any DLL that contains the following exported entry point: DWORD GetTemplate(void ** ppTemplate) MSInfo will call this function when processing the template DLLs. The DLL is responsible for creating the extension template information in a buffer, and setting (*ppTemplate) to point to that buffer. The length of the buffer is returned as a DWORD. When MSInfo is done processing the extension template information, GetTemplate will be called again with a NULL parameter. This is a cue to the template DLL that it can free the buffer containing the extension template information. The DLL must not free the buffer earlier, as MSInfo may still be using it through the pointer returned by the original call to GetTemplate. Extension Template Format Originally, new information could be added to MSInfo through the use of template files. Template files were Unicode text files with   extensions, and contained a textual representation of new categories and information to add to the MSInfo namespace, as well as information for retrieving that data from WMI for display or archiving. Localization requirements for Windows mandated that all localized strings must be part of a resource in a file. This was to allow for use of standard localization tools, and to allow Windows to dynamically load resources from the appropriate locale. Due to these requirements, the MSInfo template information was moved from a text file into an extension DLL. The extension DLL is responsible for reconstructing a buffer of text containing the extension template information in the original NFT format. This can be done using a combination of custom resources for the non-localized information and string resources for the localized info. This section describes the template file format. Remember, even though the format is described in terms of a file, the extension DLL will actually need to construct a text buffer containing the extension information for MSInfo. Template Format Overview The information to be displayed must be available from WMI either in an existing schema or the extender must develop a WMI provider for their information.  The following information is displayed in the template file: Category names for the namespace Column and row labels Class name/data item to be displayed Column widths General Rules The keywords in a template file are not case sensitive. White space (tabs, spaces, etc.) is ignored when the template file is read, as are any lines which start with a pair of forward slashes ( ), allowing the use of comments in the template file.  The template file is made up of a collection of nodes, which create the categories in the MSInfo category tree (the categories show up in the tree view on the left-hand pane). Each node specification contains the column specification (number and header information), and the collection of lines which are to be displayed in the list view pane on the right side of the MSInfo window. File Header The first line of the template file (other than white space or comment lines) must contain a string of the form: MSINFO, ####  signs are replaced by a four digit version number identifying the schema version of the template file. Currently, this number should be  Node Identifier A node is specified in a template file using the   keyword. The following syntax is used: node("static", "InternalNodeName", field("static", "Name"), "No Instance")    ... The first argument in the node construct is reserved, and must be  static . The second argument is the internal name for the node. This name should contain no spaces, and is not displayed to the user (so it will not be localized). The next argument is a field construct that specifies the name of the node as displayed to the user. The first argument to the field construct must be static, the second is the display name of the node (which should be localized). The final argument in the node construct is the message to display if there are no contents when the node is displayed. This string should be localized. Following the node construct is a pair of brackets  . Additional node constructs may be defined recursively within the brackets   these nodes would appear under the root node in the tree view in MSInfo. Column Identifier A column construct can occur once within the brackets following a node construct, and it should appear as the first line (except comments and white space) after the open bracket ( ). The following syntax is used: column(field("static", "DispName [nodename, 150]"), "NONE", "BASIC", ...) The column construct describes one or more columns to be displayed in the MMC results pane. The first argument is the field specifier for the column display name   this works the same way as the field argument in the node construct. The column display name contains the actual text displayed to the user, followed by two values contained in square brackets. The first bracketed piece of information is the name of the node to which this column belongs (this information is included so the localizers can tell where this column header is being used from the disembodied display string, and is not used internally in MSInfo). The second parameter (following a comma) is the width of the column. The best way to set the width is to experiment with the template file in MSInfo, viewing typical data and finding an acceptable default width (the user can change this width). Note: the information in the square brackets is not displayed to the user. The third parameter is the type of sorting to use for this column if the user clicks on the column header. The following values are allowed: Keyword Interpretation Do not allow sorting on this column. LEXICAL Sort using standard lexical (string) sorting. VALUE Sort by the value displayed. This is only valid if the column is displaying numeric or date/time data. This fourth parameter is the classification of the information shown in this column. This should be either  BASIC ADVANCED . Note   in MSInfo on Windows XP all of the information is displayed all of the time. The  BASIC  and  ADVANCED  keywords are ignored. The four parameters are repeated for each column to be specified. No more than 32 columns may be displayed for any node. Line Identifier The line construct is used to specify a line to be displayed on the MSInfo list view. Zero or more line constructs may appear between the brackets following a node construct. (The line construct may also appear in the body of an enumlines construct, described later.) A line is defined by specification of one or more data items (one for each column). The syntax for the line construct is: line("BASIC", field(...), field(...), ...) The first argument should be  BASIC ADVANCED , and controls when the line should be displayed (note   in MSInfo on Windows XP, this value is ignored). The remaining arguments are one or more fields specifying the data to be displayed in each column. The field construct is described below. Field Identifier The field construct is used to specify a piece of information in the template file. The information can either be a static string, or a string built using information queried from WMI. The following syntax should be used in the field construct: field("Class Name", "Format String", WMI field, WMI field, ...) The first argument is either a WMI class name, or the string  static  if this data item is not gathered from WMI. The second argument is a string that controls how the information is displayed to the user. It s a modification of the standard syntax used for printf-style format strings in C. The following format flags are allowed in these strings: Result %x, %X Works like printf to output hexadecimal numbers (additional numeric arguments may be used to control the format of the number). Works like printf to output a decimal number (additional numeric arguments may be used to control the format of the number) Works like printf to output a string. Outputs a boolean value as a localized string (such as  Outputs a date and time (uses an OLE date/time value as an argument). Outputs a string, but converts it to lower case. Outputs a string, but converts it to upper case. The format string is followed by zero or more WMI field names. These must be property names for the class specified in this field construct. The value for each WMI property is retrieved and used when processing the format string. Example Field Constructs field("static", "Verbatim") result: Verbatim field("Win32_OperatingSystem", "%s", Name) sample result: Microsoft Windows NT Server field("Win32_Processor", "%s ~%s Mhz", Manufacturer, ClockSpeed) sample result: GenuineIntel ~166 Mhz field("Win32_CDRomDrive", "%b", Installed) sample result: Yes Enumlines Identifier If a line construct appears inside a node construct, information will be shown for the first instance of a WMI class for each field. For example, if the following appeared in an NFT file: node("static", "SWEnvServices", field("static", "Services"), "None")   columns(field("static", "Display Name [SWSvcs, 150]"), "LEXICAL", "BASIC")           field("static", "Path [SWSvcs, 200]"), "LEXICAL", "ADVANCED")   line("BASIC", field("Win32_Service", "%s", DisplayName),                 field("Win32_Service", "%l", PathName)) This node construct will produce a node that displays two columns. The data will consist of one line   the first instance WBEM finds of the Win32_Service class. To repeat the line construct for each instance of the WBEM class, use the enumlines construct: node("static", "SWEnvServices", field("static", "Services"), "None")   columns(field("static", "Display Name [SWSvcs, 150]"), "LEXICAL", "BASIC")           field("static", "Path [SWSvcs, 200]"), "LEXICAL", "ADVANCED")   enumlines("Win32_Service")     line("BASIC", field("Win32_Service", "%s", DisplayName),                   field("Win32_Service", "%l", PathName)) The single argument to enumlines controls what WMI class is enumerated. In this example, MSInfo will enumerate each instance of the Win32_Service class, and display the line construct for each service found. The output will consist of multiple lines, each one representing a service. More than one line may appear within an enumlines construct. In this case, each of the lines is repeated for each of the instances of the WMI class. You will probably want to divide the groups of lines with a single blank line. For example: node("static", "SWEnvServices", field("static", "Services"), "None")   columns(field("static", "Item [SWSvcs, 150]"), "NONE", "BASIC")           field("static", "Value [SWSvcs, 200]"), "NONE", "BASIC")   enumlines("Win32_Service")     line("BASIC",    field("static", "Display Name"),                      field("Win32_Service", "%s", DisplayName))     line("ADVANCED", field("static", "Service Path"),                      field("Win32_Service", "%l", PathName))     line("BASIC",    field("static", " "), field("static", " ")) Filtering & Joining Extension Sometimes when enumerating a class, you will want to only enumerate instances of the class which meet a certain criteria. For example, you might wish to only list services that are currently running. This would be  filtering  the enumeration. Other times you might want to display data from another class instance that is related to the class you are enumerating. For example, you might be enumerating volumes and want to display information about the physical drive containing the volume. The volume and drive are in different classes, but they are related by a common field. As you enumerate through instances of the volume class, you would like the drive class to enumerate as well. This would be a   between the two classes. The template file format allows you to specify simple conditions on an enumlines construct. This is done by listing fields after the class name in the construct. Fields must be listed in pairs, and the condition for the enumeration is assumed to be that the members of pairs of fields are equal to one another. For example, to filter the services you might do the following: enumlines("Win32_Service", field("Win32_Service", "", State),                             field("static", "Running")) This would enumerate all instances of Win32_Service where the State field equals  Running . Note that in these conditions the format string in the field construct is ignored, as are any additional field names beyond the first one. We can do something along the same lines to join two classes together in the enumeration. To contrive an example, imagine that there is a  Class_Running  class in WMI that contains information about a running service. We want to enumerate the services that are running, and display information about the service from the Running class. To do this, we would use the following: enumlines("Win32_Service", field("Win32_Service", "", State),                             field("static", "Running"),                            field("Win32_Service", "", PathName),                            field("Class_Running", "", PathName)) This would join the two WBEM classes ( Win32_Service  and  Class_Running ) using the PathName field. Finally, some WMI classes work as dependency classes, where each instance represents only the relationship between other classes and contains no other information. These dependency classes have two or more properties, all of which are identifiers for other objects. For example, the WBEM class Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition might contain the following instance: instance of Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition   Antecedent = "\\\\XX\\Root\\Default:Win32_DiskDrive.Index=0";   Dependent = "\\\\XX\\Root\\Default:Win32_DiskPartition.DiskIndex=0,Index=1"; This instance identifies that the machine   has a link between the instance of WMI class Win32_DiskDrive with Index equal to   to the instance of WMI class Win32_DiskPartition which has DiskIndex equal to   and Index equal to  . This particular dependency class is used to relate a drive partition to a physical disk drive. To enumerate a dependency class, use the keyword  dependency  in the first field following the enumerated class in an enumlines structure. For example: enumlines("Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition", field("static", "dependency")) This will enumerate the Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition class, causing each property in the instance of the class to select an instance of another class. So within the lines contained in the enumlines block, you can reference properties from any class referenced by the dependency class. For example: enumlines("Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition", field("static", "dependency"))   line("BASIC", field("static", "Manufacturer"),                 field("Win32_DiskDrive", "%s", Manufacturer))   line("BASIC", field("static", "Description"),                 field("Win32_DiskPartition", "%s", Description))   line("BASIC", field("static", " "), field("static", " ")) Since Win32_DiskDrive and Win32_DiskPartition are contained in properties of Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition ( Antecedent  and  Dependent ), we can use properties of those classes in the lines contained in the enumlines structure.  Template File Hints Design the layout of your information carefully, using nodes within nodes to build a hierarchical tree of information for the user. Each leaf node (a node with no children) will then be used to display information. Typically, a node will either display information from a single instance of a WMI class (for example, the username of the currently logged in user), or it will enumerate instances of a WMI class (for example, displaying information about all of the services). In the latter case, you will use an enumlines construct to enumerate the WMI class. If you are enumerating a class, you have two choices for displaying the information: Column-Oriented. This method uses a column for each data point you want to display, and a single line is output for each instance of the WMI class. Advantages to this method are that sorting can be used on the columns, and the display is compact. This method works will for classes that will have a lot of instances, but it doesn t work very well if there are too many data points (which leads to too many columns). Row-Oriented. This method uses two columns (typically   and  Value ), and a line for each data point of the class. The first column contains the name of the data point, and the second column the value. Usually a blank line will be used at the end of the group of lines to denote that a new WBEM class instance is beginning. This method works will for classes with a lot of data points and not too many instances. It doesn t work well if there will be many instances because this leads to an excess of lines in the display. Also note that sorting doesn t make sense when using this method.

WinPE replaces DOS as a means for booting a computer in order to install operating systems and applications. It contains the minimum functionality needed to run Windows Setup, scripts, or custom applications. With WinPE, you can automate the preinstallation of Windows and applications to your workstations and servers. You can create and format disk partitions, including NTFS file system partitions (with some constraints) and access file shares on your internal network. WinPE supports all mass-storage devices that use Windows 2000 or Windows XP drivers, and additional drivers can be added. WinPE Features WinPE is a minimal Win32 subsystem with limited services, based on the Windows XP Professional kernel running in protected mode. It contains the minimal functionality you need to run Windows Setup, install an operating system from a network share, automate basic processes, and perform hardware validation. The Windows PE CD is a bootable copy of the 32-bit version of WinPE) that supports all mass-storage and networking drivers contained on the Windows XP Professional CD. WinPE includes the following: A hardware-independent Windows environment for both x86 and IA64 architectures, with a small footprint on both the bootable media and in memory.  A subset of the Win32 API, a command-line interface (Cmd.exe) capable of running batch files, and support for standard scripting environments used to create custom tools or scripts.  Network access and support for standard network drivers that may be required for copying images and test suites from a network using TCP/IP. You can add or remove network drivers to customize WinPE.  Support for all mass-storage devices that use Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows .NET Server family drivers. As new devices become available, you can remove unneeded drivers or add additional drivers.  Support to create, delete, format, and manage NTFS partitions.  Hardware diagnostics can be run by loading and testing specific hardware drivers.  Support for the Pre-boot eXecution Environment (PXE) protocol, which can be used to install images from a Remote Installation Server (RIS). If the network card in the computer includes PXE, the card can detect a RIS server and automatically install the WinPE image.  Important To prevent piracy, WinPE reboots automatically after 24 hours of continuous use. Initial Startup WinPE uses the Windows Setup loader instead of the regular boot loader to load Windows. During the initial boot of WinPE, Setup Loader loads the mass-storage device drivers listed in Winpeoem.sif. If no drivers are listed in Winpeoem.sif, Setup Loader loads all of the mass-storage devices present in Windows XP Professional. WinPE will attempt to use the highest screen resolution possible, up to 800x600, 24-bit. While WinPE is starting, press F6 to load a particular device that does not have in-box support and is not listed in Winpeoem.sif. When starting WinPE from a CD, Plug and Play detects the network card installed on the computer, loads the appropriate driver, and binds the network stack. To further reduce the time required to detect the network card, you can customize WinPE to only search for a given set of network drivers, rather than all the network drivers normally present in Windows XP Professional. WinPE loads a standard, single-CPU HAL. Press F5 to load a particular HAL. Win32 Subsystem By default, WinPE uses the Cmd.exe shell. You can customize WinPE to use an alternative shell or application. To do this, edit the  CmdLine  entry in Winpesys.inf to specify your replacement for Cmd.exe. Warning Be careful when editing Winpesys.inf. Even a misplaced comma in it can keep WinPE from booting. When the Win32 subsystem starts, WinPE starts the Cmd.exe shell by using the following entry in Winpesys.inf:  ; startup configuration HKLM,"Setup","CmdLine",,"cmd.exe /k startnet.cmd" Replace "cmd.exe /k startnet.cmd" with the command line for your application. The default Startnet.cmd is as follows: regsvr32 /s netcfgx.dll factory -minint netcfg -v -winpe net start dhcp net start nla a:\floppy.cmd Instead of using the factory -winpe command, this version of Startnet.cmd includes the factory -minint command followed by a netcfg command. This sequence of commands allows for more flexible control over installing and starting network services. Floppy.cmd is a sample file. It can contain any commands normally run at a command prompt. For example, you can launch applications or open additional command windows that run scripts. Floppy.cmd can be omitted if you do not plan to use it. You can customize WinPE to use an alternative shell or application. If Factory.exe does not find a Winbom.ini file, on either the WinPE image or a floppy disk, it stops running. The settings in Winbom.ini provide a wide range of preinstallation tasks. To perform tasks beyond the scope of Winbom.ini, create batch files or scripts to supplement Winbom.ini. With WinPE running, you can use Winbom.ini or your own batch files to do any of the following: Copy a test harness to the destination computer and run hardware diagnostics.  Run programs such as the Diskpart utility to partition and format the drives.  Establish network connectivity with the NET USE command, and change directories to the location of the preinstalled images.  Start the unattended Setup from a network source.  Copy images or install applications from network sources. WinPE stores the registry hives in memory so that applications can write to the registry. Any changes made to the registry by the applications do not persist across different WinPE sessions. Order of Operations in WinPE When you start a computer using WinPE, you are running the command factory -winpe, which processes these sections in Winbom.ini in this order:  [WinPE.Net]  [DiskConfig]  [OEMRunOnce]  [OEMRun]  [WinPE], except for the Restart entry  [UpdateSystem]  The Restart entry in [WinPE]  For more information on Winbom.ini, see Ref.chm in Deploy.cab on the Windows XP CD. Limitations of WinPE To prevent piracy, WinPE automatically exits whatever shell it is running and reboots after 24 hours of continuous use.  A computer running WinPE can make a maximum of 4 network connections.  From a WinPE computer, you can directly access servers and shares across the network, using the required network credentials. However, you cannot access any files or folders located on a WinPE computer from another location on your network.  You cannot access any files or folders located on a DFS share.  The tested methods of gaining network connectivity to file servers are TCP/IP and NetBIOS over TCP/IP. Other methods, such as the SPX/IPX network protocol, are untested and unsupported.  WinPE requires a VGA-compatible device and will attempt to use the highest screen resolution possible, up to 800x600, 24-bit. WinPE is too large to fit on a floppy disk.  Due to anti-piracy concerns, you can only build a customized version of WinPE from the Windows XP Professional CD. You cannot build a custom version of WinPE from Windows XP Home Edition or any member of the Windows .NET Server family.  Windows APIs That Are Not Supported on WinPE To minimize its size, WinPE includes only a subset of the available Win32 APIs, including I/O (disk and network) and core Win32 APIs. If a Win32 API subset is exposed based on a service running on Win32, it may or may not be available on WinPE. The following categories of functions of the Win32 API set are not present in WinPE. For more information on these categories, see the Microsoft Platform SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp). Windows Multimedia  Still Image  OpenGL  NetShow Theater Administration  Bitmap  Brush  Windows Shell  Access Control  Power Options  Printing and Print Spooler  Window Station and Desktop  Terminal Services  User Profile  Tape Backup  Size of WinPE The approximate size of a non-customized version of WinPE is as follows: Platform On-disk image size In-memory size Intel x86 Windows PE Intel IA64 Windows PE ~220 MB ~42MB In-memory sizes are computed when networking services are running. The size of a custom version of WinPE will vary, depending on the set of drivers you choose to include or exclude. The on-disk size of the default WinPE configuration includes all in-box drivers, and many of these drivers are uncompressed. The approximate size of each directory on the 32-bit version of WinPE is as follows: Directory Approximate size \System32 \System32\Drivers \fonts While WinPE is too large to fit on a floppy disk, you can place your customized version of WinPE on many types of bootable media including CD-ROM, DVD, hard disk, or a Remote Installation Services (RIS) Server. If you are using a CD-R or CD-RW, the system you are booting must support booting from CD, as well as the ability to read CD-R or CD-RW media. Reducing the WinPE Footprint By removing non-essential files, the x86 version of WinPE can be reduced to an on-disk image size of 81 megabytes. See Appendix 1: Reducing WinPE for the list of files. Extensions of the Basic Process: Further Customizations of WinPE You may choose to further customize this version of WinPE in one or more of the following ways before copying it to a CD or hard disk. Include a Specific Winbom.ini or Startnet.cmd  You can include a generic Winbom.ini file in a custom WinPE installation that specifies basic information about connecting to your network, formatting the hard disk, and running basic hardware diagnostics. You can include a generic Winbom.ini file in a custom WinPE installation. Factory.exe uses this file if another Winbom.ini is not located on the floppy disk. After using the settings in [WinPE.Net] to establish network connectivity, Factory.exe can use the NewWinbom entry to point to another Winbom.ini file located on the network. You can use the [OEMRun] section in the Winbom.ini file to customize the script that starts. You can also create your own version of Startnet.cmd to run a specific set of commands, batch files, or scripts. To gain access to Windows networking APIs, run the command netcfg -winpe from the WinPE command line. Add or Remove Mass Storage Drivers By default, all network drivers on the Windows XP Professional CD are included in the WinPE image. When you create your own WinPE image, you can add or remove the network drivers or replace the network driver list. By keeping the list to a minimum, you reduce the time required for PnP detection. Customize the Winpeoem.sif file to control which mass-storage drivers are loaded in WinPE. Adding Optional Component Packages to WinPE BuildOptionalComponents.vbs is a script for adding support for optional component packages. It is in the Extras folder on the CD. The packages include Windows Script Host (WSH), HTML Applications (HTA), and ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to allow database connectivity from WinPE to a Microsoft SQL Server.  If you do not specify components, or you do not run this script from the command prompt, all optional components will be installed. If you include HTA, WSH is included automatically, and cannot be removed. The script uses the following several switches: Switch Function Example /S:location Alternate source location other than the XP CD-ROM /S:C:\WindowsXP /D:location Alternate destination other than a folder on the desktop /D:C:\MDAC Build ADO (ActiveX Database Objects) for Microsoft SQL Server connectivity  /HTA  Build HTA (HTML Applications) /WSH  Build WSH (Windows Script Host) Builds and checks WinPE for Itanium;  requires Windows XP for Itanium Runs the script without prompting for inputs; returns any errors Automatically explores the resulting folder when complete Creating a Bootable Version of WinPE on CD or DVD You can modify the included version of WinPE to suit your needs by including any system images, applications, or scripts that you wish to include in your final CD or DVD. With your WinPE image ready, use the OSCDImg command to write the image to CD or DVD. Do not redistribute Etfsboot.com or Oscdimg.exe with your WinPE images. OSCDImg Syntax The OSCDImg command uses the following syntax: OSCDImg  betfsboot.com  n sourceroot destination.iso. Option Action -llabelname Specifies the volume label. No spaces between the l and the labelname.  For example: -lMYLABEL -tmm/dd/yyyy,hh:mm:ss Specifies the time stamp for all files and directories. Do not use any spaces. Use the American date format and a 24-hour clock. May use any delimiter between the items.  For example: -t12/31/2000,15:01:00 Use the Universal Coordinated Time for all files rather than the local time. Include hidden files and directories. Allow long file names. -blocation Specifies the location of the El Torito boot sector file. Do not use any spaces.  For example: -bc:\directory\Etfsboot.bin sourceroot Required. Specifies the location of the WinPE files that you want to build into an .iso image.  image_file Specifies the name of the .iso image file you want to create that contains the WinPE files. To create a bootable WinPE disk Click Start, click Run, and then type cmd.exe.  Change directories to the location containing Etfsboot.com and OSCDImg.exe (included in the Buildtools.zip in the Extras folder). Type OSCDImg  betfsboot.com  n sourceroot destination.iso. Use any non-Microsoft tool that will copy ISO images to CD to create your CDs. To create an ISO-formatted DVD  UDF and UDF/ISO bridge media are not supported in WinPE. Create your ideal WinPE image, which could include an entire Sysprep desktop image of several gigabytes. Complete the same steps above, but include the  m command-line switch. This overrides the block that checks to make sure your ISO image will fit on a CD. You will need to manually check to insure your resulting image will fit on the final DVD recordable media or DVD 5 or 9 (if you are having your media mastered), as OSCDImg will not check for ISO image size above CD standards.  Use any non-Microsoft tool that will copy ISO images to DVD to create your WinPE DVD. Important To configure the WinPE CD so that it boots from the CD every time, if the WinPE CD is present in the CD-ROM drive, remove the \i386\Bootfix.bin file from the WinPE directory structure before you create an .iso file.  Creating an .ISO image of WinPE Another method of creating a bootable WinPE CD is to use Mkimg.cmd to make an ISO image of WinPE and burn it to CD with any third-party CD burning software that support ISO images. Mkimg Command This command builds the file set for the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) from the Windows XP Professional CD, and optionally creates an ISO image of the files. Copy this .iso file to a CD-ROM to create a bootable WinPE CD. Alternatively, you can choose to further customize this version of WinPE. In that case, use Oscdimg to create an .iso file of a 64-bit version of WinPE, and use Dskimage to create a 64-bit CD. The CD image creation process will take several minutes. The files are placed in the same location as Mkimg.cmd. The syntax of the Mkimg command is as follows: Mkimg.cmd source_directory destination_directory [image_name] Option Action source_directory Specifies the location of the CD-ROM for Windows XP Professional or Windows XP 64-Bit Edition. If source_directory is a CD-ROM drive, you only need to specify the drive letter. If source_directory is a network path, the path must be to the parent directory of the \i386 directory. Do not include a trailing slash in source_directory. destination_directory Specifies the path where the files necessary to create the image are temporarily stored. If this directory does not already exist, Mkimg.cmd will create it. image_name Specifies the path and file name of an ISO image file (.iso) that contains your customized version of WinPE. An example Mkimg command is as follows: C:\Build.ia64\Mkimg.cmd E: C:\Winpe.tmp C:\ia64winpe.iso This example creates an ISO image called ia64winpe.iso using C:\Winpe.tmp and the floppy disk as temporary storage areas. Placing a Bootable Version of WinPE on a Hard Disk You can only place a 32-bit version of WinPE on a hard disk. Before you begin, you must format the destination hard disk and install the Recovery Console on this hard disk. To install the Recovery Console Place the Windows XP Professional CD in the CD-ROM drive. You can do this from an existing Windows installation, or by booting new hardware to WinPE on a CD, DVD, or RIS Server. Run cd_drive\i386\winnt32.exe /cmdcons where cd_drive is the drive containing the Windows XP CD.  Now the hard disk is ready for a bootable copy of WinPE. To place WinPE on a hard disk On the destination hard disk, create a C:\Minint directory. You must name the directory Minint.  Use xcopy to copy all of the contents of build_location\i386 to C:\Minint. build_location is the current location of your WinPE build, on a CD, network share, or hard disk. xcopy C:\Build.x86\i386\*.* /S C:\Minint where C:\Build.x86 is build_location. Copy Winbom.ini from build_location to the root of the destination hard disk.  copy C:\Build.x86\Winbom.ini C:\ where C:\Build.X86 is build_location. On the destination hard disk, change the read-only attribute for C:\Cmdcons\txtsetup.sif to read/write.  attrib -r C:\Cmdcons\txtsetup.sif On the destination hard disk, copy C:\Minint\txtsetup.sif to C:\Cmdcons.  xcopy C:\Minint\txtsetup.sif C:\Cmdcons Restart the destination computer. On the Boot menu, select  Command Console. The computer will boot using WinPE.  Placing a Bootable Version of WinPE on a RIS Server Using WinPE on a RIS server requires the following:  A Windows XP product CD and a WinPE CD of the same build number. A properly configured Windows 2000 (SP2) or Windows .NET Server family RIS server. Your destination computers must have a PXE-enabled network interface card (NIC), or have an NIC that is supported by the RIS boot floppy. Windows 2000 or Windows .NET (beta) RIS Server  To install on a Windows 2000 RIS server, deploy the hotfix referenced in KB article Q287546. Contact your technical account manager (TAM) or Product Support Services (PSS) to obtain this hotfix. This hotfix is not required if you are deploying on Windows .NET Server Beta 2 or newer. To create a RIS image and boot from it: On the RIS server, open a command prompt and run RISetup.exe  add.  When prompted for a source, point RISetup to your Windows XP product CD.  Browse to the location where RISetup installed the image, such as:  \\Server_name\Share_name\REMINST\Setup\Language\Images Open the I386 folder in the folder of the image you just created. Browse to the CD or network share containing your WinPE files, and open its I386 folder. Copy the contents of the WinPE I386 folder into the Remote Install I386 folder you just opened, overwriting all files if prompted. Open the Templates folder in the I386 folder you just copied WinPE into. Open the RIStndrd.sif file in a text editor, and on the line that starts with OSLoadOptions, add the switch /minint. Start a RIS client, and select the operating system image you created in Step 1. WinPE starts.

A WALK THROUGH FORMAT
			---------------------
			  Ver.5.00.410Beta
			  ----------------

	Upon entry to Format, the routine Main_Init is called.  This 
performs all the parsing of the command line, and determines the 
default value for DeviceParameters, which represents the highest 
capacity format for the disk drive being used.  Upon return, a copy of 
SwitchMap (a word value which holds all the switches entered on the 
command line) is saved in SwitchCopy.

	The memory block allocated to the Format code is then resized 
using Int 21h function 4Ah, so as to free extra un-needed memory 
allocated for the FORMAT.COM program when it was loaded.

	Module GLBLINIT is responsible for allocating all the buffers 
needed by Format.  These buffers are listed below.


Name			Size				Primary Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------		
DirectorySector		1 sector (512 bytes)	Holds a zeroed 
						sector to be written to 
						disk as the root dir.

FatSpace		FAT+RootDir+		Holds new FAT.  
			7 sectors		Reserves space for 
						buffers needed by 						
						Mirror.

FatSector		1 sector		Read in old FAT 
						one sector at a time.

DirBuf			1 sector		General-purpose use e.g.
						reading in boot sector,
      		 				first sector of root dir.

ClustBound_Buffer_Seg 	1 cluster		Read in bad clusters
						on fixed disks.

mStart			Biggest block of 	Read in system files,
						if needed.


	A buffer for system files will be allocated only if /S is specified.  
If this is present, system files will be read in at this time.  The system 
files are read in now so as to prevent an extra disk swap later, i.e. it is 
assumed that the system disk will be in the default drive at this point.  
In case the buffer was not big enough for all the system files (IO.SYS, 
MSDOS.SYS, COMMAND.COM), they will be read in as much as 
possible.  The remainder will then be read in when the system files 
are being written out to disk, after completion of formatting (This idea
is now prevented: if the files cannot be all read prior to format, format
will fail).

	The 1-cluster buffer will be allocated only if the drive being 
formatted is a fixed disk.

	This module also determines the default value for 
DeviceParameters (by a call to routine GetDeviceParameters, which 
obtains them through Int 21h function 440Dh, subfunction 60h).  These 
default parameters are copied to SavedParams.

	A failure of any function call in GLBLINIT will result in the 
termination of Format.

	The portion after the call to Global_Init is the main loop of the 
program.  The code between 'SysLoop' and 'call More' is repeated for 
each disk to be formatted.

	The routine InitSysParm restores the state of several variables 
so that they are in the original state at the outset for each disk being 
formatted.  Thus DeviceParameters are restored from SavedParams 
and SwitchMap is restored from SwitchCopy.

	All allocated buffers are zeroed out in the routine 
ZeroAllBuffers.

	After prompting the user for the disk to be formatted, disk 
access is ensured through a call to Get_Disk_Access.

	Now module PHASE1 is invoked.  This module primarily 
determines the final value of DeviceParameters to be used in 
formatting the disk.  It also handles all the logical requirements to 
validate a safe format.

	In Phase1Initialisation firstly a media sensing call is made, for 
removable media.  This will utilize new media sensing capabilities of 
the hardware to determine what type of disk is being used.  If this 
function is supported, the BPB field in DeviceParameters will be set to 
that of the media detected.  Media sensing can be supported only on 
3.5in disks.

	The routine Set_BPB_Info is now called to handle the case 
when the disk to be formatted is a non-FAT disk.  This routine will set 
DeviceParameters appropriately in this case. 
Note: This case has not been tested, or ever observed, for that matter.

	The CheckSwitches routine takes action based on the size 
specification switches (/F /N /T /1 /4 /8) entered by the user.  If /F was 
specified, it will be translated into the appropriate value for /N & /T.  
Thus SwitchMap may be modified.  Also, DeviceParameters will be set 
appropriately, for all the formats supported.
Note:  CheckSwitches does NOT modify DeviceParameters if it detects 
that the size specification entered by the user is equal to the default 
size for that drive.  This property is taken into account in determining 
the validity of a safe format in PHASE1.

	Upon return from CheckSwitches, a copy of DeviceParameters 
is saved in SwitchDevParams.

	If the user had specified an unconditional format (/U present), 
the format will be done either according to the entered size 
specification, or else to the default size for the drive (which is its 
maximum capacity).

	If /U is not present, the routine DetermineExistingFormat is 
called.  This routine reads the first 2 sectos and validates the boot
sector (the first sector) on the disk.  If the existing format is found
to be valid, then ResetDeviceParameters is called to copy the BPB read
off the boot sector into that of DeviceParameters.  Further, for removable
media the field DP_CYLINDERS is calculated and set.

	If the disk is not found to have a valid format at this point, 
another routine is called to check in case a disk with a CP/M-type boot 
sector is present (for 160K and 180K disks).  The routine DetermineCPMFormat
validates the first sector of the FAT (the second sector read in 
DetermineExistingFormat) by examining the media descriptor byte.  If this is
found to be a CP/M media descriptor, DeviceParameters will be modified.  
A table of customized BPBs is used for this purpose.  <In short, this is 
an extensive routine which will almost always have to be called, while 
being applicable only in obsolete cases.>

	If the disk if found NOT to have a valid format, a check is made 
to see if there was an error reading the disk due to an open door, etc.  
If so, a message will be given and Format will be terminated.  
Otherwise SwitchMap is checked to see if /Q was specified.  Since 
there is no valid existing format, Quick format cannot be done, so a 
warning message will be issued, and the user will be prompted 
whether or not to continue with an unconditional format.  If the user 
chooses to continue, /Q will be turned off, and /U will be turned on.  

	There is one exception to this logic: the user is allowed to 
enter /Q together with a size specification, which means "Quick format 
all pre-formatted disks with their original format, but format new disks 
with the specified size".  Thus, if /Q is present, SwitchMap is checked 
for (/F, /N or /T) and if these are present, the warning message is not 
given.  Instead, the message is jumped over, and the program 
continues as if the user had entered "Yes" to the continue prompt.  
The code will now continue, with DeviceParameters finalized, at 
DevParamsOk.

	In case the disk is found to have a valid existing format, then 
the values of SwitchDevParams and DeviceParameters are compared 
for equality.  If found to be equal, execution continues at 
DevParamsOk (i.e. there is no conflict between any user-specified 
size and the existing format on disk).  Otherwise a warning message
will be issued since there is a conflict between the entered size or
default size andthe format on disk, and the user will be asked 
whether to proceed with an unconditional format.  If the user chooses 
to continue, /U will be turned on and SwitchDevParams will be copied 
into DeviceParameters, so as to utilize the size specification given by 
the user.

	The only exception to the last case is when /Q is present 
together with a size specification, as explained above. Then a safe 
format will be done using the current disk format.

	After having finalized DeviceParameters, the track layout in 
DeviceParameters is initialized, in the loop LoadSectorTable.  Some 
other initialisation is performed here also, such as determining the 
starting sector, and whether we have a 12 or 16-bit FAT.  The total 
number of clusters is also computed.

	After PHASE1, the MIR_MAIN module will be invoked to create 
the recovery file in case /U has not been turned on.  In order to 
accomodate any buffer space needed by the Mirror utility, it is 
necessary to release the space used by the FatSpace buffer.  This 
buffer is originally made big enough to accomodate all the buffer 
requirements of Mirror (this is FAT + Root Dir + Boot Sector + 6 extra 
sectors + 1 surplus sector to allow for arena headers).  The FatSpace 
buffer is re-allocated upon successful return from Mirror.  In case the 
creation of the recovery file failed, the user will be given the option of 
continuing with an unconditional format.

	Phase2Initialisation performs some calculations relating to the 
format to be performed.

	The routine ShowFormatSize is now called to display the size 
of the format to be done.

	Finally, the actual disk formatting is done in module 
DSKFRMT.  The FatSpace buffer is initialised and loaded with the 
media descriptor byte at the start.  The drive parameters are set to 
those of the intended format through a call to SetDeviceParameters, 
using the DeviceParameters parameter block.  For a Quick format, the 
routine QuickFormat is called.  This pseudo-formats the disk by 
copying all bad cluster markers from the old FAT into the new FAT.  
The old FAT is traversed sequentially, and is read in 1 sector at a 
time, into FatSector.

	In the case of a regular format, SwitchMap is first checked to 
see if /U is present.  If it is, the 'Format and Verify Track' operation will 
be performed on each track.  Otherwise only 'Verify Track' will be 
performed.

	The routine Write_Disk_Info writes out the new boot sector, 
root directory and FAT, as well as the system files, if requested.  Great 
care is taken not to over-write any old files if a system transfer is 
being done together with a safe format.  There are four cases which 
must be addressed here.  These are as follows.

		[1]	Unconditional format without system files
		[2]	Unconditional format with system files
		[3]	Safe format without system files
		[4]	Safe format with system files

	Cases [1], [2] and [3] are all handled the same way.  This is as 
follows.  The boot sector is written out, followed by a zeroed root 
directory, and the new FAT (which is zero except for bad cluster 
markers).  If needed, the system files can now be written out.

	Case [4] is handled in a special way, as described below.  The 
boot sector and a zeroed root directory is written out.  The disk is now 
checked to see if there is enough space for the system files.  At this 
point the old FAT on the disk is still there, so the free space cannot 
overlap any allocated clusters.

	If there is insufficient space, the user will be given a warning 
message and prompted whether to perform a system transfer which 
will prevent later recovery, or just not to transfer the system files.  If 
the user chooses to continue with the transfer, then the old FAT will 
first be over-written with the new FAT, and then system files will be 
written out.  If the user chooses not to continue, the new FAT will be 
written out, and system files will not be transferred.

	If there is sufficient space, then it is necessary to ensure that 
IO.SYS (the first system file) is written out to a location on disk so that 
it is contiguous.  This is achieved by calculating the number of 
clusters needed to accomodate a size of 1.5Kbytes (the maximum 
size of IO.SYS).  This value will be between 1 and 3.  The old FAT will 
then be scanned to find a free cluster block of this size, and disk 
allocation will be forced to start from there, using an undocumented 
DPB function.  In case such a cluster block cannot be found (extremely 
unlikely), the user will be given a warning that system transfer will 
destroy disk files and the program will proceed as described above.  
Once the cluster block is found, the system files are now written out to 
disk.  Since the old FAT is still on disk, this method obviates the 
possibility of over-writing old disk files.  After transfer is complete, the 
FAT chains for the three system files will be copied from the old FAT 
into the new FAT.  Note that the root directory entries will automatically 
appear in the new root directory as the system files are written out.  
The new FAT will then be written out to disk, over the old FAT.

	The routine More prompts the user whether another disk is to 
be formatted.  If the user chooses to format another disk, execution 
will resume at SysLoop, where the original state of parameters will be 
restored.

SAFEFORMAT

=======================================================================

The following new source files have been added to the format
directory.

      SAFE.ASM    - Additional program source code
      SAFE.INC    - Extrn definitions to be included in other modules
      SAFEDEF.INC - Structure and equates used in SAFE.ASM
      NEWFMT.DOC  - This information and specification file


All changes to the existing format program have been incorporated
within conditionals. The defined value SAFE will determine whether
the new safe format is built. The build the safe format add the
command line switch for the assembler "-DSAFE=1". To disable
creation of the safe format and build the normal format program
change the switch to -DSAFE=0.

=======================================================================

The design specification for the MS-DOS 4.x safe format and unformat
utility is based on the these underlying assumptions.


FORMAT assumptions:

  1.  The utility is version dependent and will alway fail to run
      under versions of DOS (as reported by DOS function 30h)
      other the version it was designed for.

  2.  The utility will only attempt to preserve and restore existing
      DOS 4.x compatible parititions.

  3.  The utililty will incorporate general safty features but will
      rely on the integrety of the underlying operating system for
      detecting error conditions while accessing the hard disk.

  4.  There will be no attempt to allow restoration of a partition
      which was recognized as being damaged before the format
      operation had begun.

  5.  If for any reason the restoration files cannot be created
      the user will notified and allowed to decide if the format
      should continue without the restoration ability. There is
      one exception to this assumption and that is the case where
      a partition is detected to be unformated as described later.

  6.  The default operation during format will be to create the
      restoration file. A command line switch will allow the user
      to disable the feature.

  7.  All disk access will be done via DOS file handles and interrupts
      25h and 26h to allow DOS to detect and return any error
      conditions.

  8.  Only the first copy of the FAT will be saved. If any sectors
      in the first copy of the FAT cannot be successfully read
      using int 25h, an attempt will be made to read the corresponding
      sectors from the second copy of the FAT. Only if the
      corresponding sectors in both copies of the FAT cannot be read
      will it be assumed the the FAT is bad and a restoration file
      cannot be created.

  9.  The restoration file must contain all information neccessary
      to allow the restoration program to restore the original
      partition immediately after a format. If the original partition
      was a boot partition it must be restored so that it will boot
      the original operating system which was present before the
      format operation.

  10. The system files will consist of the either of the following
      2 groups of files plus COMMAND.COM.
      (IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS) or (IBMBIO.SYS and IBMDOS.SYS)

  11. It will be assumed that a partition has never been formatted
      if the boot record is not valid using the conditions that the
      last 2 bytes of a boot sector contain a boot signature and
      the first byte is near or short jump opcode. When a partition
      has never been formatted a restoration file will not be
      created. There will be no need to alert the user to this action
      and formating will proceed as it does with the existing DOS 4.x
      utility.

  12. The restoration file will be created in the root directory
      before formating begins and this directory entry will be
      restored to the root directory as the 4th entry in the new
      root directory with an E5h placed in the first byte of the
      first 3 directory entries to allow room for operating system
      files. The restoration file will use the name "UNFORMAT.DAT"
      and will be created with HIDDEN, SYSTEM and READONLY
      attributes set.

  13. Any previous restoration file will be deleted at the time
      a new restoration file is created.

      WARNING: This will mean that if a user reformats a hard
      disk immediately after a previous format, the original
      contents of the hard disk will be lost.

  14. The restoration file will be designed so that it can allow
      restoration of the hard disk reguardless of the condition of
      boot sector, FAT or root directory after completion of the
      format operation. This feature is only for possible future
      enhancements and in this implementation there will be no
      attempt to restore a hard disk if the restoration file
      cannot be successfully read from the disk using the normal
      DOS file and sector read and write operations.

  15. The FAT which is written to the restoration file will also
      contain the FAT allocation chain for the restoration file.

  16. The DOS control C check will be disabled while the system areas
      of the disk are being written to help minimize the chance of
      losing the restoration file's directory entry and FAT chain.

      NOTE:
      The user will still be allowed to CTRL C out of the format at
      any time previous to this without damaging the integrity of
      the existing partition other than the deletion of any
      previously existing restoration file. 

  17. There will be 2 checksums in the restoration file header. One
      will be a checksum of the sector containing the file header
      and the other will be a checksum of the entire restoration
      file. The file header checksum will be used to confirm the
      file header is the valid starting sector of a restoration
      file and the file checksum will be used to insure the
      integrety of entire restoration file before a restoration
      is done.

  18. The information contained in the restoration file is intended
      to only allow the restoration of a hard disk partition if the
      UNFORMAT utility is used before any new files are written to
      the partition after a format operation. If any new files are
      written the partition is formatted it will void the integrety
      of the original FAT and the partition will be corrupt.

  19. The FORMAT utility must allow restoration of the original
      partition even in the event that the /S option is used to
      install a new operating system on the partition. This will
      be accomplished by assuring that the new OS does not
      overwrite any existing allocated areas other than the first
      2 clusters of the disk which have been saved in the restoration
      file.

  20. The fatal disk error handler will be changed so that IGNORE is
      not an option for handling of fatal disk errors. Only RETRY,
      FAIL and ABORT will be valid options.

The Write Filter driver filters and re-routes disk I/O to memory or another storage medium thus providing the illusion of a single read/write storage device. Target Designer Procedure After opening Target Designer on the host development platform, you create a new configuration file and save it, using an appropriate file name for the target embedded device. Use the component browser to view the available components. Then use the component browser to select and configure the components for the target embedded run-time image. After selecting the necessary components, build an embedded run-time image, and move the embedded run-time image to the target embedded device. Using Target Designer, an embedded systems developer must perform the following operations:  Create a new configuration file (.slx).  Save a configuration file (.slx).  Select components for the target configuration.  Generate (build) an embedded run-time image.  Deploy the embedded run-time image on the target embedded device.  The run-time image can be transferred from the host system to the target system using traditional media such as diskette, (bootable) CDROM, and DVD or can be transferred by swapping a storage device such as hard-disk drive or non-volatile/persistent storage module (ROM, Flash-based technology). gd);2 gd);2 gd);2

The Mantis framework is quite flexible.  It is certainly more powerful a tool than the embedded team itself needs, given what features are used in the current componentization of Windows XP.   Mantis is desingned to operate in an OEM s production environment, where dependence on a large database and network connectivity are not liabilities. Truly, in Mantis the component metadata is sometimes larger than the component itself.   In some ways this question is easier to answer from the negative   that is, what does Setup team need Mantis to do that it cannot?  (I ll try to concentrate on the Mantis object model and the CMI, not the existing componentization of Windows XP.) From Setup s perspective the Mantis  repository  has some problems.   It continues the practice of throwing everything in one directory, and maintaining metadata (the component definitions) separately. Components are defined in the database only. Over the last several versions of Mantis, repositories and the configurations made from them have broken upon upgrade.  Since the repository and versioning system are (purportedly) designed to prevent this sort of problem, I can only assume the Mantis team has not had great success, or it has been quite difficult, to use the Mantis versioning system for what it was intended. Mantis is designed as a build process, not a live maintenance tool. Ideally, one should be able to not just install but maintain Windows and applications using componentized setup. Mantis has no concept of state after an image has been built and thus no concept of uninstall.  One should be able to extend Mantis to cover these situations by adding to the platform script, but  What might we look for in a more integrated componentization scheme for Windows? One thing to consider is how a developer will componentize his code, be it a driver or a library or what have you. This should be part of the normal code-and-build cycle: compiling your DLL or driver should build its component. Mantis grouping is particularly loose, guaranteeing nothing about a component but that its author added it to the group.  It would be nice if the grouping system validated components as well.  For instance, all components in the drivers group must have a hardware/plug-and-play ID.  Once a component is built, it should last forever   building a component should produce a single file (like a CAB file) which contains everything you need to use the component: metadata, files, registry data, et al. Components and groups should be divisible.  Take MFC today. One hopes that in the future MFC will be broken down into base MFC support and advanced classes for its internet capabilities.  A component which depended on the old MFC component or interface should seamlessly depend on the several parts of the new MFC. While Mantis provides for this in a way (with End-of-Life components) it is unquestionably awkward.   EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   m going to go ahead and give a little proposal.  I think componentization is important.  I believe it should be a basic part of the development process.  I think it should be validated at compile-time. Most importantly, the semantics and structure of components closely matches that of object-oriented programming itself.  Why not take advantage of that fact, and let developers define components using a programming language?  Almost everything in Mantis is actually done by VBScript.  Why the glaze? public class MyMouseDriverComponentDefinition extends ComponentDefinition implements USBMouseDriverComponent, PicoSoftComponent { public Dependency[] getDependencies() { return new Dependency[] { new Dependency( Pros: Flexible.  Script-based build process allows framework to be adapted to many situations. Cons: Script-based build process means little functionality is actually built into the framework.

Otherwise, the source directory is rejected. %WINPESRCDIR% is set based on the architecture.  The build directory (%WINPEOPTDIR%) is set to the current directory (%CD%) and validated: The existence of extra.inf is checked for. If the architecture is x86, the existence of oemmint.exe and bldhives.exe is checked for. The current directory is changed to the build directory (%WINPEOPTDIR%). Since %WINPEOPTDIR% was set to the current directory, this is a no-op. oemmint.exe verifies that the source directory (%WINPESRCDIR%) is the correct version of Windows XP. setupreg.hiv is copied from the source directory into the build directory. This file only exists in IA64, thus with the x86 target architecture this is a no-op.   All registry hive INF files (hive*.inf) are copied from the source directory into the build directory. When targeting x86 this is a no-op.  The following files are copied when targeting IA64: hivecls.inf, hivedef.inf, hivesft.inf, hivesys.inf, and hiveusd.inf. bldhives.exe builds the binary hives, being passed config.inf on its command line.  The contents of the image (destination) directory (%WINPEDESTDIR%) are silently deleted.  The directory corresponding to the target architecture (.\i386 or .\ia64) is created in the image directory. The tag files (win51.rc1 and win51mp.rc1) are copied from the source directory into the image directory. oemmint.exe copies the subset of Windows XP needed by WinPE, as well as extra WinPE-specific files from the build directory, and files specified in extra.inf. The Side-by-Side directory from the currently running OS (%WINDIR%\WinSxS) is copied into the image directory as %WINPEDESTDIR%\%PLATEXT%\WinSxS. The platform-specific winbom.ini file (%WINPEDESTDIR%\%PLATEXT%\winbom.ini) is copied from within the image directory into the root of the image directory. The WinPE CD image is created if requested on the command line If the target architecture is x86,  -betfsboot.com  is appended to %CDIMG_OPTS%. If the target architecture is IA64, a boor image is created using a floppy disk.  setupldr.efi is copied to a floppy disk dskimage.exe is used to create a disk image of A: as efisys.bin in the current directory (which is still the build directory). -befisys.bin  is appended to %CDIMG_OPTS%. oscdimg.exe creates the command-line-specified ISO image file (%IMAGENAME%) from the image directory (%WINPEDESTDIR%). Pros and cons of the current build process Pros: OEMs can produce their own bootable WinPE versions at will working off XP Pro CD Cons: Changing which parts of XP to include in WinPE involves changing the widely-depended upon layout.inf file. Setting up the system to boot WinPE, especially off the HD, requires somewhat complex interaction with IA64 boot process, one which the XP installer makes that much more obscure (by skipping the boot menu after install/upgrade). Pros and Cons of using Mantis to build WinPE Pros: GUI configuration tool exists. Much thought/design/testing has gone into their componentization model. Resource types are very flexible   can define new types of resources as needed Cons: Currently no support for IA64, main use case of WinPE.  Moreover, NTE group had no use case for Mantis on IA64, so is unlikely to perform componentization of XP/IA64. Intended for situations where exact hardware configuration is known at image creation time   exactly the opposite of most WinPE use-cases. Read-only-media boot still under development by Mantis team Desire to include all network interface and mass storage drivers runs contrary to component definitions   should be able to use post-processing to get around. The current WinPE build process metadata The current process is based on the standard XP configuration file layout.inf.  Two fields were added to the key values to specify WinPE source and destination directories.  The files that make up WinPE are a subset of files which appear in the Windows XP Professional SKU, plus some WinPE-specific binaries.  The WinPE specific binaries are obtained from the build directory and are specified by the file extra.inf.  Current WinPE build process experience Here are the steps I followed to build a default WinPE image for x86. Unless specified otherwise, each step is adapted from the directions in the OPK User s Guide: Obtain a base Windows XP Professional Setup CD image from which the Windows PE will be built. One can use an install CD; I copied the contents of   HYPERLINK "\\\\winbuilds\\release\\main\\usa\\2496\\x86fre\\pro"  \\winbuilds\release\main\usa\2496\x86fre\pro  to a local directory,   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\d$\\images\\2496-x86fre-pro"  D:\images\2496-x86fre-pro . I also shared this directory (as   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\pro"  \\t-jpol-dev\pro ) to t-jpol-dev\Guest, granting RLX privileges as well. Copy some WinPE-specific binaries from the OPK CD into the build location. I copied the contents of   HYPERLINK "\\\\robsvbl1\\latest\\opk\\winpe"  \\robsvbl1\latest\opk\winpe  to my local build directory, D:\images\winpe-build. Copy the factory.exe and netcfg.exe tools into the build location. I copied them from   HYPERLINK "\\\\robsvbl1\\latest\\opk\\tools\\x86"  \\robsvbl1\latest\opk\tools\x86  to my local build directory, D:\images\winpe-build. I made a copy of the winpe-build directory at this point to save myself the above two steps in the future.  Run mkimg.cmd.  I ran the command mkimg D:\images\2496-x86fre-pro D:\images\winpe-build-dest. 1040 files were copied. I shared the winpw-build-dest directory (as   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\winpe"  \\t-jpol-dev\winpe ) so I could access it from my test machine. Since I am going to be running WinPE off my test machine s HD, I followed these steps, again adapting from the OPK guide. On my test machine, I booted off an existing WinPE CD. I ran net use P:   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\pro"  \\t-jpol-dev\pro  to mount the Windows XP Professional installation CD image I d copied into   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\d$\\images\\2496-x86fre-pro"  D:\images\2496-x86fre-pro I ran P:\i386\winnt32 /cmdcons to install the Recovery Console. I ran net use Q:   HYPERLINK "\\\\t-jpol-dev\\winpe"  \\t-jpol-dev\winpe  to mount the WinPE directory D:\images\winpe-build-dest. I ran mkdir C:\MININT. I copied the contents of Q:\I386 into C:\MININT with the command xcopy Q:\I386\*.* /S C:\MININT. 1037 files were copied. copy Q:\winbom.ini C:\ attrib -r C:\cmdcons\txtsetup.sif copy C:\MININT\txtsetup.sif C:\cmdcons I modified C:\boot.ini: [boot loader] timeout=30 default=c:\cmdcons\bootsect.dat [operating systems] c:\cmdcons\bootsect.dat="Microsoft Windows XP Preinstall Environment" /cmdcons c:\="Microsoft Windows 98 SE" Reboot the destination (test) machine. To make an image for ia64, I copied the tools from \\robsvbl3 (instead of \\robsvbl1) into a copy of my backup winpe directory.  Then, I ran the command  mkimg \\winbuilds\release\main\usa\2496\ia64fre\pro D:\images\winpe-2496-ia64. This single error is reported:  Error in copying (2) : \\winbuilds\release\main\usa\2496\ia64fre\pro\ia64\efinvr.exe -> D:\images\winpe-build-ia64\IA64\system32\efinvr.exe . There is a bug in the OPK documentation; the file efinvr.exe must also be copied from the tools directory in the 3rd step above when making an image for IA64. Once the IA64 image was ready, I copied the contents of D:\images\winpe-2496-ia64\IA64 into C:\MININT on the IA64 machine.  HYPERLINK "\\\\robsvbl3\\latest\\idw\\dosdev.exe"  \\robsvbl3\latest\idw\dosdev.exe  -s v: mkdir v:\minint copy C:\minint\setupldr.efi V:\minint\ c:\minint\system32\efinvr.exe /add v:\minint\setupldr.efi c:\minint reboot At this point, setupldr.efi reported that txtsetup.sif is missing, and could not continue. copy C:\minint\txtsetup.sif V:\minint\ reboot At this point, setupldr.efi reported that \MININT\system32\ntkrnlmp.exe could not be found.  I realize I should rename the v:\MININT directory to distinguish it from the one on C:.  I rename it to v:\peboot. Also, I remembered the  WINNT32  boot option. c:\minint\system32\efinvr.exe /delete 1 c:\minint\system32\efinvr.exe /add v:\peboot\setupldr.efi c:\minint /options  WINNT32 reboot WinPE now boots properly on IA64.  Unfortunately, as I discovered, the command console does not create BOOTSECT.DOS, so the old Win98 installation is not bootable.

1. Disable realtime AV monitor, if present.  It contains several bugs
   which will interfere with the rapidly-changing filesystem.

2. xcopy each CD variation to
   \xppatch\forest\<locale>\<processor>\history\2600\<variation>
   The locale name is one from the first column in language.lst.
   Processor is one of:
        i386
        ia64
   The actual names used for <variation> are not important.
   I chose to use "per", "pro", etc.

3. Add all the symbols corresponding to these CDs, using
   <variation> names of "symbols" or "symbols.pri", ie "2600\symbols".
   CURRENTLY, the XP symbols format is hosing MPATCHES, so
   the symbols directory needs to be flattened out:
       cd symbols
       for /d %f in (*) do (move %f\* . /y & rd %f)

4. expand all the compressed ("xxx_") files in place:
       set path=\xppatch\bldtools;%path%
   for each variation:
       cd \xppatch\forest\en\<processor>\history\2600\<variation>
       for /d /r %d in (*) do attrib -r -h -s %d
       attrib -h -r -s * /s
       for /r %f in (*_) do call flat.bat %~pf %~nxf
       attrib -h -r -s * /s

5. crack all the CAB files.
       set path=\xppatch\bldtools;%path%
       cd \xppatch\forest\en\<processor>\history\2600
       for /f %f in ('dir *.cab /s /b /a /one') do (pushd %~dpf && crackcab %f && popd)

6. Lowercase (for consistency) and create a manifest file for the tree:
       cd \xppatch\forest\en\<processor>\history\2600
       tolower . /s
       makefest . /s

For today, this is leaving behind:
   - a small number of Java class ZIP files
   - several WMZ (ZIP) files
   - several self-extracting EXEs
   - several MSIs
   - private symbols
   - symbols with duplicate base names

Figure 5: Component Instance Script  PAGEREF _Toc480977544 \h  Introduction Mantis is both an architecture and a product. The Mantis architecture defines a generic component database and the tools and interfaces that manipulate that database, while the Mantis product is Windows Embedded (and future versions thereof). This dual aspect is a result of the requirements of the project: To define the schema and generate the metadata required to describe Windows 2000 (and future releases) as a set of discrete components. To create and ship the Windows Embedded product. To create tools that will work unchanged with future versions of the Embedded product. The first two requirements are in fact closely related, since the Windows Embedded product relies upon the Mantis architecture for most of its functionality. The final requirement has resulted in the creation of a generic architecture that is decoupled from the specific needs of the Windows Embedded product. Related Documents The Windows Embedded web site contains a complete glossary of terms used throughout the Mantis project. See http://nte/general/glossary.asp for more information. Specializations of the Mantis architecture for particular platforms and projects are not specified in this document. For individual platform details, consult the appropriate Platform Specialization document. These documents describe details such as special extended properties, resource types, and script implementation details that are specific to a particular platform or group of platforms. Requirements This is not a requirements document. However, the requirements summary below will help in understanding the rationale behind the Mantis architecture. Mantis requirements include: Scalability The component database must scale from a small stand-alone system, perhaps running on a laptop, to an enterprise system. The system should support in excess of 100,000 components without serious performance degradation. Extensibility New components may be added to the database at any time, both by Microsoft and 3rd parties (OEMs). Multiple Platforms A single Mantis database must support multiple platforms with variations such as different operating systems, CPU types, different locales, free or checked builds of individual components, and multiple co-existing discrete versions of individual components. Predictability Building a configuration from the database should result in a consistent run-time image, regardless of additions to the database such as new components or new versions of components. Tool Neutrality The core functionality of the architecture must be de-coupled from the presentation of features via the UI tools. Scriptable For large installations the ability to automate all operations is essential. Platform Neutral Architecture The architecture must be de-coupled from the specifics of individual OS requirements. The Windows Embedded Product Windows Embedded is a "componentized" version of the Windows 2000 operating system. The componentization process dissects the retail OS into a series of distinct components each of which describes an atomic unit of functionality. A subset of these components is then combined in a build process to generate a run-time image. This compact image contains only the functionality implied by the included components, and is typically much smaller (in terms of both storage and execution footprint) than the full retail Windows 2000 product. The reduced footprint is critical to the success of the Windows Embedded product. Table 1 shows some example footprints that apply to Windows NT Embedded 4.0, the previous Embedded product. Table 1: Example Windows NT Embedded 4.0 Footprints Application Features Storage Stand-alone Device w/o Network Minimal OS + Command Console 12 MB LAN Router Minimal OS + Network + Routing and RAS 16 MB 25 MB Server Appliance Minimal OS + Network + IIS + PDC + DHCP + WMI 32 MB 40 MB As table 1 shows, the footprint of the Embedded product is far below that achievable with the retail product. This reduced footprint allows NT technology to be deployed in the various new product categories that are emerging in the "PC Plus" era, such as set-top boxes and information appliances. These devices are typically fixed-function devices with lower COGS and are therefore much more sensitive to BOM issues than the traditional PC architecture. The Windows Embedded product thus consists of a database that describes the individual components, the standard retail product binaries, and tools that allow the user to define a subset of these components (a configuration) that are then combined into the final run-time image. The Mantis Architecture The Mantis component architecture provides a generalized framework for the management of components and configurations and the generation of run-time images. However, by making the framework generic and decoupling OS specific requirements from the architecture, the entire system can be adapted to other uses for other platforms. To realize the generation of the run-time image, the Mantis environment contains the following core modules (shown in Figure 1): One or more User Interface Tools that interact with the other modules to manage configurations and build run-time images. A Configuration Management Interface (CMI) that provides a COM based interface between the user interface tools and the other Mantis modules. A Component Database that contains metadata describing all of the components available for inclusion in a run-time image. One or more Repositories that contain the files that comprise the various components. Files from the repositories are copied to the run-time image during the build process. A Configuration that describes (among other things) which components are to be included in the run-time image, and how these components are to be configured. Figure 1 below shows the relationship between these modules.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 1: Mantis Modules Component Database Clients Potential clients for the Mantis architecture include: Windows Embedded This is the obvious client for the Mantis architecture. The Windows Embedded product will consist of a populated database and repository along with tools (Target Designer and Component Designer) to configure and build run-time images. Derived Products The Windows Embedded product is essentially a horizontal platform. It will be possible to derive additional products from this platform aimed at vertical markets, such as appliances, set-top boxes etc.  Windows 2000 Setup In the future, Windows 2000 retail Setup can become a front-end for the Mantis architecture and construct the users installation by choosing components and then initiating a build. Service Packs and QFE/SE The Mantis architecture defines a robust versioning mechanism that offers the ease of use of slipstream approaches to SPs with the robustness and backward compatibility of discrete SP shipments. Self-healing strategies within Windows 2000 Existing technologies such as SFP can leverage the database to extend their functionality from a simple "file copy" to performing a full component-level recovery. Additional Windows 2000 derivatives, subsets, and supersets. Database Population Population of the database with components is beyond the scope of this document. However, some possible sources of component metadata are: INF files and MSI files DLL static dependencies Fixed (always present) functionality (i.e. core components) Windows 2000 build tree DIRS and SOURCES files Windows 2000 project files Windows 2000 Setup Windows NT Embedded 4.0 component database Path name references in Windows 2000 source tree GUID references in Windows 2000 source tree Building 26 developers brains INX and other information maintained by the NT build lab Other parts of the Mantis project will define tools that automate the extraction of metadata from the sources noted above. Architectural Overview TODO: Rework to match rest of document (last) The CMI provides the sole interface between the various Mantis elements and the users of Mantis (i.e. the user interface tools such as Target Designer). The interface is exposed as a series of COM Automation objects that map onto the core features of the architecture (components, packages etc.). Some of the core logic behind these objects is wired into the CMI, however most of the key functions associated with a configuration are implemented as script that is part of the configuration. This provides inherent flexibility and extensibility without the need to rebuild or alter the CMI. Typically, however, script is not required to implement basic features and functionality (for example, when defining component metadata). This reduces the learning curve associated with creating data for Mantis. The extensive use of script within a configuration provides great flexibility in the Mantis architecture. For example, the architecture defines the concept of a "build" operation that is invoked through the Config.Build method. However, the actual processing of the build operation is handled entirely by script defined by the platform. Therefore, each platform can totally redefine the semantics associated with a "build" operation. Carriers The component database is populated with data by an import process. Once imported, data in the database is not editable the entire component database is essentially read-only. Thus the database is actually more like a "data warehouse", since the data contained within it is essentially static. The import process imports component database data from XML files. These files contain the definitions of all the object types within the database, including platforms, groups, resources, and components. There is no significance to the placement of information in a carrier file a single carrier file may contain (for example) an entire set of components and files. Alternatively this same information may be arbitrarily split across multiple carrier files. Carrier XML files have a file type (extension) of .SLD. After a carrier file is imported the file is no longer required. However, any files referenced by Resource objects within the carrier file are not copied into the database, and are referenced in-place during the build process. These files are stored in a location known as a repository. Repositories A repository is an archive that is used as a source of binary files during the construction of the run-time image. All the files that comprise the run-time, with the exception of the registry hives and any other files constructed on the fly, originate in one or more repositories. Each repository may comprise either a single folder that contains the repository files, or a CAB file containing the files. The CAB file is the preferred method of repository distribution, but Mantis also supports direct access to files in a folder so that pre-existing folders may be used as-is. Note that each repository is a single folder, not a complete folder tree. Repositories are described as entries in a carrier file. Before a repository can be used as the source of files the carrier file describing the repository must be imported into the database. Repositories also play a special role in the selection of "free" and "checked" (debug) builds of the run-time image. Each repository is marked as either a "free" repository or a "checked" repository. When a configuration is built either the free or checked build can be constructed, and the appropriate files are automatically selected from the correct repository. When a carrier is imported into the database, the repository files can be referenced "in place" (which might happen if the repository came from a CDROM or a network share) or can be copied to another location (more typical for service packs or 3rd party components). Regardless of which option is chosen, the repository retains its identity within the component database: repositories are never "merged" during an import process. Repositories may be deleted from the component database. Components Components within the database define discrete packets of functionality that can be included in the final run-time image. The functionality defined by a component is expressed as a set of resources, properties and optional script. Even if script is not present, the component prototype mechanism (described below) supplies default script to implement the component functionality. Typically, the functionality of a component is defined as a series of files that can be copied from one or more repositories to the run-time image and a set of registry keys/values that must be added or edited. The functionality defined by an individual component can vary widely. A simple component (such as one that enables automatic logon) might simply set one or more registry keys. Other components might define device drivers, services, or complete applications. To ensure that a component has all the required resources to run correctly, the component can specify a set of dependencies. These dependencies specify which other components are needed, or which other components conflict with the current component.  There are three types of dependencies: "include", "build" and "registry". Include dependencies cause the automatic addition or exclusion of components as necessary during configuration. Build dependencies control the order in which components are built during the build process, but they do not cause the automatic inclusion of components. Registry dependencies also control the build order, but they are generated automatically by the CMI as the result of an analysis of component registry inter-dependencies. Dependencies may be specified directly between components (X depends on Y) or indirectly through the use of dependency groups. Each component can belong to zero or more dependency groups. For example, all NIC drivers might belong to a "NICDriver" group. Dependencies are then specified indirectly (X depends on group G, Y is a member of G). The dependency mechanism is flexible and can specify constructs such as "at least one of" and "only one of". Thus it is possible to specify dependencies such as  X depends on at least one of group G . Note that one possible dependency is  , which is interpreted as a conflict, i.e.  X depends on none of G  means that X cannot be included in the same build as any component that is a member of G. Groups are particularly useful with build dependencies, as they can ensure that certain sets of components are built before (or after) a particular component. Thus a component that relies upon state information that is preset by another component can specify a "build after" dependency to ensure that it is built after the other component. Components can also inherit the properties of other components via a component prototype. Each component can have a single prototype component, which may in turn also have a prototype. Thus there may be an entire chain of prototypes. This chain always ends with a "root" prototype component from which all others are derived (directly or indirectly). When a component is instantiated into a configuration, an instance is created by merging the properties of the entire prototype chain in a process known as "collapsing". This allows properties that are common to many components to be stored in a single common prototype and then inherited by all the components that are derived from that prototype. This simple inheritance model is particularly important for component scripting. Ultimately, all the logic associated with a component is expressed as script that is stored in the component. Without prototype inheritance, this would imply that all components contain script. However, prototype inheritance allows most components to simply inherit the default script from the root prototype component. Finally, the Mantis component model also supports a well-defined versioning mechanism that allows different versions of components to co-exist within the database. Component instances within configurations are then tied to specific versions of a component, which reduces issues of "DLL hell" and other versioning problems. It also allows an OEM to control upgrades on a configuration-by-configuration basis. The CMI provides services to automate and manage the upgrading of configurations. TODO ResType and ResTYpe script (resources) Groups As explained above, dependency groups allow a component to express a dependency relationship to other components indirectly via a group. Mantis also supports two other classes of groups: Package Groups These groups are used to collect components together for administrative purposes. A package group allows a set of components to be managed as a single unit. For example, all the components in a package group can be deleted in a single operation. In addition, package groups are used to manage bulk component instance upgrades (e.g. to upgrade all the component instances in a configuration to a new service pack). Category Groups These groups are used to collect components together into functionally related categories. This is primarily used to assist in filtering and organizing components for display in the UI. For example, one category might be "Display Drivers" and contain all the components that define display adapter drivers. Categories are purely an organizational convenience. Note that a single component can be a member of any number of groups of any class. This allows, for example, a component to belong to more than one category. The group system in Mantis is extensible, allowing additional group classes to be created as necessary. TODO Repositories can be members of groups (RepositorySet) Configurations The data that defines a run-time image is known as a configuration. Configurations are stored as XML files (with a file extension of .SLX) and manipulated via the CMI (they are not part of the component database). A single XML configuration file can build several different types of run-time images, such as a "free" or "checked" version. Since configuration files are XML (i.e. text) files, existing source control tools (such as Visual SourceSafe) can be used for version control. Configurations contain global information about the run-time image and a list of component instances. Each instance references a component in the component database and also specifies per-instance configuration data. It is possible that a single configuration may contain multiple instances of the same component. All configurations that are based upon a specific platform instantiate a single special component known as the base component. This component is responsible for defining the minimum functionality required for the platform, which is typically achieved by specifying one or more dependencies. Platforms TODO Rule that governs how VIGUID/VSGUID are used with polymorphic PlatformGUID (i.e. if a component uses VIGUID, it cannot use other resources that are VSGUID???). A platform defines the type of target run-time being constructed. All of the information in the component database belongs to one (and only one) platform. In addition, each configuration is bound to a specific platform when it is created. In effect, each platform represents a virtual, independent component database that exists independently of other platforms within the same physical database. Platforms are used to define the target operating system, CPU, locale and other variants that are handled at the global database level. For example, one platform might be "Windows Embedded (x86)   US English". Since OS, CPU and locale are handled at the platform level, this implies that variants to an OS such as CPU or locale are handled as distinct, independent, component databases. This means that it is not possible (for example) to use a component designed for one locale as part of a build for a different locale. It is expected that the UI tools will present a list of available platforms when creating a new configuration. From that time on only the portions of the database that are associated with that platform will be accessible when editing that configuration. Platforms also contain script. This script is inherited by each configuration that is based upon that platform. The platform script is invoked in response to various CMI events to drive operations such as dependency checking and overall build processing. Build Process The build process uses the information in a configuration to construct a complete run-time image. The build process is driven by the CMI but the actual logic for the build output is stored within individual component definitions as script. Thus a component instance is viewed as an object that knows how to build itself. Although a component instance is required to build itself, very few components actually need to contain explicit build script. This is because most instances inherit the script from a prototype component. If a component does not specify otherwise, it automatically inherits from the platform "root" component. This component provides script that defines the default build behavior for all components in that platform. During the build, the CMI is responsible for providing services to the components to assist in building (e.g. services to copy files to the target). All other build processing is handled by either platform or component script. Typically, the platform script controls each phase of the build process and resolves the build dependency graph to control the order in which components are built into the final run-time. The combination of a multi-phase build and the rich semantics within the dependency graph allows the build process to handle any component interdependencies. Database Overview The component database contains the component information used when building a Mantis run-time image. This database is read-only for builds, and is only altered under the following circumstances: A carrier file is imported. A primary object is deleted (e.g. a Platform, Group etc). A repository is moved or rebased (see below for rebase details). It is expected that the tools that manage the database will access a single database only. This database will be opened when the tools are started, and closed when the tools exit. However, the CMI allows access to multiple databases (via multiple CMI objects) to allow for future expansion. The location of a database depends upon the underlying database engine. For Jet, the database will be a simple .MDB file, while for SQL Server it will be an OLEDB or ADO data source. The database is accessed indirectly via the CMI services. The database itself may reside on the same computer as the tools and CMI services, or it may be remote (for example, on a server running SQL Server). It is not expected that the CMI services themselves will be remoted (for example, via DCOM). Access to the database is transacted to allow multi-user access. Data Storage and Formats Persistent state information in Mantis is expressed in one of three formats: As text data in an XML file. As tables and fields in the component database. As object properties. Of these formats, only the first and last are visible formats. The internal component database representation is not exposed outside of the CMI, either to application code (e.g. UI tools) or to script executing within a configuration or instance. Therefore the exact representation of this data is not a part of this specification, although considerations as to how this data may be efficiently managed have influenced the Mantis design to a considerable extent. The three data formats expressed above are closely inter-related, as follows: All of the information stored in the component database is obtained via an import process from one or more XML carrier files (with a file type of .SLD). This import process is the sole mechanism for adding to or modifying the information in the component database. Information in the component database is accessed via the Mantis object model. This exposes the data as properties on COM objects and COM object collections. However, these properties are all read-only they cannot be used to alter the component database data. Configuration information is stored in XML configuration files (with a file type of .SLX), with one configuration per file. When a configuration is opened this data is exposed as properties on COM objects in the Mantis object model. Most of these properties are read-write, allowing the configuration to be manipulated by modifying the object properties, or adding or deleting objects as necessary. Thus all the information stored in the component database originates in XML carrier files and is exposed as read-only properties on one or more COM objects. Configuration information is stored and processed directly in XML files that are exposed as read-write properties on one or more COM objects. See the section Object Model below for more information on the Mantis object model. Data Types All of the data in Mantis is manipulated as one of a set of defined data types. These data types have different representations in XML, the component database, and as object properties. Therefore, Mantis defines the format for each type when manipulated in each environment. Table 2 describes each data type and it's representation both as XML and object properties (as noted above, the internal database format is not exposed in this specification). Table 2: Mantis Data Types and Formats XML Format Property Format Empty Value Binary An ordered sequence of pairs of hexadecimal digits. Each pair encodes one byte of binary data, with the upper nibble encoded by the first digit, and the lower nibble encoded by the second digit. An array of unsigned 8-bit integers (VT_UI1). An empty array (no elements). String The literal Unicode string expressed as XML CDATA. A Unicode string. XML entities such as &quot; are converted as necessary by the CMI (VT_BSTR). An empty (zero length) string. Integer A sequence of decimal digits, optionally prefixed with a sign character. A 32-bit signed integer (VT_I4). Not allowed. Boolean For False, one of the following literals: "0", "False", "No", "Off". For True, one of the following literals, "1", "True", "Yes", "On". A Boolean value, either True or False (VT_BOOL). Not allowed. Multi An ordered sequence of quads of hexadecimal digits. Each quad encodes a single Unicode character, and is comprised of two digit pairs, encoded as for Binary data above. The first digit pair encodes the LSB, the second encodes the MSB. Individual strings are terminated by a NUL character, i.e. by the text "0000". There is no additional NUL character at the end of the sequence. An array of strings (VT_BSTR). An empty array (no elements). A script expression as literal text. A string containing the expression (VT_BSTR). The expression will be evaluated using the ambient language for the object. Not allowed. Script Zero or more script statements as literal text. A string containing the statements, possibly separated by newline characters as required. The statements will be executed using the ambient language for the object. Not allowed. Object A persisted COM object. The format is opaque except to IPersistStream or IPersistStreamInit. A COM object. Not allowed. A COM GUID in registry format, i.e. as text. A string containing the GUID in registry format. Not allowed. TimeDate A date in the form mm/dd/yyyy and/or a time in the form hh:mm:ss. Times are 24-hour and dates and times are always UTC. A time/date value (VT_DATE). Not allowed. XxxEnum An attribute with a series of predefined allowed values (as specified by the DTD). A COM enumeration. Not allowed. Most of the data types, such as String and Integer, are self-evident. However, the Binary format is encoded as hexadecimal digit sequences when represented as XML. For example, the following XML element contains the binary data sequence 0x54, 0x6E, 0x34: <ANELEMENT>546E34</ANELEMENT> The Multi data type represents a "multi-string", that is, a single data item that is comprised of multiple discrete strings. When represented as XML, characters in the strings are encoded as hexadecimal digits, and since the strings are Unicode, four digits are used for each character. Individual strings are terminated with a NUL character (0x0000 encoding). Characters are encoded in little-endian format. For example, the pair of strings "12" and "345" can be encoded as a single Multi value in XML as follows: <ANELEMENT>3100320000003300340035000000</ANELEMENT> Note The Windows registry terminates the entire multi-string item with an additional NUL character to indicate the end of the entire data item. This additional NUL character is not present when encoding a Multi data item as XML. For XML attribute enumerations, the CMI will convert the text format of the enumeration as expressed by the Mantis DTD into a COM enumeration. For example: <GROUP GroupClass="Package"> Here is the script to access this information: Set oGroup = GetObject( If oGroup.Class = cmiPackage Then  Since all Mantis data is sourced as XML attributes or elements, each data item may be undefined (element or attribute not present), empty (element or attribute defined but contains no text data) or present (element or attribute defined and contains data). The Mantis DTD specifies if elements/attributes are optional or required. For empty data values, the final column of table 2 above shows the result of processing empty data items. For example, the DTD may specify that a Decimal formatted attribute is optional. This means that the attribute is either not present, or if present the attribute must contain a valid decimal integer. Data Representation Each data item or property in Mantis is formatted according to the rules in the previous section. Individual items are then classified according to the manner in which they are represented in XML, and the way they are exposed as object properties. The following sections provide detailed information on the various data representation conventions used by Mantis. In addition, this information is summarized in Table 3. Table 3: Data Representation Characteristics Characteristic Element [E] Attribute [A] Extended [X] XML format Element Attribute PROPERTY element Data type Well known Well known Explicit or implicit Store as primary table field? Store in property table? Expose as object property? Expose in property collection? Parent objects Note The CMI is fully Unicode enabled, and supports the storage of Unicode strings, their presentation as Unicode text properties and the import of Unicode formatted XML files. Element Data Element data originates as the contents of XML elements, i.e. the text between the XML start and end tags of an element. Element data is tagged [E] in this document. By definition, element data is always originated as XML text. However, the actual data type of each specific element is well known. That is, the CMI implicitly understands the expected content of the data item and will convert and validate it as appropriate. For example: <DESCRIPTION>A Popular Game Show</DESCRIPTION> <CHECKSUM>4</CHECKSUM> Here, the CMI understands that the DESCRIPTION element is of type String and processes it as such. The CHECKSUM element is of type Integer and will be validated as such. The Mantis DTD file assists in documenting the expected element data types by representing those types as parameter entities. However, the DTD does not enforce data typing rules. Element data is typically directly exposed as object properties. For example: Set oFoo = GetObject( sDescription = oFoo.Description nChecksum = oFoo.Checksum Attribute Data Attribute data originates as the contents of XML attributes. Attribute data is tagged [A] in this document. Apart from its XML representation, attribute data is identical to element data. In Mantis, attribute data is generally used for fixed-length fields or short text fields. Element data is used for unbound fields or fields that may need to be localized. Here is an example of attribute data in XML: <PLATFORM     PlatformGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A822-C711570F145B}"     Revision="11" Here is the same data exposed as object properties: Set oFoo = GetObject( sPlatformGUID = oFoo.PlatformGUID nRevision = oFoo.Revision Extended Data Extended data originates as the contents of XML PROPERTY elements. Extended data is tagged [X] in this document. Almost all objects in Mantis support extended data, and no pre-defined limits are placed on the type, content, or number of extended data items that are associated with each object. Each extended data item is represented in XML format as the contents of a PROPERTY element. In addition, each PROPERTY element has a Name attribute that uniquely names the extended data item for a particular object. The namespace for the Name attribute is unique to each individual object, so that different objects can share the same property name without collision. Here is an example XML extended data item: <PROPERTY Name="Length" Format="Integer">14000</PROPERTY> Extended data is accessed via a Properties collection on the parent object. Here is code to access the previous example, assuming it is associated with a GROUP primary object: Set oGroup = GetObject( Set oExtProp = oGroup.Properties("Length") Wscript.Echo "Length is" & oExtProp.Value Extended data differs from element and attribute data in that the format and contents of the data is not well known to the CMI. Instead, the format of the data is stated explicitly as the Format attribute of the PROPERTY element (Integer in the example above). XML Representation The Mantis architecture defines a single DTD, Mantis.dtd, to define all the XML file formats used. This DTD defines two root XML elements, DCARRIER and XCARRIER. The DCARRIER element is used to contain carrier data, and is used to import data into the component database, while the XCARRIER element is used to contain configuration data that describes a single run-time configuration. XML files that contain a DCARRIER root element have a file type of .SLD, while those that contain an XCARRIER root element have a file type of .SLX. The DCARRIER element contains an arbitrary set of elements, each of which corresponds to one of the primary objects defined in this document. Each primary object element, in turn, contains appropriate attributes and secondary elements to define the data associated with the primary object. The nesting of secondary elements in primary elements corresponds to the relationships between primary and secondary objects as described in the section Object Model below. The following example shows a complete carrier file that defines a Platform object using a PLATFORM element and additional secondary elements. <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision="1"> <PLATFORM     PlatformVSGUID="{63A6BF93-C0FC-4035-9EE4-806F21722FBC}"     PlatformVIGUID="{1C1ADFDF-6867-447d-B1F6-99DD43591F8C}"     Revision="2"     DefaultProtoVIGUID="{4B084167-4A41-4366-8195-C04E306F7EB4}"     BaseComponentVIGUID="{5FF778EE-DA58-456f-B955-0F737DAE86AA}"     LCID="1033"     <PROPERTY Name="Beta" Format="Integer">3</PROPERTY>     <DISPLAYNAME>Windows Embedded (x86) - US English</DISPLAYNAME>     <VERSION>1.0</VERSION>     <DESCRIPTION>Windows Embedded Platform</DESCRIPTION>     <COPYRIGHT>Copyright (c) 2000 Microsoft Corp.</COPYRIGHT>     <VENDOR>Microsoft</VENDOR>     <DATECREATED>01/06/2000</DATECREATED>     <DATEREVISED>01/29/2000</DATEREVISED> </PLATFORM> </DCARRIER> The PLATFORM element contains several attribute data items (PlatformVSGUID etc) as well as several element data items (DISPLAYNAME etc). Finally, the PLATFORM element also contains an extended data item named Beta that contains Integer data. Note The Mantis DTD restricts the order in which elements can appear in many cases. Check the Mantis.dtd file for more information. Descriptive Properties All primary objects share a common set of properties known as descriptive properties. These are defined in table 4. All of the descriptive properties are element properties, and are thus defined using individual elements in a carrier file. The property names match the element names within the XML file, except that XML element names are always expressed in upper case. Table 4: Standard Descriptive Properties Property Meaning Authors String [E] Object author Email addresses, separated by semicolons. Copyright String [E] Copyright text for the object (localized). DateCreated TimeDate [E] Date object was created (not localized). DateRevised TimeDate [E] Date object was last revised (not localized). Description String [E] Description of the object (localized). Typically used by UI e.g. as tooltip text. DisplayName String [E] Name of the object (localized). Typically used by UI to show a "friendly" object name rather than a GUID. Do not include version information in this property. Owners String [E] Object owner Email addresses, separated by semicolons. Vendor String [E] Name of object vendor (localized). Version String [E] Object version (arbitrary text). This property is never used to compare versions. The Revision property is used for this purpose. All the descriptive properties except DateCreated and DateRevised are essentially comment fields, with no pre-defined semantics. In particular, the Version property should not be used by software to attempt any form of version checking/comparison. All of these fields may be localized. The DateCreated property specifies the date when the property information for the object was first created. The DateRevised property specifies when the property information was last revised (and the Revision property incremented). For immutable objects the DateCreated and DateRevised properties will always have the same value. Constraints All data items have an upper limit of 8000 bytes for the value. Also, the combined size of all data items in a single object cannot exceed 8000 bytes, except for platform and component script. Object Model All of the data stored and processed by the Mantis architecture is accessed via the Mantis Object Model. This model defines a series of COM objects, all of which are Automation enabled, that provide access to all of the features of the architecture. The Mantis object model has two types of clients: User interface tools that access the Mantis objects to drive the Windows Embedded (and other) user experience. Internal script that executes in response to certain events and actions, some of which may be initiated by UI tools. The UI tools are assumed to be the primary "driver" of the Mantis architecture, and allow the user to import carrier files into the component database, create and manipulate configurations, and initiate run-time image builds. In addition, as explained in the introduction, many Mantis operations are performed by script that is stored in the component database or configurations. This script also has full access to all Mantis objects. The Mantis object model is implemented by the CMI. Mantis Objects Figure 2 below shows the Mantis object model.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 2: Mantis Object Model Each of the objects shown in figure 2 is either a primary or a secondary object. Primary objects (shown in italic in figure 2) are essentially stand-alone objects that are made available as a result of importing data into the database from a carrier file. All primary objects have either one or two unique GUIDs that identify them. Secondary objects generally specify data that is logically contained within a primary object. For example, a Component primary object can specify a list of Resource objects. Each resource is represented as a secondary Resource object (which does not have a GUID). All of the persistent state associated with the Mantis objects is stored in one of two places: in the component database or in a configuration file. In figure 2, the Config object and all of its child objects are stored in a configuration file. Conversely, the Platform object and all of its child objects are stored in the database. There is thus a single database (possibly containing many platforms), but many configuration files, each of which contains a single Config object. The configuration file is thus the Mantis equivalent of a document file. Root Objects The mantis architecture defines two root objects. All other objects are accessed, directly or indirectly, from these objects. The root objects are: The CMI object (ProgID CMI.CMI). This object provides access to all the top-level CMI objects. The Utilities object (ProgID CMI.Utilities). This object provides access to a library of helper functions that are primarily used by component and configuration script. The following VBScript code will create both objects: Dim oCMI, oUtil Set oCMI = CreateObject("CMI.CMI") Set oUtil = CreateObject("CMI.Utilities") The CMI object, as the root object for the entire object hierarchy, is used extensively. Therefore, as a convenience, most objects in the hierarchy provide a CMI property that returns a reference to the CMI object. Collections In figure 2, rounded boxes represent collections, which are assumed to yield a set of individual objects that then reference the next object in the hierarchy. For example, the Platforms collection yields individual Platform objects, each of which contain a Groups collection. Most collections are accessed via a GetXxx method on the parent object. For example: Set oPlatform = oCMI.GetPlatform(" Set oGroups = oPlatform.GetGroups Some collections are available as a property on an object. For example: Set oConfig = oCMI.OpenConfiguration(" Set oInstances = oConfig.Instances When a collection is accessed via a property, the property always returns the same collection. When a collection is accessed via a method, the method returns a new collection each time it is called. This distinction exists to allow the CMI to correctly manage internal object references. Extended Properties All objects in Mantis except the two root objects contain a collection of arbitrary extended properties. This collection is accessed via the Properties method of the object. For example: Set oExtProps = oConfig.Properties Each individual property in an extended property collection has a Name, Format and Value as described in Data Storage and Formats above. The CMI will return Nothing if an attempt is made to access an extended property that is not defined. For example: Set oExtProp = oConfig.Property("foo") If Not oExtProp Is Nothing Then     [use the property]     [default processing] End If Versioning Model Mantis implements a formal versioning scheme for all primary objects in the database. This scheme distinguishes between a "revision" or "update" (the terms are used interchangeably) to an object and an "upgrade" to an object. Revisions to an object conceptually generate a new version of the object that replaces earlier versions, while upgrades generate a new version that can co-exist side-by-side with the old version in the component database. The Mantis versioning scheme was designed to allow multiple different versions of an object to co-exist within the database and yet be clearly identified as different versions of the "same" object. For example, when a service pack ships a new version of a component, that version can be imported into the database without displacing the existing version. Existing configurations that rely on the previous version will continue to use the version of the component that they were authored against, while new configurations can use the new version. At a convenient time, a configuration that uses the old version can be manually or automatically upgraded to use the new version of the component. Each primary object type in Mantis is classified by the type of versioning it supports, as follows: Immutable These objects can never change. Alterations to immutable primary objects must result in the generation of a new object that is distinct from the old object on which it is based. Revisable These objects can be revised. A revised version of the object replaces all previous versions of that object in the Mantis database. Upgradeable These objects can be upgraded. An upgraded version is a new object that is distinct from previous versions, but can co-exist with these earlier versions in the Mantis database. Revisable + Upgradeable These objects can be both revised and/or upgraded. To support this scheme, primary objects support the properties shown in table 5. Table 5: Versioning Properties Property Meaning VSGUID GUID [A] Unique identifier for all objects. VIGUID GUID [A] Shared identifier for upgradeable objects. Revision Integer [A] Object revision ordinal. Version Text [E] Arbitrary descriptive text for version. The Version property is simply a comment. It is not used programmatically by Mantis but is used by the tools to display a user-friendly version number when necessary. The Revision property is a simple ordinal value where a higher value represents a "newer" version of an object. Revisions need not be sequential, but any changes that are made to an object must be accompanied by an increase in the value of the Revision property. A Revision value of 0 is reserved. It is recommended that the initial version of an object be marked revision 1, and that subsequent revisions increment this revision value by 1. Revision values of 100,000 and greater have special significance for end-of-life components (see below). Changing an object without incrementing the revision ordinal for that object represents a gross authoring error. Always increment the revision ordinal when editing any object, no matter how trivial the change. Primary objects that are not upgradeable (i.e. are either immutable or revisable) are uniquely identified by a single VSGUID (version specific GUID) property. Primary objects that are upgradeable have an additional VIGUID (version independent GUID) property. The VSGUID provides a unique object "name" that is specific to a particular version of the object. The VIGUID provides a shared object "name" that is common to all the different versions of the "same" object. Note that, in Mantis, "sameness" in this context is defined to mean that the objects share the same VIGUID. Figure 3 shows an example of component versioning.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 3: Component Versioning Mantis defines the following "versioning" operations on primary objects: Revising an Immutable Object Since immutable objects are not revisable, changes to these objects must result in the generation of a new object. Therefore, when an immutable object is revised, it is assigned a new VSGUID to distinguish it from the old object. The Revision property should inherit and continue the revision value of the old object. Thus, for example, if the old object was revision 40 the new object should be revision 41. Revising a Revisable Object When a revisable object is revised, the Revision value is increased but the VSGUID of the object is not altered. This creates a new revision of the same object. Typically, the Version property is updated to reflect the change to the object. Revising an Upgradeable Object This follows the same procedure as for a revisable object. Note that the VIGUID property is not altered. Upgrading an Upgradeable Object When an object is upgraded, a new object is created for the new revision. Thus upgrading is similar to the process of generating a new immutable object. However, when an upgradeable object is upgraded it retains the current VIGUID property. Table 6 summarizes the various revision/upgrade scenarios. Table 6: Revision and Upgrade Scenarios Scenario Revision VSGUID VIGUID Revise Immutable Object Incremented Revise Revisable Object Incremented Unchanged Revise Upgradeable Object Incremented Unchanged Unchanged Upgrade Upgradeable Object Incremented Unchanged As table 6 shows, any change to an object increments the Revision property, even when a new object is generated. Revisions to revisable and upgradeable objects result in an object with the same VSGUID but a new Revision value. Mantis will then use the Revision value to resolve versioning issues on these objects. Upgrades to an object result in a new object, as defined by the new VSGUID property. However, the new object inherits the previous objects VIGUID. The sharing of a common VIGUID allows Mantis to track a chain of versions for the same object via the shared VIGUID. When a new object is created or upgraded, the DateCreated and DateRevised properties should be set to the date of creation. When an object is revised, the DateRevised should be set to the date of the revision. End of Life Objects Eventually many objects reach retirement, meaning that no new versions of the object are likely to be released. Sometimes, this simply means that the final version of the object remains valid, but will never be upgraded. In other cases, however, when an object reaches the end of it's life, use of that object must be actively discouraged. This can happen, for example, when a component is superceded by a totally new component that is not directly related to the previous one (and hence cannot be viewed as just a new version using VIGUID/VSGUID connection semantics). When the chain of object versions must be explicitly ended, a special "end of life" (EOL) object is placed at the end of the version chain to act as a tombstone for the objects in the chain. EOL objects are indicated using a Revision value of 100,000 or greater. Also, EOL objects typically have a Visibility level of 0. It is permissible (though rare) for an EOL object to be revised or upgraded, in which case, as usual, the Revision property will be incremented (for example, to 100,001). Thus, the "most recent" EOL object can be determined easily. Component objects provide the most common use of EOL objects. When a component is retired, an EOL object for that component is added to the database to indicate that the component is no longer valid. UI tools are expected to recognize the special EOL version and handle it accordingly. Components also support a special Branch resource that is only valid in an EOL component object. The Branch resource contains a property, TargetVIGUID, which contains the VIGUID of a replacement component. The Branch resource may thus indicate a new component that replaces the function of the EOL component. The Branch resource also contains an optional MinRevision property that indicates the minimum revision level of the target component that may be used as a replacement for the current component. If not specified or 0, any revision level may be used. By using or not using Branch resources in an EOL component, a number of different scenarios are possible: If the EOL component does not specify a Branch resource, then the component is dead, and has no replacement component. If the EOL component specifies a single Branch resource, then the component is replaced by the new component specified by the TargetVIGUID. The MinRevision property can be used to ensure that only appropriate versions of the new component are used. If the EOL component specifies multiple Branch resources, then the component is replaced by all the components specified. This is termed a "fission" EOL since the original component has, in effect, been broken into multiple new components. If several different EOL components specify Branch resources that all reference the same target component, these components are said to "fuse" into the single new component. Hybrid scenarios are also possible, where an EOL component fissions into several new components, some of which are fusions with other components. Figure 4 shows an example of a component fission using branches.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 4: Component Fission Example The flexible fission/fusion scheme enabled by Branch resources allows components to evolve over time, and to track the vagaries of software development processes. Component Model Component as set of properties and resources. Component as prototype chain. Component dependencies. Component as member of groups How resources work: restypes Component as scripted resource. Lots of cross-refs to the other "model" sections. Group Model Groups are objects that are used to collect other object types together. Once collected into a group, operations can be applied to the group as a whole. Groups are also used to indicate a shared property amongst a set of related objects. Groups can collect objects of two types: components and repositories. Other objects types (such as platforms) cannot be collected by groups. Mantis supports four classes of groups: Package Groups These groups are used to collect components together for administrative purposes. A package group allows a set of components to be managed as a single unit. For example, all the components in a package group can be deleted in a single operation. In addition, package groups are used to manage bulk component instance upgrades (e.g. to upgrade all the component instances in a configuration to a new service pack). Category Groups These groups are used to collect components together into functionally related categories. This is primarily used to assist in filtering and organizing components for display in the UI. For example, one category might be "Display Drivers" and contain all the components that define display adapter drivers. Categories are purely an organizational convenience. Dependency Groups These groups are used to collect components together to indicate inter-component build dependencies. See the section Dependency Model for more information on dependency groups. RepositorySet Groups These groups are used to collect repositories together to indicate sets of repositories that are related by build type. Note that a single component can be a member of any number of groups of any class. This allows, for example, a component to belong to more than one category. The group system in Mantis is extensible, allowing additional group classes to be created as necessary. Dependency Model Component functionality is almost never defined in isolation. Typically, a component requires the services of other components in order to function correctly. This inter-component relationship is known as a dependency. The Mantis architecture exposes a rich dependency model that allows complex inter-component relationships to be described. These relationships ensure that adequate support is available in a run-time image for the selected components, and that the run-time image is constructed in the correct order. The dependency information is integrated into the Mantis component database. From there, it is used in three ways: To validate a configuration, by checking that all the dependency requirements of components included in a configuration have been satisfied. To automatically include "dependee" components when a dependent component is included in a configuration. To control the order in which components are added to the run-time image at build time. Simple Dependencies The simplest dependency specifies that one component depends upon another. For example: X ( Y Means "component X depends upon component Y". In this example, component X is the dependent component and component Y is the dependee component. In Mantis, all dependencies are expressed by the dependent component. That is, the previous example rule would be included as part of the definition of component X, not component Y. Dependencies are transitive. That is, if we have two rules: X ( Y Y ( Z Then component X implicitly depends upon component Z. The transitive property of dependencies means that including a single component in a Mantis build can cause a cascade effect that includes many other components via direct and indirect dependencies. Simple dependencies directly connect one component with another. Group dependencies indirectly connect components via dependency groups. Each component can belong to any number of dependency groups. Group dependencies are then specified using a dependee group instead of a dependee component. For example: X ( G Means "component X depends upon group G". A group cannot replace a dependent component, only a dependee component the relationship G ( Y is not valid. Group dependencies are resolved by means of group membership. For example, if component Y is a member of group G, then X ( G effectively means X ( Y. This is expressed as: X ( G(Y) Which states the component X depends upon group G, and group G has component Y as a member. The most obvious advantage of group-based dependencies is that they add a level of indirection between components. This allows a component to express its dependencies even before the dependee components have been fully authored. Groups are also very useful with some of the more advanced dependency types described in the next section. Since a group cannot replace a dependee component, groups cannot contain other groups as members, only components. This means that "double indirect" component dependencies are not allowed. For example, X ( G1(G2) is not allowed. Dependency Types The example dependencies in the previous section are all of type All. An All type dependency (which is the default dependency type) means that the dependent component depends upon all of the dependee components. For non-group dependencies, this dependency type is tautological. Since components are atomic, X ( Y obviously means component X depends on all of component Y. No other interpretation is possible. For group dependencies, an All dependency means that all the components in the group are required. The symbol for an All dependency is *(, so: X *( G(A,B,C) Means that component X depends upon all of group G. Since G has components A, B and C as members, this means that component X is dependent upon components A, B and C. Thus this rule is equivalent to the following three rules. X ( A X ( B X ( C The All dependency is one type of dependency. Other dependency types are shown in table 1. Table 1: Dependency Type Values Value Symbol Meaning DependencyTypeFromGroup Take type from group. DependencyTypeExactlyOne Exactly one of the dependent components must be present. DependencyTypeAtLeastOne At least one of the dependent components must be present. DependencyTypeZeroOrOne Either none or exactly one of the dependent components must be present. DependencyTypeAll All the dependent components must be present. This is the default dependency type. DependencyTypeNone None of the dependent components may be present (exclusion). The FromGroup dependency is not actually a true dependency type. Dependency types can be specified in both components are groups. If a component specifies a FromGroup dependency type then the type of the dependency comes from the group, rather than from the component. The FromGroup dependency type is only valid in components, not groups, and the dependency target must be a group. If the component specifies any other dependency type, the dependency type in the component over-rides the dependency type in the group. Thus dependency types in groups are, in effect, default types that are used only when a component specifies the FromGroup dependency type. Table 2 summarizes the individual dependency types and their meaning when used with simple and group dependencies. This table actually applies specifically to include class dependencies. Dependency classes are discussed below. Table 2: Include Dependency Type Semantics Symbol X ( Y X ( G Notes ExactlyOne Y is included. Exactly one member of G is included. AtLeastOne Y is included. At least one member of G is included. ZeroOrOne Ignored. At most, one member of G may be included. For simple dependencies, this type has no meaning since it allows component Y to be included or not included. Y is included. All members of G must be included. This is the default dependency type. Y is excluded. All members of G are excluded. The None dependency represents a conflict between components. As shown in table 2, most of the dependency types have the same meaning when applied to simple component dependencies. The exceptions are the ZeroOrOne and the None dependency. The ZeroOrOne dependency has no meaning when used with a simple dependency. For example: X ?( Y Means that component X requires that component Y is either included or not included. This is null dependency, since it has absolutely no effect. The None dependency is, in effect, a logical "not" operation. For example: X 0( Y Means that component X is dependent on not component Y, or that component X conflicts with component Y. When applied to groups, a None dependency is interpreted to mean that the conflict includes all the components in the group. For example: X 0( G(A,B) Means that component X conflicts with group G. Since G has components A and B as members, this means that X conflicts with both components A and B. So the previous example is equivalent to: X 0( A X 0( B Certain self-referential rules are valid. For example: X 1( G(X,Y,Z) This dependency means that component X is dependent upon exactly one of group G. In this case group G includes component X as a member. This type of dependency can be used to author sets of components that are mutually exclusive. Dependency Contradictions It is possible to construct sets of dependencies that are internally contradictory. Most such sets involve the use of at least one None dependency in cyclic deadlock. For example: X 0( X This simple dependency says that component X conflicts with itself. This makes the inclusion of component X impossible. Such a dependency rule is obviously invalid and easy to detect, but more complex contradictions are possible. For example: X *( G1(A,B,C) X 0( G2(C,D) Here, the first rule states that component X requires all of group G1, and the second rule that component X conflicts with all of group G2. However, groups G1 and G2 share component C as a member. Therefore these two rules contradict one another, and again make inclusion of component X impossible. The previous examples show self-contradictory component rules. These rule sets are invalid and should not even exist within the component database. However, other contradictory rule sets exist that are only contradictory for certain combinations of component instances. For example: X 1( G(A,B) A ( B Here, component X depends on exactly one of group G, which includes components A and B as members. This dependency set is not contradictory for the component instance set {X, B} but is contradictory for the set {X, A}. This is because if A is chosen with X, then the second rule will force the inclusion of component B, but this will contradict the ExactlyOneOf rule by including both components A and B. Thus this rule set is valid as a component database rule set. Another case involves shared but different group requirements: X ?( G(A,B) Y *( G X ( Y Here, component X depends upon zero or one members of group G, while component Y depends upon all members of group G. This is not contradictory until the third rule, which makes component X dependent upon Y. These rules can only be satisfied if group G contains only one component. Since G contains components A and B, a contradiction arises over whether both A and B or only one of A and B are to be included. Revision Constraints Component dependencies can be further qualified by a revision constraint. A revision constraint states that "component X depends upon revision >=N of component Y". For example: X (N Y Revision constraints can be applied to all dependency types. The constraint is resolved against the revision of each component that is included as a result of the constraint. For example: X *(N G(A,B) This means that component X is dependent upon revision N (or greater) for both components A and B. Multiple revision constraints are also possible. For example: X *(N1 G(A,B) X (N2 B Assuming N2 > N1, then component X is dependent upon revision N1 or greater of component A and revision N2 or greater of component B. Revision constraints apply only to include dependencies (see Dependency Classes for more information). Dependency Classes Aside from its type, each dependency also has a class, which specifies how the dependency is used by the Mantis system. The examples in the previous sections have assumed the most common dependency class, the include dependency class. Other dependency classes are shown in table 3. Table 3: Dependency Class Values Value Symbol Meaning DependencyClassNone No class (not valid). DependencyClassInclude Include dependency. This is the default dependency class. DependencyClassBefore Build before dependency. DependencyClassAfter Build after dependency. DependencyClassRegistry Implied registry dependency. Include dependencies, as their name implies, control the inclusion or exclusion of components in a Mantis configuration. For example: X (& Y Means that component X is dependent upon the inclusion of component Y. Before and After dependencies are collectively known as build dependencies. Build dependencies do not cause the inclusion (or exclusion) of components, but instead are used to restrict the order in which components are built during the build process. For example: X (> Y Means that component X is dependent upon Y being built before X. In addition: X (< Y Means that component X is dependent upon Y being build after X. Note that the before/after relationship is related to the dependent component. That is, X (> Y means that Y is built before X, not the other way around. In effect, the component X (which is where the dependency resides) is stating "I require Y to be built before me." Build dependencies do not imply include dependencies. That is, the dependency: X (> Y Means "build Y before X if Y is included in the build". It is not considered an error to include X without Y in a build. Registry dependencies are a special variation of "build before" dependency. They are never explicitly expressed in a component, and are instead synthesized by an analysis of registry key processing specified by individual components. However, their action is identical to a normal build before dependency. Dependency classes can be used with groups and dependency types. For example: X *(& G(A,B) This is an explicit include all dependency. Since include dependencies are the default class, this is equivalent to: X ( G(A,B) Before and After dependencies can also be used with groups and types. For example: X *(> G Means that all of group G must be built before component X. The semantics of the various dependency types are slightly different for build dependencies. Table 4 shows the various build before dependency types, and table 5 shows the build after dependency types. Table 4: Build Before Dependency Type Semantics Symbol X ( Y X ( G Notes ExactlyOne Not valid. Not valid. AtLeastOne Y is built before X. Not valid. ZeroOrOne Not valid. Not valid. Y is built before X. All members of G are built before X. This is the default dependency type. Not valid. Not valid. Use the semantically equivalent "build all after". Note that terms such as "all" and "at least one of" are modified when used in the context of build dependencies where the dependency target is a group. The terms are assumed to apply only to the subset of the group that is actually instantiated into the build. For example: X *(> G(A,B,C) This rule is interpreted to mean that instances of components A, B and C are built before component X if they are included in the build. Thus, if the build includes components X, A and B the build order will be A, B and then X. The absence of component C is not considered an error. Note that the "ExactlyOne" and "ZeroOrOne" types are not valid for build order rules. The semantics of such rules are unclear given that the component author has already constrained which components may be included using include rules. The exclusion of these rules also allows build order resolution algorithms to resolve in linear time instead of factorial time. Table 5: Build After Dependency Type Semantics Symbol X ( Y X ( G Notes ExactlyOne Not valid. Not valid. AtLeastOne Y is built after X. Not valid. ZeroOrOne Not valid. Not valid. Y is build after X. All members of G are built after X. This is the default dependency type. Not valid. Not valid. Use the semantically equivalent "build all before". Include dependencies are typically combined with build dependencies. For example: X +(& G(A,B) X (> A The first include rule specifies that component X requires at least one of components A or B to be included. The second rule specifies that component A must always be built before component X. This means that if the set {X,A} is chosen the build order will be A then X, while if the set {X,B} is chosen the build order is undefined (and may be B then X or X then B). Dependency Examples Simple dependencies are used to express functional requirements between components. For example, if component X uses the services of component Y, then this will typically be expressed as an include dependency: X ( Y Typical examples of these dependencies occur when a component makes use of a common DLL or shared library. Group dependencies can be used when one of many different components can satisfy the service requirements of a component. For example, the video display driver might depend upon any mini-port driver. This can be expressed as: VideoDriver 1( MiniPortGroup Individual mini-port drivers can then declare that they are members of the mini-port group. Group dependencies can also be used to ensure mutual-exclusion. For example, if one (and only one) of a set of components is allowed in a system, they can each refer to a mutual-exclusion group: X 1( ExGroup Y 1( ExGroup Then, each component (X and Y in this case) declares itself a member of the ExGroup. Build dependencies are used to ensure that state information required by one component during build time is constructed before the component. Network driver binding is an example of a complex dependency requirement. Binding the various network protocols together is a complex process. This process is typically handled by a special "binding" component. All components that require binding then specify an include dependency on this component. For example: ProtocolA ( NetBinder ProtocolB ( NetBinder NICDriverA ( NetBinder NICDriverB ( NetBinder Obviously, the NetBinder component must build after all the other components that include it. This can be done in one of two ways: First, each individual component can use a build after dependency to force the NetBinder component to build after the individual component. For example: ProtocolA (< NetBinder ProtocolB (< NetBinder NICDriverA (< NetBinder NICDriverB (< NetBinder Alternatively, each individual component can declare itself a member of a group, and the NetBinder component can then define a build before dependency on that group. For example: NetBinderGroup = (ProtocolA, ProtocolB etc) NetBinder *(> NetBinderGroup The second method is more efficient; since all that is required is that a component declares that it is a member of the NetBinderGroup group. Script Model The requirement to create a generic toolset and CMI that is not tightly coupled to the target OS architecture means that the logic involved in many fundamental Mantis operations is not present within the body of the CMI. Instead, this logic is encoded as script that is stored within certain objects and then used by the CMI to implement key functionality. Mantis uses script as follows: Platform objects supply script text that is used in the context of a Config object. Component objects supply script text that is used in the context of an Instance object. ResType objects supply script text that is used in the context of a ResType object. Component objects supply DHTML text that is used to edit the properties of an instance object. Notice that all the script text is actually sourced from the component database. Thus, the ultimate origin of all Mantis script is via the import of .SLD carrier files. In contrast, the script is active only in the context of a configuration (except for ResType script). Rather than invent another script language, Mantis uses existing script standards. Configuration and instance objects actually act as ActiveX Scripting hosts, thus allowing any standard ActiveX Script language (such as VBScript or JScript) to be used to author the script. In addition, interactive property editing for an instance object is performed using DHTML, which may of course itself contain standard script elements. Although Mantis supports any ActiveX scripting language, the appropriate ActiveX script language must of course be installed before it can be used. Thus, if a component is authored using (say) Perl, this component can only be used on systems where ActivePerl is already installed. Thus it is recommended that VBScript be used for all normal scripting tasks. To illustrate how Mantis uses script, consider how a run-time image build actually occurs. The build operation is initiated by the UI tools calling the Build method on a Config object. Surprisingly, however, the CMI does not itself contain any run-time image build logic. Instead, all it does in response to the Build method is invoke a procedure called cmiDoBuild within the configuration script. It is this procedure that is totally responsible for processing the build request to completion. Although the CMI expects the script to handle all of the build (and other) logic associated with a particular platform, it does provide helper functions in the Utilities object that assist in common build operations. In addition, script has full access to the CMI object model. As noted above, the configuration script is obtained from the Platform object. Thus, it is ultimately the platform that defines the semantics of a build operation. This is logically correct, as the requirements of a build vary from platform to platform. Platform Script Management Platform objects can contain script. As noted above, all script originates in the component database, and hence as elements within an .SLD carrier file. The actual script text for a platform is held in a SCRIPTTEXT element. The SCRIPTTEXT element specifies the script language using a language attribute. When a Platform object is imported into the component database, the script text stored within the object definition in the carrier file is imported with the platform and stored in the component database. Then, when a new configuration is created based on that platform, the script text is copied into the Config object, and is subsequently saved as part of the configuration in the .SLX file. Thus, all Config objects have associated with them a block of script text (stored in a SCRIPTTEXT element). When a configuration is opened the CMI automatically creates an ActiveX site for this script and places the IDispatch handler for the script into the Config.Script property. The script is placed in the run state immediately after the Config object is created. In addition, the CMI creates a special global object named cmiThis. This object contains a reference to the Config object, thus allowing the script direct access to the current configuration, and (through cmiThis.CMI) the CMI object itself. Note All items placed in the script global namespace by the CMI are prefixed with "cmi" to distinguish them from global items created and used by the script. Script authors should avoid the use of this prefix in their own names to ensure that future namespace conflicts do not occur. Once the script block is activated, the CMI indicates certain actions by invoking procedures in the script in response to certain events. The script can then handle these events as appropriate. For example, adding a new Instance object to a script invokes the cmiOnAddInstance procedure. Since the CMI simply passes through Config.Build invocations to the cmiDoBuild procedure in the configuration script, invoking Config.Build is essentially equivalent to invoking Config.Script.cmiDoBuild. However, to ensure compatibility with future versions of the CMI do not bypass the CMI methods and call-down directly into configuration script. Component Script Management Component objects can also contain script. As noted above, this script is executed within the context of an Instance object. However, unlike Platform script, which is copied to a Config object when it is created, component script is referenced directly in the component database. Thus, when an Instance object is created by the CMI the appropriate script text block is located in the component database and activated. Like script in a configuration, an IDispatch reference for instance script is available in the Instance.Script property. In addition, the CMI creates a special global named cmiThis, which contains a reference to the current instance object. This object can be used, in turn, to locate references to the CMI and Config objects. Instance script is not invoked directly by the CMI. Instead, it is the responsibility of the configuration script to invoke procedures in the instance script as appropriate. For example, here is a simple cmiDoBuild implementation in configuration script: Sub cmiDoBuild     Dim oInstance     For Each oInstance In cmiThis.Instances         oInstance.Script.cmixDoBuild     Next End Sub This simple example (actual build code is far more complex) processes the build request by invoking the cmixDoBuild procedure in each individual instance object. Note By convention, procedures in component script that are invoked by configuration script are prefixed with "cmix". Using Instance script is actually more complex than shown above. This is a result of the presence of component prototypes. As explained elsewhere, each component in the Mantis component database has a prototype component, and this prototype may in turn also have a prototype. This list of prototypes thus forms a prototype "chain", which always terminates with a platform default prototype. When a component instance is created, the instance state data is initialized by collapsing the prototype chain to form an accumulation of the state data from each individual prototype. However, the component script is an exception to this rule. The individual script blocks from the component and its prototypes remain distinct (this is why, unlike configuration script, they are not copied from the component to the instance). Thus, the total script text for an Instance object is in fact comprised of multiple distinct script text blocks, one from each component in the prototype chain. When an Instance object is created, each of these distinct script blocks is activated within it's own script site. Thus, there are multiple script sites associated with a single Instance object. This is shown in figure 5. However, the CMI does not expose these individual script blocks. Instead, it links them together to form a single coherent script block with a single master IDispatch interface. It is this composite IDispatch interface that is exposed as the Instance.Script property. (This process is similar to that used in WSH when a single WSF file contains multiple individual script elements.) The linking forms a hidden list of individual script sites that are linked in the same order as the component prototype chain: the "main" component is at the head of the list, its prototype component is next, its prototype is next, and so on down the prototype chain. At the end of the chain, the script block from the platform-defined default prototype is always present. This linking is shown using dotted arrows in figure 5.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 5: Component Instance Script When an instance script procedure is accessed (or any other instance script global), the CMI attempts to locate this procedure in the script block at the head of the script list (i.e. in the "main" component script). If the procedure is located, it is executed. If not, the CMI searches in the next script block in the list. This search continues until the procedure is located. For example, if the procedure Foo is invoked against the chain shown in figure 5, the Foo procedure in the second script block executes. If the Bar procedure is invoked, the procedure in the first block executes. Thus, the script blocks from individual components in the prototype chain are linked into a simple single-inheritance object model, where "upstream" components can over-ride procedures supplied by "downstream" prototypes. This same search process also applies to procedure invocations that occur within the script itself. If a procedure is invoked that is not found in the current script block, the CMI will search the script chain starting with the next script block down the chain. In figure 5, the Bar procedure invokes the Foo procedure. Since this is not present in the current script block, the CMI will locate and execute the Foo procedure in the second script block. This search process applies to all global objects in the script. This means, for example, that the Bar procedure in figure 5 can access the variables x, y and z in the downstream script block. As shown in the Foo procedure in figure 5, upstream script can over-ride procedures in downstream script. However, when this occurs it might be necessary for the upstream procedure to explicitly invoke the original downstream version of the same procedure. In this case the Foo procedure cannot simply call Foo again, as this will be interpreted as a recursive call to the local procedure. Instead, the CMI provides an additional IDispatch reference in the special global cmiSuper. This IDispatch interface will always start searching beginning at the next script block downstream from the current block. Thus, the Foo procedure in the second script block can use cmiSuper.Foo to invoke the Foo procedure in the third script block. As noted above, the CMI provides a cmiThis variable that provides a reference to the instance object. Since Instance.Script exposes the composite IDispatch interface, cmiThis.Script also exposes this interface. Therefore a procedure can be invoked via this interface, for example cmiThis.Script.Foo. Since this invocation occurs directly on the CMI composite IDispatch, this is equivalent to an upstream search of the chain. That is, the search starts at the very top of the chain. In OO terms this is the equivalent of a virtual function invokation, since it allows a procedure in a downstream component to invoke procedures in upstream components. Thus there are three distinct ways to call a procedure in instance script. These are summarized in table 999. Table 999: Procedure Invocation Invocation Method Search Start Point Usage Current script, than all downstream (prototype) scripts. Use for local procedure invocation or downstream procedure invocation (i.e. calling a procedure in a prototype). cmiSuper.Foo Downstream scripts only. Use to explicitly invoke a downstream implementation of the current procedure only. cmiThis.Script.Foo Start of script chain (main component). Use to invoke a "virtual" procedure that may be over-ridden in an upstream component. Resource Script Management The third source of script used by Mantis is the ResType object. Like Config objects, each ResType object may have a SCRIPTTEXT element that defines a block of script. This script is then exposed as an IDispatch interface on the ResType.Script property. Like instance script, the CMI does not directly invoke the script on ResType objects. Instead, this script is typically invoked indirectly from configuration or instance script. The script associated with a ResType object is only valid within the context of a configuration. This means that the ResType.Script property is only valid when the ResType object is accessed via a Resource object that is part of a configuration or instance. It is not valid when the ResType object is accessed via a Platform or Component object. Scripted Properties Mantis also supports the concept of a scripted property. A scripted property is one that has a format of Expr or Script (see table 2). For Expr format properties, the value of the property is assumed to be an expression, while for Script properties, the value of the property is assumed to be a series of script statements. Regardless, of the type, the script language is assumed to be the same as the "ambient" language for the property. The ambient language is inherited from the language where the property is evaluated. Note Care must be taken when using scripted properties. An instance can have multiple script blocks. If each has a different ambient language it may be difficult to ensure that the property is only evaluated in the correct language. To avoid this issue it is advised that all component script blocks use the same language. At present, the default prototype component for Windows Embedded is VBScript, and so this language is recommended for most component script. Script Error Handing Scripts should report errors by raising exceptions. The exception should indicate the error cause via an error code. Table 999 lists error code ranges available for script use. Table 999: Script Exception Error Codes Range Usage 0 to 999 Basic error codes. Should not be used by script. 1000 to 4999 CMI error codes. Reserved for use by the CMI. 5000 to 9999 MS script error codes. Reserved for use by Microsoft created script. 10000+ OEM script error codes. Available for use by OEMS. Raising exceptions differs from language to language. Here is a VBScript example: Err.Number = 5012 Err.Raise CMI Events The CMI object provides two methods to allow configuration and instance script to communicate back to the UI tools. In both cases these methods fire an event in the UI tools. The first method is CMI.WriteMsg. This method is provided to allow script to send progress or other informative messages back to the tools. Text messages can be classified as information, warnings, or errors. For example: CMI.WriteMsg cmiInfoMsg, "Build complete." The second method is CMI.ReportStatus. This method is provided to allow script to communicate the status of long operations to the tools. Status reports are classified in the same manner as messages, and may also contain a context value (an arbitrary integer) and an additional data value (a variant value). The content and meaning of these parameters are defined by contract between the script and the tools. The CMI.ReportStatus method also allows the tools to return an integer status to the script, again with a meaning defined by the tools and script. For example: nRet = CMI.ReportStatus(Cint(cmiInfoMsg), 100, Null) A typical use of this method is to monitor the progress of the build. At intervals the script invokes the method, passing data on the progress. The tools can then return a "continue" or "abort" request in the return value.  Instance Editing and Configuration DHTML scripting: Editable, HTMLText, HTMLFinal, HTMLTitle, $$R$$ etc etc. Events Handling events CMI Object Object Type Versioning Parent Objects Child Objects Config, Platform Contained Objects The CMI object is the root object of the Mantis object hierarchy. Properties Property Default Meaning (ExtProps) Extended properties. See text. DBServerName String Name of server containing currently open component database, or an empty string if no database is currently open. Generation Integer Current database generation. Incremented after any change to current database. Description The CMI object is at the root of the Mantis object hierarchy. All other objects are derived, directly or indirectly, from this object. To obtain the initial CMI object use the ProgID "CMI.CMI". For example: Set oCMI = CreateObject("CMI.CMI") After obtaining the CMI object, a typical application will open a component database using the OpenDB method. After a database has been successfully opened all other methods and properties in the object model may be used as required. The DBServerName property contains the name of the current database server, or an empty string if no database is currently open. The Generation property is incremented after any change to the Mantis database. This allows external tools to cache portions of the database and later verify that the cached data is still valid before using it. The CMI object supports an extended property set for the currently opened database. This property set is only available when a database is open against the CMI object. These properties are global to the database, and are typically used by tools to record additional information that should be shared amongst all clients that use a particular database. The CMI also provides a distinct utilities object that provides helper methods. This object is primarily used by configuration and instance script. The ProgID of the utilities object is "CMI.Utilities". For example: Set oUtils = CreateObject("CMI.Utilities") Component Object Object Type Primary Versioning Revisable+Upgradable Parent Objects Platform, Group, Instance Child Objects Group Contained Objects Resource, Dependency A Component object represents a component the atomic unit of functionality that may be included as part of a run-time configuration.

ScriptLanguage String [A] Empty Identifies the ActiveX scripting engine to be used when processing the script. ScriptText String [E] Empty Component configuration script. Visibility Integer [A] Component visibility level. Description A Component object defines the core object of the Mantis architecture the component. Components consist of the following information: A set of core properties that describe general component state. A set of extended properties that describe the configuration of the component. A set of resources that list the "contents" of the component (e.g. files). An optional block of DHTML text and parameters that provide a GUI interface to edit the configuration of the component. An optional block of script that is used to define the behavior of the component when it is instantiated. An optional block of DHTML text provides help information on the component. A list of groups to which the component belongs. A list of dependencies that define the static and dynamic relationships between this component and other components. Components are used when they are instantiated into a configuration. This creates an Instance object that is derived from the component via a process known as "collapsing". Later, when a configuration is built, the instance contributes its resources to the build as necessary. Components are revisable and upgradeable, and hence have both a VSGUID and a VIGUID. This allows different versions of a component to be released and available within a single component database. The Released property indicates that a component is in a released state. It is used in two ways: As an indication that the component is potentially pre-release and may not be defect-free. To assist authoring tools in managing component definition editing. Typically, editing an unreleased component will cause the authoring tool to revise the component, while editing a released component will cause the authoring tool to upgrade the component (i.e. generate a new VSGUID). A component definition may include design-time help information. The HelpContext property contains optional help text for the component. This property may be formatted in one of two ways: As a block of DHTML text. Upon request, this text is displayed in a browser window. As a reference to an external help resource. Upon request, this resource is displayed to the user, using the appropriate viewer. In either case, before the text is processed or displayed, a special macro substitution process is invoked. This process scans the raw text for the special character sequence $$R$$. Whenever this sequence is found, it is replaced by the full path to the repository for this component without a trailing back-slash character. This substitution allows the DHTML to reference additional files within the repository (for example, to display graphical images). To specify an external help resource, the content of the HelpContext property must be formatted as follows: $$H$$=path-name Replace path-name with the full path of the resource. Typically, this will be an external CHM file containing the help information for the component. The path-name will typically use the $$R$$ macro sequence to allow it to refer to a file in the component repository. When a component is instantiated, the properties that comprise the state of the component may be edited. The Editable, HTMLText, HTMLFinal and HTMLTitle properties are used to control this process. See Script Model for more details on HTML instance editing and configuration. Note that the HTMLText data is processed using the same special macro rules as described for the HelpContext property. The IsMacro property marks the component as a macro component. Macro components differ from non-macro components in that they are not allowed to have resources. Instead, a macro component typically specifies its functionality via dependencies upon other components. Macro components are designed to allow fine-grain components to be collected together into one coarse grain component when the fine-grained approach may not be suitable for all authoring scenarios.

GroupVSGUID GUID [A] Uniquely identifies the group (version specific). PlatformGUID GUID [A] GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). Revision Integer [A] Group revision ordinal. Description Groups are used to collect other objects into sets of related objects. Currently, only components and repositories can be members of groups. The Group object itself does not manage group membership, and in fact a Group object is only used to hold descriptive information about the group. Instead group membership is declared within individual member objects, through GROUPMEMBER elements. This allows group membership to be incrementally extended as new objects are imported into the database, and also allows an object to be a member of any number of groups. Each group has a Class property, which describes the class of the group. Currently, four group classes are defined: Package These groups are used to collect components together for administrative purposes. A package group allows a set of components and/or repositories to be managed as a single unit. Category These groups are used to collect components together into functionally related categories. This is primarily used to assist in filtering and organizing components for display in the UI. Dependency These groups can be used as the target of dependencies (of all types). This allows a dependency to indirectly specify multiple components as a target. RepositorySet These groups are used to indirectly link a component to one or more repositories, and allow a component to choose a repository based upon the ambient build environment, typically by using the BuildType property. The DefaultDependencyType property of a group is used with dependency groups only. When a component dependency specifies a target that is a dependency group, the dependency can either explicitly specify the type of the dependency, or the dependency can specify that the dependency type information comes from the group. In this case, the dependency type information is specified by the DefaultDependencyType property. The DisplayName property of a group is used as usual as a descriptive comment. However, for category groups, the DisplayName property is structured to allow a pseudo-tree view of categories. The name is divided (by colons) into fields that represent the individual levels in the category tree. For example: Drivers : Display : Matrox The processing of this information is handled entirely by UI tools, and the use of colons as separators is only a usage convention that is not enforced by the CMI. Notice that for readability spaces are placed either side of the colon characters. UI tools that wish to display the category namespace as a tree should strip these spaces when processing the category names. One of the main uses of package groups is to assist in configuration upgrades. Although it is possible to upgrade individual instances in a configuration, it is frequently more efficient and desirable to bulk-upgrade sets of components based upon package group membership. For example, when SP6 is imported into the database, all components that are part of SP6 can be marked as such via an SP6 package group. It is then a simple task to correlate this component set to the instances in a configuration and automatically upgrade the entire configuration to SP6. RepositorySet groups are used to collect repositories into sets. Each component specifies its source repository via its RepositoryVSGUID property, but this property is polymorphic: it can specify either a Repository object or a RepositorySet group. If a group is specified then build script can choose the repository based upon other selection criteria, such as the BuildType. Constraints The VSGUID of the group must be unique and not used to name any other object of any other type within the database. Groups are revisable. Importing a group with the same VSGUID as another group causes the incoming group to overwrite the existing group if the new group has a revision that is greater than that of the existing group. If the incoming group has a lower revision number then the import of the group is skipped and a warning is generated. If the incoming group has an equal revision number then the import of the group is skipped, but no warning is generated. The PlatformGUID property must reference an existing Platform object in the database at the time of import. It is permissible for an object to be imported that references a group via a GROUPMEMBER element before that group has been imported into the database. The Class property is not restricted to the known enumeration values. The DefaultDependencyType property can have any value from the DependencyTypeEnum except FromGroup. Component objects may reference (via GROUPMEMBER elements) groups of class Package, Category or Dependency, but not groups of class RepositorySet. Repository objects may reference (via GROUPMEMBER elements) groups of class Package and RepositorySet, but not groups of class Category or Dependency.

This is the locale ID of the platform, and by extension all of the components and files within the platform. MinVisibility Integer Minimum visibility for filtered component set. See text. PlatformVIGUID GUID [A] Uniquely identifies the platform (version independent). PlatformVSGUID GUID [A] Uniquely identifies the platform (version specific). Revision Integer [A] Platform revision ordinal. ScriptEncoded Boolean [A] False Flags that the script is encoded in the database. ScriptLanguage String [A] Empty Identifies the ActiveX scripting engine to be used when processing the script. ScriptText String [E] Empty Script used by configurations based upon this platform. Description A platform defines a particular type of target run-time system described by the component database. Each individual platform defines a target operating system, CPU and locale. For example, "Windows Embedded (x86)   US English" might be one platform. All other objects in the database are owned, either directly or indirectly, by a specific platform, and thus each platform defines a discrete, logical database within the complete component database. In addition, each configuration is always owned by a specified platform, which is chosen when the configuration is first created. Platforms are revisable and upgradeable, and hence have both a VSGUID and a VIGUID. Platforms that do not share a VIGUID are totally independent and represent entirely unrelated operating system platforms (e.g. Windows NT and MS-DOS). Platforms that share a VIGUID can be viewed as different versions or releases of a related operating system, e.g. Windows 2000 and Whistler. The choice of "bridging" or not bridging two operating systems via a shared VIGUID must be made based upon upward compatibility and component migration considerations. Objects that are owned by a platform specify this via a PlatformGUID property. This property is polymorphic and may specify either a platform VSGUID or VIGUID. This allows each object to tie itself to a particular version (release) of an operating system or instead to tie to any release that shares the same VIGUID. Typical 3rd party applications will specify a platform VIGUID so that the component is available in all versions of the platform. If an object specifies its owning platform via a VIGUID, then it will be visible in multiple platforms (each platform that uses the same VIGUID). This can cause problems if the object references any other object, and that other object specifies a platform by VSGUID. In this case the referenced object might not be visible in some platforms in which the referee object is visible. For this reason, any object that specifies its owning platform by VIGUID is only allowed to refer to other objects that also specify the owning platform by VIGUID. However, if the object specified its owning platform by VSGUID, then it can refer to other objects that specify their owning platform either by the same VSGUID or the VIGUID of the same platform. The BaseComponentVIGUID property of a platform specifies a component that is designated as the "base" component for this platform. When a new configuration is created for a platform then the base component is automatically instantiated into the configuration. This ensures that a platform-specified minimum set of functionality is always present in all configurations based on that platform. The base instance in the configuration can be identified by the IsBaseComponent property. Note that instantiation of the base component is the responsibility of platform script. The DefaultProtoVIGUID property specifies a component that is designated as the default prototype component for this platform. Any component that does not explicitly specify a prototype component via its PrototypeVIGUID property will implicitly inherit the default prototype component. Since prototype components form a chain, this means that ultimately all components inherit (either directly or indirectly) from the default prototype component. The processing of the prototype component and the component chain is done by the CMI. The LCID property specifies the locale of the platform, and by implication the locale of all components that are part of the platform. In the Mantis architecture different locales are represented by different platforms. The MinVisibility property is used when obtaining a set of Component objects that are owned by the platform. Only those components with a Visibility property greater than or equal to MinVisibility are returned. The MinVisibility property is not persisted. Instead it is initialized to 1000 when a Platform object is created. Platforms always contain script, which is exposed via the ScriptText, ScriptLanguage and ScriptEncoded properties. The script is activated by the CMI in the context of each configuration that is owned by the platform. See Script Model for more information on platform scripts. Constraints The VSGUID of the platform must be unique and not used to name any other object of any other type within the database. The VIGUID of the platform can be reused only in the VIGUID property of other platform objects; it may not be used to name any other object type within the database (even the VSGUID of another platform). Platforms are revisable. Importing a platform with the same VSGUID as another platform causes the incoming platform to overwrite the existing platform if the new platform has a revision that is greater than that of the existing platform. If the incoming platform has a lower revision number then the import of the platform is skipped and a warning is generated. If the incoming platform has an equal revision number then the import of the platform is skipped, but no warning is generated. Platforms are upgradable. Importing a platform does not displace or alter other platforms that have the same VIGUID but a different VSGUID. Importing any other object type into the database when the corresponding owning platform (specified by the PlatformGUID property) is not present is an error. It is permissible for a platform object to be imported into the database before the components referenced by DefaultProtoVIGUID or BaseComponentVIGUID are imported into the database. Platform objects cannot be deleted if any other object references that platform via its PlatformGUID property. If another primary object has a PlatformGUID property that specifies its owner platform by VSGUID, then all other objects that reference that primary object, directly or indirectly, must also specify the same VSGUID as their owning platform. If another primary object has a PlatformGUID property that specifies its owner platform by VIGUID, then all other objects that reference that primary object, directly or indirectly, must specify an owning platform that also has the same VIGUID. PropType Object Object Type Secondary Versioning Parent Objects ResType Child Objects A PropType object represents an individual property type with a resource type.

Description Constraints Repository Object Object Type Primary Versioning Revisable Parent Objects Platform, Group Child Objects Group Contained Objects A Repository object represents the location of an external repository resource that is used as the source of files for the build process. Properties Property Default Meaning (ExtProps) Extended properties. (StdProps) Standard properties. BuildType Integer [A] Bit vector indicating supported build type(s). DateImported TimeDate Time/date when this object was imported into the database. PlatformGUID GUID [A] GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). RepositoryVSGUID GUID [A] Uniquely identifies the repository. Revision Integer [A] Repository revision ordinal. SrcPath String [E] See text Path to repository files (see text). Description Repositories are sets of files that are available for copying to the run-time during the build process. Repository objects are used to specify the source path to these files. The SrcPath property holds the source path for the repository files. This may specify either a folder or a CAB file. If a folder is specified, then files to copy are taken from that folder. If a CAB file is specified then files are taken from the CAB file. In both cases files must be taken directly from the folder or CAB file, and not from any sub-folder. That is, each repository is a flat list of files, not a full tree of files. When the SrcPath property is stored in an SLD file, the path may be either a relative path or an absolute path, though absolute paths are discouraged as they have very limited portability. During import of the SLD file into the component database the CMI will convert a relative path to an absolute path. Therefore, whenever a SrcPath property is referenced within the database it will always contain a fully qualified path. It is also possible to over-ride the SLD SrcPath value and completely replace it with a path specified at import time. Components that wish to copy files do so by referencing a Repository object via the component object's RepositoryVSGUID property. This property refers to a repository either directly (by specifying the VSGUID of a Repository object) or indirectly (by specifying the VSGUID of a RepositorySet group). If the repository is referenced indirectly then the build script must use one or more ambient properties to choose between the different repositories in the group. Typically, this involves matching the BuildType property against that specified for the configuration. Repositories can be members of groups of class RepositorySet and Package. Repository group membership is declared using GROUPMEMBER elements within the REPOSITORY element in the SLD file. Constraints The VSGUID of the repository must be unique and not used to name any other object of any other type within the database. Repositories are revisable. Importing a repository with the same VSGUID as another repository causes the incoming repository to overwrite the existing repository if the new repository has a revision that is greater than that of the existing repository. If the incoming repository has a lower revision number then the import of the repository is skipped and a warning is generated. If the incoming repository has an equal revision number then the import of the repository is skipped, but no warning is generated. The PlatformGUID property must reference an existing Platform object in the database at the time of import. It is permissible for an object to be imported that references a repository via a RepositoryVSGUID property or GROUPMEMBER element before that repository has been imported into the database. It is permissible for a repository to be imported into the database that references groups via one or more GROUPMEMBER elements before that group object has itself been imported into the database.

Description Constraints >>>>> OLD <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Carriers All of the information in a Mantis component database is authored outside of the database. The database is then populated via an import process that imports the pre-authored information into the database, after making various consistency checks on the data. This pre-authored information is prepared in the form of one or more carrier files. Carrier files have a file type of .SLD (pronounced "slide"). Any carrier file can contain any mix of component database data. For example, one carrier file may contain source file information, another may contain component definitions, and another may contain a mix of all database information types. The only Mantis data that are not authored in carrier files are configurations, which are stored as separate XML files (with a file type of .SLX) that are not imported into the database. Mantis does not track carrier files within the component database. Once a carrier file has been imported the "identity" of the carrier file is discarded. This means that it is not possible to delete the result of a previous carrier file import except by manually deleting the individual objects that were imported from the carrier file. The CMI provides a "check carrier" service that validates an entire carrier file, thus allowing the validity of a carrier file to be verified before it is actually imported. TODO We should also always perform a validity check+import as an atomic operation on the database, as otherwise someone could sneak in and alter the DB between the check and the import. We must ensure that either all the carrier file gets in, or none at all. Internally, carrier files are XML files. Each carrier file has a root DCARRIER element containing an arbitrary mix of additional elements that define all of the primary objects in the database. Secondary objects are defined by XML elements within each primary element. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Carrier File --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision="1"> <PLATFORM PlatformVSGUID=" [define platform here] </PLATFORM> <GROUP GroupVSGUID=" [define group here] </GROUP> <GROUP GroupVSGUID=" [define additional group here] </GROUP> <COMPONENT ComponentVSGUID=" [define component here] </COMPONENT> <REPOSITORY RepositoryGUID=" [define repository here] </REPOSITORY> </DCARRIER> XML files are case sensitive. By convention, Mantis uses all upper case for element names and mixed case for attribute names. The DCARRIER element has a single attribute, CarrierRevision, which is used to identify the revision of the carrier file. The value of this element tracks the schema revision of this document (defined in the header on page 1). Inherited Properties All primary objects share a set of common descriptive properties. In a carrier file with many primary objects this leads to a large, redundant, set of property definitions. To assist in creating efficient carrier files, it is recommended that XML entities be used to define properties that are common to all objects. For example, the entity &copyright; can be defined in the internal DTD and then used within each primary object to create a copyright property. Note that the use of XML entities in this way is outside the scope of this document. It is, in fact, simply a side effect of the use of XML as the carrier file format. Constraints Since carrier files are not represented within the database, there are no specific constraints placed upon carriers, except that they are well-formed and valid XML and that the CarrierRevision attribute is 1 (for this revision of the Mantis specification). Resources Almost all Mantis objects support a property bag. This property bag can contain an arbitrary set of properties that are associated with the object. The property set is extensible, and so additional information can be attached to an object without the need to change the underlying Mantis schema. All of the properties in property bags, except as explained here, are unordered properties. That is, they are represented as PROPERTY elements that may have a value (the contents of the element) and a format (the value of the Format attribute). For example: <PROPERTY Name="Info" Format="Integer">100</PROPERTY> All unordered properties are exposed through a property bag, so the above property is accessed as follows: nValue = oSomeObject.Properties.Read("Info") The Mantis architecture also defines a special type of property collection known as a resource. Resources are secondary objects that may be owned by Config, Instance and Component objects. Each Resource object has a corresponding resource type, which defines which properties are present in that resource. In effect, a resource type provides a template for a set of resources. Resource types are themselves primary objects. Thus the Mantis database itself contains the definitions of resource types. Furthermore, this list of types can be augmented with additional types simply by importing additional resource types into the database. Table 6 lists the properties for ResType objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 6: ResType Object Properties (Immutable) Property Default Meaning ResTypeVSGUID Uniquely identifies the resource type (version specific). [A] Revision Integer Resource type revision ordinal. [A] PlatformGUID GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). [A] Resource type name. [A] In addition to the properties listed in table 6, each ResType object contains a list of property types, each defined by a PropType object. Each of these objects defines a single property that may be included in resources of the type specified by the ResType object. Table 7 lists the properties for PropType objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 7: PropType Object Properties Property Default Meaning Property name. [A] Format String Property format. [A] Order Integer Property order. [A] The combination of the ResType and PropType objects fully define the set of properties that must be present within a resource of the corresponding type. Table 8 lists the properties for Resource objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 8: Resource Object Properties Property Default Meaning Names this individual resource. [A] ResTypeVSGUID GUID of the corresponding ResType object. [A] BuildType Integer Build type associated with this resource. [A] Localize Boolean False Resource requires localization. [A] DisplayName Name of the resource (localized). [E] Description Description of the resource (localized). [E] The various resource related objects tie together as follows: Resource objects can be owned by Config, Instance and Component objects. They are therefore secondary objects. Each Resource object has a name, which is specified by the Name property of the object. This name must be unique for each resource owned by a particular object. The name also has a role in component chain collapsing (see below). Each Resource object has a type, which is specified by the ResTypeVSGUID property. This type ties the resource back to the ResType primary object, and allows the type information for the resource to be recovered. The "contents" of the Resource object are zero or more ordered or unordered properties. The ResType object specifies which properties are required by the resource, and also specifies the format of each via a PropType object. The Order attribute of the PropType object specifies if each property is an ordered or unordered property. If this attribute is non-zero, the property is an ordered property, if the attribute is absent or zero, the property is an unordered property. Properties of a Resource object that are listed in the ResType object always have the format specified by the Format attribute of the PropType object. It is not possible to over-ride this format for a particular Resource object. Resource objects may contain additional properties not listed in the corresponding ResType object. All such properties are unordered properties, but may specify an arbitrary format using the Format attribute. If a PropType has non-empty content (value), this value is used as the default value for the property if one is not explicitly specified in the resource. The default value is applied when the Resource object is imported into the database, rather than when the resource is used. If a PropType has an empty content, the property must be present in the corresponding resource. XML Format As with all component database data, ResType and Resource objects are imported within carrier files. Resources are defined using RESOURCE elements, while resource types are defined using RESTYPE elements. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example generic resource --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision ="1"> <RESTYPE     ResTypeVSGUID="{E66B49F6-4A35-4246-87E8-5C1A468315B5}"     Revision="2"     PlatformGUID="{63A6BF93-C0FC-4035-9EE4-806F21722FBC}"     Name="FileHistory"     <PROPTYPE         Name="FileName"         Format="String"         Order="1"     />     <PROPTYPE         Name="FileOwner"         Format="String"         Order="2"     />     <PROPTYPE         Name="Vendor"         Format="String"         Order="3"     >Microsoft</PROPTYPE> </RESTYPE> <COMPONENT          <RESOURCE             Name="FileHistory:1"             ResTypeVSGUID="{E66B49F6-4A35-4246-87E8-5C1A468315B5}"         >             <PROPERTY Name="FileName">foo.exe</PROPERTY>             <PROPERTY Name="FileOwner">jdoe</PROPERTY>             <PROPERTY Name="OtherInfo">blahblah</PROPERTY>         </RESOURCE> </COMPONENT> </DCARRIER> This example shows a Component object that contains a single Resource object. The Resource object is a FileHistory type object, as defined by the single ResType object. This object defines three ordered properties for the type: FileName, FileOwner and Vendor. The Vendor property has a default value. The actual Resource object provides values for the two properties that have no default value (FileName and FileOwner), but omits the Vendor property. In addition, it defines an additional unordered property named OtherInfo. Constraints Platforms The Mantis architecture allows multiple independent logical databases to co-exist within the same physical database. For example, one database might define and generate Windows NT Embedded 4.0 run-time images, while another generates Windows Embedded run-time images. Each logical database is distinguished within the physical database as a distinct platform. Platforms are represented by Platform objects, which are revisable and upgradeable objects. All other object types within the database are explicitly (for primary objects) or implicitly (for secondary objects) tagged with their "owner" platform GUID. These objects are only meaningful within the context of the platform for which they were authored. Using an object in a platform other than the one for which it is authored is forbidden and may have undefined results. Furthermore, each configuration XML file (.SLX file) is also tagged with a platform GUID when it is created. This platform is never changed throughout the lifetime of the configuration it is not possible to "retarget" a configuration by changing its platform. It is also not valid for any of the information in a configuration to refer, directly or indirectly, to database objects that belong to another platform. TODO Target Designer or CMI should validate a configuration at open time to ensure that the instances all refer to components from the correct platform. This will catch any attempts by users to hack the XML directly and reference a "foreign" component. The CMI enforces the strict platform boundaries by filtering all database searches automatically against the platform specified by the currently open Config object. Distinct platforms are typically used to distinguish the following run-time variations: Operating System Each distinct operating system is distinguished by a different platform. CPU Each CPU family (such as X86 or Alpha) is distinguished using a platform. Locale Each language version is distinguished using a platform. This also applies to any "multi-language" versions of an operating system. It is recommended that the DisplayName property of a Platform object describe the platform in the format: Operating System (CPU) - Locale For example, "Windows Embedded (x86)   US English". Because platform locale is distinguished by distinct platforms, creating multiple versions of a run-time for distinct locales will require authoring distinct configurations for each locale. Future versions of Mantis may define tools to assist in the translation of a configuration from one locale to another. However, this process cannot be completely automated since, as a result of the localization process, components in different locales are not automatically interchangeable. Table 5 lists the properties for Platform objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 5: Platform Object Properties Property Default Meaning PlatformVSGUID Uniquely identifies the platform (version specific). [A] PlatformVIGUID Uniquely identifies the platform (version independent). [A] Revision Integer Platform revision ordinal. [A] DefaultProtoVIGUID The default component to use for the prototype for components that do not explicitly define a prototype component. [A] BaseComponentVIGUID The base component that is always included in configurations that are based on this platform. [A] Integer Platform locale. This is the locale ID of the platform, and by extension all of the components and files within the platform. [A] Generation Integer Platform database generation. ScriptText Empty Default configuration script. This script is copied to new configurations when they are created and invoked as part of the CMI logic. [E] ScriptLanguage Empty Identifies the ActiveX scripting engine to be used when processing the configuration script. [A] DateImported Time/date Time/date when this object was imported into the database. The DefaultProtoVIGUID property provides the GUID of the default prototype component as a VIGUID. Any component that does not provide an explicit prototype component in its PrototypeVIGUID property will automatically use the component indicated by the DefaultProtoVIGUID property. For more information on prototype components, see Components below. Note that this must be a VIGUID, not a VSGUID. The BaseComponentVIGUID is the VIGUID of the "starter" component for a configuration. All configurations derived from this platform will automatically have an instance of the specified component added to the configuration when the configuration is first created. This instance cannot be deleted by the user (though it may be configured). For more information see Configurations below. The ScriptText and ScriptLanguage properties define the default (initial) script block that is inherited by new configurations created for this platform. The actual script text is stored in the ScriptText property, and the language of the script is stored in the ScriptLanguage property. Note that the ScriptLanguage property is derived indirectly from the language property of the SCRIPTTEXT XML element in the carrier file. The Generation property contains an ordinal that is incremented each time any change is made to the database that impacts the platform. This includes all import and delete operations that add or remove any objects that are owned by this platform. This allows tools that cache database data to quickly check to see if the data is stale. When an object is imported or deleted that references the platform by its VSGUID, only that platform object is updated with a new Generation value. However, when an object is imported or deleted that references the platform by VIGUID, then all platform objects that share that VIGUID have the Generation property incremented. Platform Versioning Platforms are upgradeable objects. Therefore, as described in Object Versioning above, they are identified by both a PlatformVIGUID and a PlatformVSGUID property. As described above, all other objects in the Mantis database are tagged with the GUID of their owner platform. This GUID may be either the VSGUID or the VIGUID of the platform. That is, the PlatformGUID property of other primary objects is used polymorphically. If an object is tagged with a VSGUID as the owner platform, then the object is tied to a specific version of a platform and is only available (and visible) to configurations based upon that platform. If an object is tagged with a VIGUID as the owner platform, then the object is available to configurations that are based upon any version of the platform. Thus objects can be tied loosely to any version of a platform or tightly to a specific version. This specification does not define the policy for platform versioning. However, it is assumed that major changes to platforms (such as might occur when moving from 32-bit Windows to 64-bit Windows) will be accomplished with distinct platforms, while minor changes (moving from Windows 2000 to Windows 2001) will be accomplished by platform upgrades. Thus, components that are tied to a specific OS version (for example, base OS components or low-level tools such as virus scanners) should be tagged with the VSGUID of the platform, while components that are not version specific (for example, 3rd party apps and drivers) should be tagged with the VIGUID of the platform. XML Format As with all component database data, Platform objects are imported within carrier files. Platforms are defined using PLATFORM elements within the carrier files root DCARRIER element. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Platform --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision ="1"> <PLATFORM PlatformVIGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A822-C711570F145B}" PlatformVSGUID="{63813FD4-2B36-4473-A822-C711570F145B}" Revision="2" DefaultProtoVIGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" BaseComponentVIGUID="{63813FD4-2A37-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" LCID="1027" <SCRIPTTEXT language="vbscript"> <![CDATA[ [put script code here] </SCRIPTTEXT> <DISPLAYNAME> Windows Embedded (x86)   US English </DISPLAYNAME> </PLATFORM> </DCARRIER> Constraints Except where noted below, importing a Platform object with a VSGUID that matches any other primary object GUID in the database is a severe error. When importing a Platform object, either the VIGUID of the platform must not exist in the database, or it must be the VIGUID of one or more other Platform objects. Importing a new platform (new VSGUID) sets the Generation property to 1 for the new platform. All other platforms in the database that share the same VIGUID as the new platform have their Generation properties incremented. Importing a platform that is identical to an existing platform (same VSGUID, same revision, same properties) is a null operation and can be silently skipped. Importing a platform that has the same VSGUID and revision as an existing platform but has different properties results in a severe error. Importing a platform that is an older revision of a platform already in the database (same VSGUID, lower revision) results in a warning, and the platform is not imported. Importing a platform that is a newer revision then a platform already in the database (same VSGUID, higher revision) overwrites the old platform with the newer revision. The Generation property for the new revision is set to one greater than the generation number for the platform being over-written. All other platforms in the database that share the same VIGUID as the new platform also have their Generation properties incremented. Repositories One of the main tasks of the run-time image build process is copying the files that comprise the bulk of the run-time image. All of these files come from one or more repositories. Although the files that comprise a repository are stored outside of the database, each repository is represented by a Repository object. Repository objects are immutable objects. Repositories can be stored in two forms: as a folder or as a CAB file. A folder repository is comprised of the files that are present in the specified folder, but not the files present in any sub-folders (that is, repositories are "flat" folders, not trees). A CAB repository is comprised of the files that are present in a CAB file. Like folder repositories, only the files in the root folder within the CAB file are considered part of the repository. Restricting repository files to flat folders or CAB files means that files that are sourced in a folder tree must have a Repository object for each folder in the tree. The rationale for this restriction is to avoid the need to place relative path information within File objects. If repositories were folder trees, each File object would need to specify a relative path to the source file. This, in turn, complicates the repository and component authoring process when the final arrangement of files in the repository is not yet known. Table 6 lists the properties for Repository objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 6: Repository Object Properties Property Default Meaning RepositoryVSGUID Uniquely identifies the repository. [A] Revision Integer Repository revision ordinal. [A] PlatformGUID GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). [A] SrcPath See text Path to repository files (see below). [E] Checked Boolean False True for checked (debug) repository, False for free (non-debug) repository. [A] FilesCopied Boolean True if files were copied when carrier was imported. False if files are referenced "in place" (see below). DateImported Time/date Time/date when this object was imported into the database. The SrcPath property specifies the source location to use when copying files from this repository. This property should specify either a folder (for a folder repository) or the path to a CAB file (for a CAB repository). When present in a carrier file (as XML), the SrcPath property must specify a relative path. This path is always assumed to be relative to the folder that contains the carrier file. The default value for this relative path is ".", so the default source location for the repository files is the same folder as the carrier file. Notwithstanding the above, to facilitate testing, the CMI must support the use of absolute path names for the SrcPath property in the XML carrier file. When present in the database, the SrcPath property specifies an absolute path (which may be a UNC path), either to a folder or a CAB file. Thus, during import, the CMI will resolve the relative path and store the resulting absolute path instead. The use of CAB files or folders, and the SrcPath property, allow for several different repository distribution schemes: A carrier file contains a Repository object defined without a SrcPath property. In this case the default path of "." is assumed and the repository files are therefore in the same folder as the carrier file itself. A carrier file contains a Repository object defined with a SrcPath property that specifies a relative folder path. In this case the repository files will be present in a sub-folder below the folder containing the carrier file. A carrier file contains a Repository object defined with a SrcPath property that specifies a CAB file without a path. In this case the repository files will be present in the CAB file, which will itself be present in the same folder as the carrier file. A carrier file contains a Repository object defined with a SrcPath property that specifies a CAB file with a relative path. In this case the repository files will be present in the CAB file, which will itself be present in a sub-folder below the folder containing the carrier file. A carrier file is itself contained within a CAB file, and the Repository object is defined without a SrcPath property. In this case the repository files will be present in the CAB file with the carrier file. Additional variations are possible. Note that the ImportCarrier service of the CMI object must support the last variant described above by providing an additional parameter that specifies the source CAB file. When a Repository object is imported into the database, the source files referenced by the object (i.e. either a folder or a CAB file) may either be referenced in-place or copied to a new location and then used at that new location. In-place reference is appropriate when the repository source is permanently available, such as a local hard disk or a network share. Copying is appropriate when the source is on temporarily accessible storage. For CDROM based repositories, it may be appropriate to copy the repository files in some circumstances, and not in others (for example, the main operating system repository may be left on the CDROM, while other subsidiary repositories are copied to a local hard disk). The ImportCarrier service of the CMI object can automatically copy the repository files if requested to do so. If this feature is requested, the FilesCopied property is automatically set to True for the Repository object. Otherwise, the FilesCopied property is set to False. Note that this facility is handled at the carrier file level, and will thus apply to all the repositories defined within that file. Also, since the complete list of files that comprise the repository is not available, the service always copies all the files in the specified repository folder (if the source is a folder and not a CAB file). A repository is considered unique based upon the combination of the repository GUID and the Checked property. Thus, two repositories may share the same GUID if they have different values for the Checked property. This feature is used to manage the selection of free/checked files during the build process. When a checked repository is created, it should always have the same GUID as the free version of the same repository, but should have the Checked property set to True. The CMI will then use this information to choose the correct repository when copying files. If repository files are copied during carrier file import, they are always copied to a folder with a name that is the same as the GUID of the Repository object, modified according to the Checked property. If the Checked property is False, the folder name is modified with the ".fre" suffix. If the Checked property is True, the folder name is modified with the ".chk" suffix. Thus, if the ImportCarrier service is provided with a destination folder of C:\Foo, and the carrier file contains two repositories having GUIDs of X and Y, and X is a free repository while Y is a checked repository, the files for repository X will be placed in the C:\Foo\X.fre folder and those for Repository Y will be placed in the C:\Foo\Y.chk folder. Once the copy is complete the SrcPath property in the database will point to this folder. It is expected that the UI tools will manage a default location for repository imports, so that all copied repositories are stored in folders as described above under a single, shared, folder. When a Repository object is deleted from the database, the folder and contents specified by the SrcPath property are also deleted if the FilesCopied property is True. Note that this will delete any sub-folders in this folder, but these should not exist anyway, since the ImportCarrier service will never create sub-folders below a repository folder. Occasionally, the files that comprise a repository may change location. This can happen, for example, if a drive letter is changed, or if a UNC path to a network share is altered. There may also sometimes be a need to move repository files to a new location (for example, to reorganize disk space usage). The MoveSource service of the Repository object provides the means to handle this situation. The MoveSource service processes two types of move requests: A move request, where the repository files have not yet been moved. In this case the service physically moves the files to the new location. This variant is only valid if the FilesCopied property for the repository is True. A rebase request, where the repository files have already been relocated. In this case the service simply updates the SrcPath property. This variant is valid regardless of the FilesCopied property. Note that the MoveSource service does not alter the value of the FilesCopied property. Removable Media Repositories may reside on removable media. If the repository is small it will typically be copied to other (non-removable) media when it is imported. If the repository is large it may be desirable to access the repository directly from the media. In this case, the system must check that the correct media is inserted before attempting to access the files in the repository. To do this, the system can simply check for the presence of the repository folder or CAB file in the appropriate location (SrcPath). If the file is not present and the media is not removable, a fatal error is indicated. If the media is removable, the user should be prompted to insert the correct media. The prompt can be "smart" and use the friendly name of the repository and/or file desired. One implication of this scheme is that file copy operations during build will be optimal if the copy order is sorted so that media insertions are minimized. However, this reordering is complicated by the constraints of component dependencies. The build section describes an optimal file copying process. XML Format As with all component database data, Repository objects are imported within carrier files. Repositories are defined using REPOSITORY elements within the carrier files root DCARRIER element. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Repository --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision ="1"> <REPOSITORY RepositoryVSGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A824-C711570F145B}" PlatformGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" Revision="7" SrcPath=".\Foo" </DCARRIER> Constraints Except where noted below, importing a Repository object with a VSGUID that matches any other primary object GUID in the database is a severe error. Importing a repository that is identical to an existing repository (same VSGUID, same revision, same properties) is a null operation and can be silently skipped. Two repositories with the same VSGUID may co-exist in the database only if they have different values for the Checked property. Importing a repository that has the same VSGUID and revision as an existing repository but has different properties results in a severe error. Importing a repository that has the same VSGUID but a different revision to an existing repository results in a severe error. Groups Groups are used to collect components into sets. Each Group object defines a group, and contains the usual properties for a primary object (GUID, revision, name etc). Each component then identifies the groups to which it belongs by listing group GUIDs. There is no limit to the number of groups, or the number of groups to which each component can belong. Group object are revisable objects. Table 7 lists the properties for Group objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 7: Group Object Properties Property Default Meaning GroupVSGUID Uniquely identifies the group (version specific). [A] Revision Integer Group revision ordinal. [A] PlatformGUID GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). [A] GroupClass Integer Group class. See table 8. [A] DefaultDependencyType Integer Default dependency type for class 3 groups only. [A] DateImported Time/date Time/date when this object was imported into the database. The GroupClass property defines the class of the group. Group class values and their meanings are shown in table 8. Table 8: Group Class Values Value Meaning GroupClassNone Not valid. GroupClassPackage Package group. GroupClassCategory Category group. GroupClassDependency Dependency group. Package Groups Package groups are used to organize components into groups so that certain operations can be performed en masse. For example, the DeleteComponent service permits a package group GUID to be specified instead of a component GUID. In this case, the service will delete all components that are members of that group. An example of a package group might be a Windows NT Service Pack. All of the components that comprise the service pack can be marked as members of a Service Pack group. Package groups are also used to manage automatic configuration upgrades. When a component is added to a configuration (by a process known as instantiation), the component identity is stored in the configuration using a VSGUID, thus "locking" the configuration to a specific version of the component. As new versions of a component are added to the database it may become desirable to upgrade the configuration to use these components. This can be done on a component-by-component basis, but is more easily managed on a group basis. Thus it is possible to request a "bulk upgrade" of a configuration to (say) Service Pack 6. To do this, the CMI first correlates the VIGUID of each instance against the VIGUIDs of the SP6 components. For each match, the instance is upgraded to the SP6 version of the component. For more information on instance upgrading, refer to Components and Instances below. Category Groups Category groups are used to break the full set of components present in a platform into smaller sets for the purposes of UI display. There are actually no semantics within the CMI associated with category groups they are available entirely for the use of the UI tools. It is expected that the UI tools will display a list of components broken down by category, and thus a category group is analogous to a file folder on disk. However, unlike file folders, a component can belong to any number of category groups, and this allows the component to appear in more than one category (which is useful if a component straddles two category definitions). The categorization of components is beyond the scope of this specification. However, it is recommended that the DisplayName property of the category group be viewed as a simple "category path" that provides a main category and a series of sub-categories, each separated by colon characters. For example: Drivers : Networking : Network Adapters If this convention is adopted, the UI tools may choose to display the category list as a flat list or a simple category tree. Notice that for readability spaces are placed either side of the colon characters. UI tools that wish to display the category namespace as a tree should strip these spaces when processing the category names. Dependency Groups Dependency groups are used to indirectly specify inter-component dependencies. A "direct" dependency is used when one component specifies directly that it is dependent upon another (by GUID). An "indirect" dependency is used when one component specifies that it is dependent upon a dependency group. In this case the dependency is interpreted as meaning that the component is dependent upon all of the components that are members of that group. Components that specify group dependencies may specify a dependency "type" or they may instead take that type information from the group itself. If they choose the latter alternative, the type information comes from the DefaultDependencyType property of the group. For more information on dependencies and groups, see Dependencies below. XML Format As with all component database data, Group objects are imported within carrier files. Groups are defined using GROUP elements within the carrier files root DCARRIER element. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Group --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision ="1"> <GROUP GroupVSGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A824-C711570F145B}" PlatformGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" Revision="7" GroupClass="2" <DISPLAYNAME> Drivers : Display : Matrox </DISPLAYNAME> </GROUP> </DCARRIER> Constraints Except where noted below, importing a Group object with a VSGUID that matches any other primary object GUID in the database is a severe error. Importing a group that is identical to an existing group (same VSGUID, same revision, same properties) is a null operation and can be silently skipped. Importing a group that has the same VSGUID and revision as an existing group but has different properties results in a severe error. Importing a group that is an older revision of a group already in the database (same VSGUID, lower revision) results in a warning, and the group is not imported. Importing a group that is a newer revision than a group already in the database (same VSGUID, higher revision) overwrites the old group with the newer revision. Components The core of Mantis is the component. Many components describe operating system functionality, such as services and device drivers, but components are also used to describe 3rd party software. The features of a run-time image generated by Mantis are controlled entirely by which components (or, more correctly, component instances) are included in the run-time configuration. Component objects are revisable and upgradable primary objects. A component is comprised of the following items of information: A normal set of component properties. A list of groups to which the component belongs. A list of files that will be copied to the run-time image when the component is built. A list of registry keys and values that will be created in the run-time image registry when the component is built. A block of script that is used by the component instance. A block of HTML that is used when configuring the component instance data. A list of dependencies that specify inter-component relationships. A component is built into a run-time image by being included as part of a configuration. Adding a component to a configuration creates a component instance, (or just instance). An instance is an editable copy of the component state, and also contains a reference back to the component for additional non-editable information. For more information on instances, see Instances below. Component Properties Table 9 lists the properties for Component objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 9: Component Object Properties Property Default Meaning ComponentVSGUID Uniquely identifies the component (version specific). [A] ComponentVIGUID Uniquely identifies the component (version independent). [A] Revision Integer Platform revision ordinal. [A] PlatformGUID GUID of the owning platform (either a VSGUID or a VIGUID). [A] PrototypeVIGUID Empty Optional prototype component VIGUID. If empty, the default prototype specified by the platform is used. [A] RepositoryVSGUID Repository to use as source of all files. [A] Visibility Integer Component visibility level. [A] MultiInstance Boolean False Component can be instantiated multiple times in the same configuration. [A] Released Boolean If False, the component is not fully authored, and is still pre-release. [A] Editable Boolean If False, component is not configurable by the user. [A] ScriptText Empty Component configuration script. [E] ScriptLanguage Empty Identifies the ActiveX scripting engine to be used when processing the script. [A] HTMLText Empty HTML to be used when configuring this component. [E] HelpContext Empty Context sensitive help data for this component. [E] DateImported Time/date Time/date when this object was imported into the database. The PrototypeVIGUID property specifies the GUID of a component that is to be used as the prototype for this component. For more information on prototypes, see Instances below. If this property is empty, the default prototype GUID specified by the platform is used. The RepositoryVSGUID property specifies the GUID of the repository object that will be used as the source of all files for this component. Individual files are specified by secondary File objects that are part of the Component object (see below). All these file objects obtain files from the repository specified by this property. The Visibility property controls the visibility of the component to the UI tools. This property defines a visibility "level", which defaults to 1000. Components may be filtered based upon their visibility level, with only those components that have a visibility greater than a specified threshold displayed. Components that should never be displayed to the user should have a visibility of 0. Components that should always be visible should have a visibility of 32767. TODO Define visibility policies and scenarios for component authors and UI tool authors. The MultiInstance property controls component instancing within a configuration. If this property is False, only one instance of this component is allowed in a configuration. If this property is True, more than one instance of this component is allowed. The Released property is used internally by Microsoft to track internal component authoring processes. This property must be set to True on all components prior to a general release of the component database. The Editable property controls the editing of all instances of the component. If this property is False, the component is not configurable by the user. Otherwise, the component may be configured. The ScriptText and ScriptLanguage properties specify a block of script code that is executed in response to various instance events. Typically the values for these properties are inherited using the prototype inheritance mechanism described below. For more information, see Instances below. The HTMLText property contains a block of HTML code that is used when editing an instance of this component. For more information, see Instances below. Note that this property does not need to be present for a component to be edited. If the Editable property is True an the HTMLText property is empty the CMI will synthesize a default HTML script to edit the component. The HelpContext property contains help context information for use by the UI tools. TODO We need to resolve how help for components gets installed. Where does the help file come from? Where is it stored? Some of this can be resolved at the UI level, but we do need to manage some issues as this will occur during component import. Component Versioning Component objects are revisable and upgradable objects. This means that it is permissible for multiple versions of the "same" component to co-exist within the database (see Object Versioning above for more information). It is important to understand how the UI tools will use this information when working with components. From a UI perspective, the following operations are expected: When a user instantiates a component, he/she will be able to choose either a specific version, or the "most recent" version (the default). When a component is instantiated the VSGUID of the component is recorded in the configuration. Individual component instances can be updated to specific versions or the most recent version by simply presenting the user with a list of possible versions (and "most recent"). Bulk updates of component instances in a configuration are also possible. In this case, the user can select a package group, and all the component instances in that package group are then updated to the specific versions of the components in that package. In order to avoid difficulties when components are distributed in multiple vehicles, the following rules should be obeyed when altering a component: A component may be revised only when the changes do not involve any changes that affect the run-time image built by that component. A component is upgraded whenever changes are made that affect the run-time image built by that component. For example, if a component is duplicated into a new repository, and the exact same binary source files are used, then the only change to the component is a new RepositoryVSGUID property. This is a component revision only. However, if newer binary source files are used, then this is a component upgrade. This policy can cause unexpected side effects if components are deleted from the database. For example, assume the database contains a component Foo. An upgraded version of Foo is shipped as part of SP4. Later, SP5 is shipped, but the Foo component is unaltered. This means that the SP5 version of Foo will be a revision of the SP4 version, not an upgrade. If SP4 is added to the database, the database will contain two versions of Foo: the original and the SP4 version. If SP5 is then added, the SP5 version will be seen as a new revision and will replace the SP4 version. Thus there will still only be two versions of Foo: the original and the SP5 version. If SP5 is removed, it might be expected by the user that the SP4 version will re-appear. However, all that is left is the original (pre-SP4) version of Foo. Thus adding and removing SP5 will have the side effect of removing the SP4 version. Effects such as these are one reason why deletions from the component database are strongly discouraged. Group Membership Components can be members of any number of groups of any class, in any combination. To indicate group membership, a component lists the GUIDs for each group of which it is a member. This list is expressed as zero or more GROUPMEMBER XML elements in a carrier. Note that the Mantis object model does not expose group memberships directly (i.e. there is no GroupMember object). Instead, each Component object exposes an implied Groups collection. Files Each component contains a list of files that will be copied during the build process. Each file is represented as a secondary File object that specifies the source and destination of the file. Table 10 lists the properties for File objects. File objects are expressed as XML FILE elements in carrier files. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 10: File Object Properties Property Default Meaning SrcPath Empty Source path for file. May be folder or CAB file. [E] SrcName Source file name. [E] SrcFileSize Integer If non-zero, size of source file. If the source file is compressed, this is the size of the file as stored in compressed form. [A] SrcFileCRC Integer If non-zero, CRC of source file. If the source file is compressed, this is the CRC of the file as stored in compressed form. [A] DstPath Destination path for file. May be folder or CAB file. [E] DstName See text Destination name for file (not path). If empty, same as the SrcName property. [E] NoExpand Boolean False If True and the source file is compressed, it is not expanded when copied. Otherwise if the file is compressed it is expanded. [A] DisplayName Empty Optional name of file for UI display. [E] Description Empty Optional description of file for UI tooltip. [E] The File object defines a SrcPath property. However, this property is not used by File objects that are owned by Component objects, and this property should always be empty. The source information for each file is specified by a combination of the SrcName property of the File object and the RepositoryVSGUID of the parent Component object. The repository supplies the actual path to the source file (which may reside in a folder or a CAB file). To assist in file verification and detection of viruses etc. the SrcFileSize property specifies the size of the source file, and the SrcFileCRC specifies a 16-bit CRC for the source file. Both these properties operate on the raw source file if the file is compressed they are computer relative to the compressed form of the file. If these properties are zero, then this implies that the size and/or CRC are not specified. TODO Choose and specify generator polymonial for the CRC. The DstPath property specifies the destination for the file. This may be either a folder or a .CAB file. Allowing .CAB files here allows components to construct .CAB archives in the run-time image. Note that the source of the file as specified by the repository may also be a .CAB file, however there is no correlation between using a .CAB file source and specifying a .CAB file destination. The DstName property specifies the destination file name. If absent, the SrcName property is used. The NoExpand property controls file expansion. If the file is not compressed this field is ignored. If the field is False and the file is compressed, the file is expanded during the copy operation. If the field is True the file is copied without expansion (i.e. straight binary copy). This property controls the expansion of files that were compressed using the older Microsoft COMPRESS program, and which typically have a file extension that ends in an underscore character. Registry Keys In addition to a list of files, each component also specifies a list of registry keys and values that are installed during the build of the component. Each registry key entry is represented as a secondary RegKey object that specifies the registry key or value to set. Table 11 lists the properties for RegKey objects. RegKey objects are expressed as XML REGKEY elements in carrier files. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 11: RegKey Object Properties Property Default Meaning KeyPath Full path to registry key. [E] ValueName Empty Name of value, or empty for default key value. [E] Integer Registry key type (from WIN32 API). [A] Integer Size of registry data, in bytes. [A] RegValue Binary Actual registry data value. [E] DisplayName Empty Optional name of registry key for UI display. [E] Description Empty Optional description of key for UI tooltip. [E] TODO: Need to describe individual types and representation of binary data. Also need to add fields to define: interactive editing, non-destructive writes. TODO Details of edit (interactive config) fields and non-destructive registry editing. Dependencies Components define system functionality. They do not, however, exist in isolation. Most components require the services of other components to perform their tasks. This relationship is expressed as a dependency relationship between components. The Mantis architecture exposes a rich dependency model that allows complex inter-component relationships to be described. These relationships ensure that adequate support is available in a run-time image for the selected components, and that the run-time image is constructed in the correct order. The Mantis dependency model is described in the document Mantis Component Dependency Model. This document also describes a simple grammar to express the various dependency flavors. Registry dependencies are not explicitly specified by components. Instead, these dependencies are derived by the CMI on the fly when a build process or dependency check is initiated. A registry dependency is deduced by the CMI when a component X performs a non-destructive edit of a registry key and a component Y performs a destructive write to the same registry key. In this case the CMI assumes the dependency X *->> Y. Each dependency is represented as a secondary Dependency object that specifies the dependency information. Table 12 lists the properties for Dependency objects. Dependency objects are expressed as XML DEPENDENCY elements in carrier files. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 12: Dependency Object Properties Property Default Meaning Class Integer Dependency class (default is Include). [A] Integer Dependency type (default is All). [A] DependOnGUID Dependency target GUID. Either a component VIGUID or a dependency group VSGUID. [A] MinRevision Integer If non-zero, specifies the minimum required revision number of the target component or components. [A] DisplayName Empty Optional name of file for UI display. [E] Description Empty Optional description of file for UI tooltip. [E] The meanings and values of the Class, Type and MinRevision properties are described in the Mantis Component Dependency Model document. The DependOnGUID property specifies the target of the dependency. This can either be a component, in which case this is the VIGUID of the component (not the VSGUID) or it can be a dependency group (but not a package or category group), in which case this is the VSGUID of the group. Raw Dependencies During the configuration authoring process, the UI tools and Mantis use dependency information to ensure that all required components are included in the runtime image. However, during the component authoring process, it is possible that some dependencies may need to be expressed before the required target components have been created. This is particularly true when authoring a complex set of inter-related components, where the exact boundaries of individual components may not be clear. To assist in this situation, dependencies can be expressed in "raw" form in the database. Raw dependencies are a temporary assist for component authoring. During the final stages of component authoring all raw dependencies should be converted to normal dependencies. The UI tools and Mantis system does not actually use the raw dependency data (though other tools may do so). It is merely present as an authoring aid and cross-reference checker. Therefore in a fully authored and coherent component database raw dependencies are not required. A raw dependency declares that a component is dependent upon a resource that is external to that component. Table 13 lists the various resource types that can be expressed in a raw dependency. Table 13: Raw Dependency Types Value Meaning Undefined type (not valid). RawCLSID Dependency is the CLSID of a COM server. RawFile Dependency is the name (not path) of a file. RawRegKey Dependency is the full path of a registry key. Regardless of the raw dependency type, the dependency expressed is always an include dependency build dependencies cannot be specified in raw form. In effect, a raw dependency specifies that the component is dependent upon whatever other component "owns" the resource that is expressed in the dependency. Raw dependencies are specified as RAWDEP elements in SLD files, with a single Type attribute that specifies the type of the dependency. The element content specifies the value of the dependency (e.g. the file name). For example: <RAWDEP Type="RawFile">foo.exe</RAWDEP> Editing and Configuration TODO HTML based editing and linkage to/from properties and regkeys for instances. This is distinct from regkey non-dest editing during build!!! XML Format As with all component database data, Component objects are imported within carrier files. Components are defined using COMPONENT elements within the carrier files root DCARRIER element. Each COMPONENT element contains additional FILE, REGKEY, DEPENDENCY and GROUPMEMBER elements to define the secondary objects in the component. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Group --> <DCARRIER CarrierRevision ="1"> <COMPONENT ComponentVSGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A824-C711570F145B}" ComponentVIGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4474-A824-C711570F145B}" PlatformGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" Revision="23" Visibility="1200" MultiInstance="0" Released="1" <SCRIPTTEXT language="vbscript"> <![CDATA[ [put script code here] </SCRIPTTEXT> <DISPLAYNAME> Example Component </DISPLAYNAME> <FILE SrcFileSize="14500" NoExpand="1" <SRCNAME>Foo.exe</SRCNAME> <DSTPATH>[[windir]]\system</DSTPATH> </FILE> <GROUPMEMBER GroupVSGUID="{63813FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" <REGKEY Type="REG_DWORD" Size="4" <KEYPATH>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Foo</KEYPATH> <VALUENAME>Width</VALUENAME> <REGVALUE>900</REGVALUE> </REGKEY> <DEPENDENCY Class="Include" Type="AtLeastOne" DependOnGUID="{63413FD4-2A36-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" <RAWDEP Type="RawFile">foo.exe</RAWDEP> </COMPONENT> </DCARRIER> Constraints Configurations A configuration is the set of data that fully describes a specific run-time image for a platform. Configurations are stored outside of the component database as XML files with a file extension of .SLX. Authoring and editing a run-time image is actually achieved by authoring and editing a configuration. Once the configuration is complete, a build process (described below) uses the information in the configuration to generate the actual run-time image. Configurations are closely tied to platforms. Each configuration is authored against a specific platform, which is chosen when the configuration is created. The choice of platforms then defines the type of run-time image that the configuration can generate, and also (by implication) which components can be included in the run-time image. A configuration is comprised of the following items of information: A set of configuration properties. A list of configuration level files that will be copied to the run-time image when the configuration is built. A list of configuration level registry keys that will be created in the run-time image registry when the configuration is built. A block of script that is obtained from the platform definition. A list of component instances that define individual components that have been included in the configuration. Table 14 lists the properties for Config objects. Properties marked [A] are attribute properties, while properties marked [E] are element properties. Unmarked properties are not expressed in the XML carrier file (.SLD file) and are only present within the Mantis database. Table 14: Config Object Properties Property Default Meaning Revision Integer Configuration revision ordinal. [A] PlatformVSGUID GUID of the owning platform. This is always a VSGUID. [A] Generation Integer Generation ordinal from platform at time of last update. [A] Checked Boolean False True for checked (debug) build, False for free (non-debug) build. [A] ScriptText Empty Configuration script. Copied from Platform object when configuration is created and invoked as part of the CMI logic. [E] ScriptLanguage Empty Identifies the ActiveX scripting engine to be used when processing the configuration script. [A] BuildPath C:\OSIMAGE Target path for run-time image build. [E] WinPath C:\WINNT Virtual path for Windows directory on target platform. [E] BootDrive Virtual boot drive. The Revision property is incremented each time the configuration is edited or updated in any way. When a platform is created this property is initially set to 1. The PlatformVSGUID property specifies the platform for this configuration. The CMI will not open configurations that specify a non-existent platform. Note that, unlike most other object, this is a VSGUID, and thus the configuration is tied to a specific version of a platform. The Generation property is updated each time the configuration is saved, and is set to the corresponding value from the appropriate platform object (as specified by the PlatformVSGUID property). When a configuration is opened, if the Generation property of the platform and the configuration are different (either less than or greater than), then it must be assumed that any cached data in the configuration is stale, and this data must be refreshed from the database as necessary. Note that it is possible for the generation of the platform to be less than the configuration if the platform object was deleted and restored after the previous configuration update. The Checked property selects between a free (non-debug) or checked (debug) build. A free build (when Checked is False) generates a regular retail version of the run-time, while a checked build (when Checked is True) generates a checked/debug version. The ScriptText and ScriptLanguage properties are set from the corresponding properties of the platform object when the configuration is created. This script is used during certain configuration processes, such as the build process. The BuildPath property specifies the target build path to be used when building the run-time image. This is the temporary location into which the run-time files are copied, and is not related to the final execution location where the run-time resides and from which it will eventually boot. The WinPath and BootDrive properties specify the location on the final target hardware of the system boot drive and the system root directory. These are virtual properties in that they refer to locations that will eventually exist on the target hardware. Creating New Configurations New configurations are created by the NewConfig service of the CMI. This service creates a Config object, which may later be persisted into an .SLX file. When a new configuration is created, the properties of the configuration are initialized as follows: The Revision property is set to 1. The PlatformVSGUID property is set to the VSGUID of the platform that is selected by the user (and passed as a parameter to the NewConfig service). The Generation property is set to the value of the Generation property in the platform object. The Checked property is set to False. All configurations default to free builds when they are created. This property can later be changed by the UI tools as required. The ScriptText and ScriptLanguage properties are copied from the corresponding properties in the platform object, as described above. The BuildPath, WinPath and BootDrive properties are set to the values passed as  parameters to the NewConfig service. If it exists, the OnNewConfig procedure in the configuration script is triggered. The component specified by the BaseComponentVIGUID in the platform object is instantiated as the first component in the configuration. This will trigger an OnNewInstance procedure invocation in the configuration script. The final step "seeds" the configuration with a starter component. This component, which is specified by the platform for all configurations that are based on that platform, acts as a base component for the configuration. This component normally only contains a set of dependencies, and thus ensures that all configurations based upon a particular platform will have a minimum set of components before passing a dependency check. The root component can never be multi-instance, and is always hidden, though it may on occasions be editable. The root component instance is always assigned the special instance ID of  1 (see Instances below). Configuration File List TODO: make like component file with extended properties Configuration RegKey List TODO: ditto XML Format Configurations are stored in XML files with a file extension of .SLX. A configuration consists of a single CONFIGURATION element that is stored within an XCARRIER element. This element may then contain any number of PROPERTY, FILE, REGKEY and INSTANCE elements. For example: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE DCARRIER SYSTEM "file:mantis.dtd"> <!-- Example Configuration --> <XCARRIER CarrierRevision="1"> <CONFIG Revision="14" PlatformVSGUID="{63813FD4-2A33-4473-A823-C711570F145B}" Generation="11" <SCRIPTTEXT language="vbscript"> <![CDATA[ [put script code here] </SCRIPTTEXT> <BUILDPATH>c:\temp\ntimages</BUILDPATH> <DISPLAYNAME> Example Configuration </DISPLAYNAME> <FILE SrcFileSize="14500" NoExpand="1" <SRCPATH>e:\binfiles</SRCPATH> <SRCNAME>foo.exe</SRCNAME> <DSTPATH>[[windir]]\system</DSTPATH> </FILE> <INSTANCE> [put instance data here] </INSTANCE> </CONFIG> </XCARRIER> Constraints Configuration Scripting Config objects are active objects. That is, the object contains script that is activated by the CMI in response to specific actions. Many of the operations associated with a Config object are in fact handled by the script in the object, rather than by code wired directly into the CMI. The script code is expressed in the ScriptText property of the Config object. This property is initially populated from the corresponding property of the Platform object when the configuration is first created. Thus the source for all configuration script is the platform for that configuration. The CMI supports configuration scripting via the standard ActiveX scripting interfaces. Therefore, the script text can be in any language supported by ActiveX scripting, though VBScript is recommended. The language is specified by the ScriptLanguage property, which is used to locate and load the appropriate ActiveX script engine. The script is loaded and a script site created when the Config object is created. Therefore, any global statements in the script will execute once when the Config object is created. The script site is destroyed when the Config object is destroyed. The CMI makes a single global object available in the script namespace. This object, named Self, is identical to the Config object from which the script was derived. This provides the script with access to all the properties and methods of the Config object, and also via this object to other objects in the Mantis object mode. For example, the CMI object can be accessed via the Self.CMI property. Apart from global script statements, which execute when the Config object is created, the CMI invokes procedures within the script when certain operations occur. Table 15 lists these procedures. Note that all script procedures are optional. If a script procedures is not present, the CMI will take a default action. Table 15: Configuration Script Procedures Procedure Usage OnInitConfig Invoked when Config object created. Always invoked before any other procedures. OnNewConfig Invoked when configuration created using Platform.NewConfig service. OnOpenConfig Invoked when existing configuration is reopened via Platform.OpenConfig service. OnSaveConfig Invoked when configuration is saved via Config.Save or Config.SaveAs services. OnCloseConfig Invoked when Config object is being closed. OnAddFile Invoked when a new File object is added to a configuration. OnAddInstance Invoked when a new Instance object is added to a configuration. OnAddRegKey Invoked when a new RegKey object is added to a configuration. OnDeleteFile Invoked when a File object is deleted from a configuration. OnDeleteInstance Invoked when an Instance object is deleted from a configuration. OnDeleteRegKey Invoked when a RegKey object is deleted from a configuration. OnCheckDepends Invoked when the Config.CheckDepends service is used. OnBuildRuntime Invoked multiple times during the build process initiated by the Config.BuildRuntime service. Instances Instance ref counting and "soft" vs "hard" inclusions so we know when to delete soft includes. Multi-instancing. Explain instancing and prototypes. Special: "ScriptXXX" properties are not inherited in the normal way, so we can access all the script blocks.. THIS IS A SPECIAL CASE. "Instance chain" of components concept. XML Format Constraints Instance Scripting Build Processing Optimal file copy process for minimal repository swapping. The build process in Mantis is responsible for the generation of a run-time image. The input to this process is a configuration and the component database. Builds in Mantis are batch driven and non-interactive so that they may be easily automated. The CMI provides the backbone model for the build process, but all the OS specific logic for the build is embodied within script in components. This effectively decouples the Mantis architecture from the OS platform and allows the same architecture to build many different platforms, even from the same database. The actual build process is multi-phase. The phases of the build are as follows: Dependency graph checking. Prebuild: Run tool-level and configuration-level prebuild script. Resolve dependency tree. Destructive registry key phase (component level). Resolve dependency tree. Non-destructive registry key phase (component level). Destructive registry key phase (configuration level). Non-destructive registry key phase (configuration level). Resolve dependency tree. Copy files (component level). Copy files (configuration level). Postbuild: Run configuration level and tool-level postbuild script. >>> Where is script involved. >>>File conflict resolution rules (versioning etc.) >>>Reg conflict resolution rules. >>>Build order: soft and hard dependencies. >>two phase registry editing. File Copy Phase Ideal process: Traverse component tree to build list of files to be copied in dependency order. Add configuration level list of files. Scan list for duplicate files (same name, same destination). Eliminate earlier files in that list, so over-writes will not occur. Reorder list so files from each repository are copied as a single group. Copy the files.

Creating Windows NT Setup Startup Disks
=======================================================================

If your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server Setup floppy disks 
become corrupted, or are misplaced, you can create a new set by using
Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe from your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT
Server compact disc. These disks can be used to start Windows NT Workstation
or Windows NT Server Setup, or can be used with your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Note
You can create these boot disks from a computer running MS-DOS, Windows
version 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation, or
Windows NT Server.

To create Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server startup disks:

     1. Insert the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc
        into a CD-ROM drive.
     2. From the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive and the
        correct platform folder (for example, \I386 for x86-based
        computers).
     3. If the computer you are using is running Windows NT, type:

        winnt32 /ox

        at the command prompt, press Enter, and follow the instructions.

If the computer you are using is running MS-DOS or Windows version 3.1,
Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95, type winnt /ox at the command prompt,
press Enter, and follow the instructions.


El Torito (No Emulation) Bootable CD-ROM Format
=======================================================================

If your computer's BIOS does not support the El Torito (no emulation)
bootable CD-ROM format, you might get an error when you start your computer
with the Windows NT compact disc inserted in the CD-ROM drive. To work
around this problem, remove the compact disc from the CD-ROM drive and
restart your computer.


Setting Up Windows NT version 4.0 on Computers with
Multiple CD-ROM Drives Installed
=======================================================================

If you have multiple compact disc drives installed, place the Windows NT 
compact disc in the drive that has first priority on your computer.


Windows NT SCSI Driver Changes
=======================================================================

With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT
Driver Library (\DRVLIB) included on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc. Check the following list to determine if any of your adapters are
affected by this change. If your computer has an adapter that appears on
this list, you must create a driver disk before installing Windows NT
version 4.0. Use this disk to install the appropriate driver(s) during
Setup, or keep the disk handy and install the driver using the Control Panel
once Setup is complete.

The following drivers have been moved:

     always.sys
     dtc329x.sys
     t128.syst13b.sys
     tmv1.sys
     ultra124.sys
     wd33c93.sys

The following adapters are affected by this change:

SCSI ADAPTERS -

     Always IN-2000
     Data Technology Corp. 3290
     Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter
     MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum-16
     Trantor T-128
     Trantor T-130B

DISK CONTROLLERS -

     UltraStor 124f EISA Disk Array Controller

Please see the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List for additional
information on these storage adapters.

To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver
Library:

     1. Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.
     2. Copy all files from the following directory to the blank disk:

        \drvlib\storage\retired\CPU_TYPE

        where CPU_TYPE is X86 if you are using a machine with an x86-based
        processor; MIPS if your computer uses a MIPS RISC processor; or
        ALPHA if your computer uses a Digital Alpha processor.
     3. Label this disk "Drivers Disk".

To install drivers from the drivers disk during Windows NT version 4.0
Setup:

     1. Start Windows NT Setup. 
        During the course of Setup, a message appears stating "Setup has
        recognized the following mass storage devices in your computer." 
     2. When prompted, press S to skip detection, then press S again to
        display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     3. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     4. Insert the Drivers Disk when prompted to do so, and select your host
        adapter from this list.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host
adapters without making the devices attached to it available for use:

     1. Restart Windows NT Setup. 
     2. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
        computer's hardware configuration...," press F6. 
        This prevents Windows NT Setup from performing disk controller
        detection and allows you to install the driver from the Drivers Disk
        you created. Note that all SCSI adapters will have to be installed
        manually.
     3. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not
        determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in
        your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter,"
        press S to display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     4. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     5. Insert the Drivers Disk you made when prompted to do so, and select
        your host adapter from this list. Note that in some cases, Windows
        NT Setup will repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers from your drivers disk after running Windows NT version
4.0 Setup:

     1. After installing the properly configured adapter in your machine,
        start Windows NT version 4.0 as normal.
     2. Click Start, point to Control Panel, then open the SCSI Adapters
        program.
     3. Select the Drivers tab, then click the Add button.
     4. Click the Have Disk button, insert your drivers disk into Drive A:,
        and then click OK.
     5. Highlight the desired driver from the list presented, and then click
        OK. Then, click Continue to load the driver.
     6. You need to restart your Windows NT version 4.0 system to activate
        the driver. Click the Restart Computer button to shutdown and
        restart.

Warning:

If you are upgrading from Windows NT version 3.51, you must know the names
of all SCSI adapters before running Setup. To view this list, open Windows
NT Setup (in the Main program group in Windows NT version 3.51) and click
Add/Remove SCSI Adapters on the Options menu. Record the names of all
adapters on this list and keep them handy for use during Windows NT version
4.0 Setup.


Network Adapter Drivers
=======================================================================

Microsoft provides network adapter drivers from third-party vendors on the 
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact discs.
These drivers, which are located in the \DRVLIB folder have all met 
specific standards of installation and operation. 

Most PCI, EISA, and MCA adapters in the \DRVLIB can be detected and
successfully installed during Setup. Most ISA and PCMCIA adapters are not
detected but can be installed manually during Setup. 

For ISA adapters that can be detected, two identical adapters cannot be
detected during Setup.  The adapter with the lowest I\O address will be
detected, while the others will not. They can, however, be installed
manually added. For multiprocessor systems, two identical ISA adapters may
not be supported due to hardware limitations of the adapter.  The NE2000 is
an example of this limitation.

Most network adapters in the \DRVLIB do not support the unattended answer 
file (unattend.txt) for use in automated installations of Windows NT.  
Exceptions are the IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring Adapter, IBM AutoStreamer 
Token Ring adapters, IBM Token Ring LanStreamer PCI adapter, 3Com 
Etherlink III PCI adapters, and the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B adapter.

Some adapters may quit functioning if you upgrade from an earlier version to 
the Windows NT version 4.0.  This can be caused by changes in the registry,
such as adapter driver name changes, service dependency changes, or an
obsolete network adapter driver. Removing the old driver and installing it
again from the menu will correct the startup problem for adapters listed on
the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).  Xircom IIPS and Eicon ISDN are
examples of adapters that must be reinstalled.

Some adapters generate errors during Setup because the configuration
settings cannot be verified.  This can be caused by conflicting settings for 
interrupt and I/O addresses.   The error can also be displayed if Setup
calls an executable helper which sets up the configuration.  If the adapter
driver starts and connects to the network, the error can be ignored.  If
not, the error is an indication there are resource conflicts which will have
to be fixed.  The Intel E100B and IBM Streamer adapters are examples of
drivers that use their own executable setup routines.

Microsoft does not recommend the use of 8-bit network adapters with 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server. Support for these adapters 
is included in some cases due to customer requirements, but older hardware 
represented by this technology does not provide good performance or 
reliability.

> Network PnP Mode

PnP mode is not supported. Network adapters that support PnP mode must be 
reconfigured with a software setup utility provided by the manufacturer. This 
includes system board mounted network adapters, 3Com EtherLink III B
models, and Standard Microsystems SMC8416 Ultra PnP adapters.

> Bus-Master Adapters

Bus-Master adapters are not supported on Motorola Power PC computers. 
These include the Proteon p1390, p1392, p1392plus, and IBM 4/16 Token 
Ring Adapter II. IBM Power PC systems are supported.

> PCMCIA Adapters

If your PCMCIA adapter does not start, or operates incorrectly, try using a 
different interrupt for the network adapter. Interrupts 2, 5, and 10 are
often reserved on portable computers. In these cases, Microsoft recommends 
changing the interrupt to 3, 11, or 15. If the settings are changed during 
installation, the adapter will not start until installation is completed and the
system is restarted. If you know the settings presented by Setup
will cause a conflict, you can change them, but the adapter will not start
until installation is completed and the computer is restarted.

> Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) Adapters

During Setup, selecting any Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) adapters
will result in a dialog box that cannot be exited. This will cause the
installation to fail because rebooting is necessary to recover. For these
adapters, complete the installation and add the adapter later.

> Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps

Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps adapters will stop 
working if you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51. Because the driver 
name changed for this adapter, and because of the subsequent effect on the 
registry, the IIps adapter must be manually removed and reinstalled.

> Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter drivers

If you install Windows NT version 4.0 from a network drive and have both
an Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter driver and a PCI SCSI 
controller installed, Setup may indicate one or more files are corrupt when
it verifies the copy from the temporary directory to the 
%systemroot%\system32\drivers folder.

This problem occurs because the network adapter is not reset correctly when 
Setup warm starts the computer. You can avoid this problem by turning the 
computer off and then back on instead of allowing Setup to warm start the 
computer.

> Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN Adapters

Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN adapters do not always work correctly in
multibus PCI-based computers.

> NE2000 or Compatible Network Adapters

Installing or upgrading to Windows NT 4.0 with a NE2000 or compatible
network adapter set to an I/O address of 340 hex, may cause the system to
hang when booting into text-mode Setup. If this occurs, either remove the
NE2000 adapter or change its I/O address and restart Setup to continue the
installation. The NE2000 will operate normally at I/O address 340 hex after
Setup is complete.

> AMD PCnet Adapters on Intergraph TD Workstations

Detecting early versions of the AMD PCnet adapter can cause the system to 
hang.  If this occurs, restart Windows NT Setup by rebooting the computer,
select the AM1500T network adapter and set the configuration parameters
manually to match the jumpers.  Intergraph models TD-1, TD2 and TD-3 
are examples of computers with the early AMD adapter built onto the 
system board.


Duplexing with the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA Controller
=======================================================================

If you utilize the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA controller and require 
duplexing with mirrored partitions, both controllers must be set to use 
64 heads/32 sectors translation.  The EISA partition and the operating 
system partition must both be located in the first 1024 cylinders.  It is 
also recommended both drives posses the same SCSI ID number.  By 
default, this is 0.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact Compaq 
support for details on advanced configuration options.

If the primary drive fails, it will be neccessay to move the shadowed drive 
to the first controller in order to restart the computer.  An alternate solution
is to change the controller boot order.  Make the shadowed drive's controller 
the primary boot controller.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact 
Compaq support for details on advanced configuration options.


Winnt/Winnt32 Disk Space Errors
=======================================================================

Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe will report an error if unable to find a drive
with enough diskspace available, or if the drive specified with the /t
switch has insufficient free disk space.  If such an error occurs, you must
free some disk space and then run Winnt or Winnt32 again.

In some cases, Winnt and Winnt32 will not report a disk space error, but at
some point during the file copy process, will report an error copying a
file due to lack of disk space. This occurs when the drive to which the
temporary directory, $win_nt$~ls, is being copied is formatted with a
cluster of size 32KB or greater and has only the minimum free disk space
allowed. If this error occurs, you must free additional disk space, and
re-run winnt/winnt32.

Running Windows NT Setup from MS-DOS 6.20 may cause invalid 
filename errors on files that start with an exclamation point.  The 
error message can be ignored and the files can be skipped.


HPFS File Systems
=======================================================================

Windows NT version 4.0 does not support the OS/2 File System (HPFS). You 
cannot access disks that are formatted with HPFS from Windows NT version
4.0. If you have a previous version of Windows NT installed on a disk
formatted with HPFS, Setup cannot upgrade it to Windows NT version 4.0.

You can use the Convert.exe program supplied with previous versions of 
Windows NT to convert disks formatted with HPFS to the Windows NT File 
System (NTFS). Windows NT version 4.0 Convert.exe does not provide this
capability. Do not convert any disks you need to access when using other
operating systems such as OS/2.

Note:
Convert.exe can convert only HPFS version 1.x drives smaller than 4
gigabytes (GB). It fails on HPFS 2.x drives (those HPFS drives larger than 4
GB).


Windows Messaging
=======================================================================

Note
The following information does not apply if you are running the Exchange
Client for Microsoft Exchange Server.

If you are a currently running Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 and
are using the Exchange Client, use the following procedure to remove 
Microsoft Exchange before upgrading to Windows NT version 4.0.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and then install Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     3. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Microsoft Exchange check
        box, and then click OK.
     4. After Microsoft Exchange has been removed, start Windows NT
        version 4.0 Setup.
     5. When prompted to select the type of installation, click Custom
        Setup.
     6. On the Select Components page, select Windows Messaging (new 
        name for Exchange in Windows NT version 4.0).

If you are a Windows NT 4.0 Beta Exchange Client user and you have already
installed Windows NT version 4.0 (final), you need to remove Exchange and
reinstall Windows Messaging to ensure proper operation of the Messaging
Client.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and install Windows Messaging after upgrading
from Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 to  Windows NT version 4.0
(final):

     1. Right-click the Taskbar, click Properties.
     2. On the Start menu Programs tab, click Remove.
     3. Select Microsoft Exchange from the list, and then click Remove.
     4. Click Close, and then click OK.
     5. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     6. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     7. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Windows Messaging check box,
        and then click OK.


Using Schedule+ 1.0 with Windows Messaging in NT 4.0
=======================================================================

Windows Messaging is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
When Windows Messaging is installed, you can still use Schedule+ 1.0 in
standalone mode, but you will not be able to send or receive meeting requests.

You are eligible for a free upgrade to Schedule+ 7.0.  In the U.S.,
call 1-800-360-7561. In Canada call, 1-800-933-4750. Outside the U.S.
and Canada, contact your local dealer.


Disable FPNW/DSMN for Windows NT Server version 3.51 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you are performing an upgrade from Windows NT Server 3.51 with FPNW or 
DSMN services installed on the computer, these services are not compatible 
with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Microsoft Services for NetWare will be released 
shortly for use with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Prior to upgrading to Windows NT 
Server 4.0, disable these services by selecting Control Panel, Services.  Select 
"File and Print Services for NetWare" or "Directory Service Manager for NetWare" 
from the list, click Startup then click Disabled.  You should not attempt to reinstall 
FPNW or DSMN for Windows NT Server 3.51 on Windows NT Server 4.0. 


Upgrading DNS Servers
=======================================================================

Before upgrading a Windows NT version 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server to
Windows NT version 4.0, you need to delete some registry entries. For more
information, see "To Upgrade a Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server" and
"To Install a DNS Server" in TCP/IP Help.


Upgrading WINS, DHCP, and RPL Databases
=======================================================================
	 
The information in this section pertains only to Windows NT Server. When
upgrading a Windows NT Server version 3.51 (or earlier) release to Windows
NT version 4.0, the databases for WINS, DHCP, and RPL must be converted to
the new database format. This is required because the services now use an
improved database engine that is faster and that compacts automatically to
prevent fragmentation and consequential growth of the database. The database
conversion procedure occurs automatically as part of an upgrade
installation.


Removing Remotely Possible/32 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you have Remotely Possible/32 version 2.0 or 2.1 installed on a computer
running Windows NT version 3.51, you must uninstall Remotely Possible before 
installing Windows NT version 4.0. If you do not, Windows NT might not
install correctly. You can uninstall Remotely Possible by running the
Remove.bat file located on the Remotely Possible distribution disk. After
you have upgraded to Windows NT version 4.0, you can reinstall Remotely
Possible.

For more information about running Remotely Possible/32 versions 2.0 and 2.1
under Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0, see the
Remotely Possible/32 section in "Application Notes" in Readme.wri.


Detecting and Disabling the Floating-Point Division Error
=======================================================================

Setup automatically detects the Intel Pentium floating-point division error.
If the error is detected on your system, Setup prompts you to disable the
floating-point hardware on the chip. If you choose not to have the
floating-point hardware disabled during Setup, you can disable the hardware
later with a command line utility called Pentnt.exe.


Digital Alpha Systems
=======================================================================

If you are installing this release on a Digital Alpha system, please consult
the Release Notes available from:
	http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/sysoft.htm


Micron Computers
=======================================================================

If you encounter problems during Windows NT version 4.0 Setup on your Micron
computer, upgrade your system BIOS to the latest BIOS version available from
Micron.


Displaying Setup on Laptop Computers
=======================================================================

During text mode setup, some laptops with the WDC 90C24 chipset may show
some screen text distortion.

Laptops support a mode that adds additional scan lines between rows of
characters. This allows the entire LCD to be used when in 80x25 line text
modes. However, when in 43 line text mode (the mode in which Windows NT
Setup runs), the additional scan lines are forced off the bottom of the 
display. Certain laptop machines that start in this mode exhibit this 
behavior. Users encountering this problem will not be able to see the white 
instruction line on the bottom of the setup screen. This line indicates what 
keystrokes are used to exit and continue Setup. Continue with Setup and the
video drivers will be reset upon entering the graphical (GUI) portion of
Windows NT Setup.


Disconnecting UPS Devices
=======================================================================

Disconnect the serial cable connecting an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 
device before running Setup. Windows NT attempts to automatically detect 
devices connected to serial ports, which can cause problems with UPS equipment.


Intergraph G91 Display Adapters
=======================================================================

The Weitek-compatible display driver included with Windows NT version 4.0
does not work with the Intergraph G91 display adapters. Contact Intergraph
for an updated driver.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0, run the
G91 display driver provided with the Intergraph computer.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. During the Windows NT version 4.0 Setup process, click Cancel when
        the Display Settings dialog box is displayed.
     2. Once installation has been completed, load the drivers supplied with
        the Intergraph computer.


Sound Blaster/SCSI Problems
=======================================================================

Sound Blaster/SCSI cards and PCI SCSI cards may display a blue screen
reading INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE when performing a new installation or an
upgrade. This occurs because the BIOS assigns the PCI SCSI card an interrupt
that is already in use.  If this occurs, physically remove the sound card
before reinstalling, or remove the driver during text mode portion of Setup
and then reinstall after the installation/upgrade is complete.


Devices That Must be Manually Installed
=======================================================================

The following devices must be manually installed. Do not choose to have
Windows NT version 4.0 Setup automatically detect them.

 E-Tech Pocket Fax/Modem
 Multi-tech Multimodem (various models)
 Penril modems (various models)

The Modems option in Control Panel will close when you attempt to
query these devices.


Using Multiple Windows NT Installations on a Single Computer
=======================================================================

If you are installing Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0 on a
computer already loaded with at least one other Windows NT installation,
and if the computer participates on a Windows NT domain, you must use a
different computer name and machine account for each Windows NT
installation. This is because a unique security identifier (SID) is used for 
each installation of Windows NT on a domain.


Using NTHQ If Setup Fails
=======================================================================

NTHQ detects the installed hardware components on x86-based computers. It 
was designed to assist Microsoft Product Support engineers when a computer
does not boot or becomes unstable. 

To use NTHQ, run Makedisk.bat from the \support\hqtool directory on the 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc. Makedisk.bat
creates a bootable floppy disk that you can use to start your computer and
automatically run the diagnostic tool.

3. Make program group changes and the registry.  (1.0 -> 1.0a)
4. Do the Winnt-> AS changes if it is such an upgrade. [NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0a]
5. Generate a repair diskette for the new system.
6. Set up the new system for secure operation.
7. Do all the above in a safe manner.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

1. Upgrade in place.  That is upgrade our running tree to a 1.0a system.  The main problem with this is that we need to be careful we don't end up with an unbootable system.

2. Install a new version and upgrade information from the current tree.  The problems with this are that it is hard to clone a tree from the current tree and be sure we have everything we need.  Third party software is a big issue.  It is difficult to transfer configuration information from one tree to another.  Also one can never no where there are hard coded paths to stuff.   Also the disk space requirement prevents most people from using this approach.  The advantage in this is that it is safe.  If the new tree doesn't work, the old tree is still around.

We are choosing to upgrade in place.

ALGORITHM TO UPGRADE IN PLACE

Upgrade is done basically by text setup.  It is possible to run a utility to gather information from a running system and apply it as an answer to the questions asked by text setup, however this is not implemented for this release.   The following is the sequence of events in an upgrade.

- Text setup boots and asks for hardware information.  May ask for third party driver information.  This is solely for use during Setup and is not applied to the tree to be upgraded.
- Finds out all NT installations which can be upgraded by looking at the boot.ini/NVRAM variables.  It applies the following criteria to check if a system can be upgraded.
	- An NT tree actually exists as described by the boot.ini/NVRAM boot set.
	- Version as found from the registry on the tree is less than or equal to the current version.  
	- The type of NT ( WINNT/AS) is the same as our current product.
- The valid installations are presented to the user. The user can choose to upgrade an installation or choose a new tree for installation.  
	- If the user had attempted to upgrade the tree before, the user is warned about this and can choose to either reattempt the upgrade or install fresh into the same tree, backing up the hives.  
	- If the tree chosen for upgrade doesn't have enough space or its corresponding system partition doesn't have enough space, the user is warned about this.  The user can either exit setup and create enough space or choose another tree for upgrade or specify another tree to install.
Note that if there is a single tree for upgrade, all the analysis above is done without user input and then the user is presented with the appropriate dialog for input.
- If the user selects to cancel upgrade, he is given the choice of selecting a new partition / directory.  If the partition / directory he selects is the same one as the one offered to him before ( from the osloader or from the NT installations) the user is again offered the choice of upgrade / fresh install.  If he indicates he wants to install fresh we will clean out the NT tree except for the known hives which are renamed.
- If the user accepts upgrade, text setup marks the registry on the system with the upgradeinprogress value.  It then adds the system ( minus new network stuff  and hives and minus other files if a win31 system also present in same place) to the copy list and copies it.  The files are only copied if present on the target unless marked mandatory.  It also deletes files which have been removed from the product since 1.0.
- Does whatever registry modification is needed in the system hive:
	- Deletes keys that have disappeared since 1.0.
	- Add keys that have been added since 1.0 and the values within.
	- Disables the network services from starting, storing the old start values.  Other services may also be disabled if they cause service controller popups.
- Sets up for winlogon to execute setup in upgrade mode (tell setup - it is an upgrade, - win31 also present in directory, - where source is.).
- Continue the boot.
- When winlogon executes setup in upgrade mode it does not block SAM initialization.  Just runs gui setup before running winlogon.
- Gui setup comes up, realizes it is an upgrade in initial.inf.  It does the following:
	- [Do any registry modifications that can be deferred from the text setup stage to the gui stage].
                - Make the product version and source entries.
- Calls network setup to upgrade the network.
	- Sets up for setacl conversion.
	- Prepares emergency repair diskette. (is it possible to hold hives as they may be big?)
	- If  process succeeded delete local source if present and clear the UpgradeInProgress and SetupInProgress values.
	- Invokes perfmon provided code to convert the old perfmon data into the new format.
	- Reboots.
- If the above process fails then user can always install a fresh 1.0a system into the NT tree.

NETWORK UPGRADE (PROVIDED BY TERRYK)

1.	In text mode setup, the upgrade.inf file will copy all the network related inf files (oem*.inf) to the system with all the other setup files.
2.	During second boot (GUI) setup, it will do the following:
2.1.	Search under "Registry\Machine\Software\Microsoft\XXX\CurrentVersion\NetRules" (where XXX is the network components) and get a list of update inf file names and inf options. We will skip all the file name which ends with a number (i.e., oemnsv04.inf) because they may not belonged to Microsoft.
2.2.	Call each inf file with [Upgrade] option with the src path points to the CD or floppy disk. The new inf file will put the upgrade file list into the setup copy list. Meanwhile, the inf file will also upgrade the registry for the upgrade component (if necessary).
2.3.	If the update option list contains special component (i.e., TCP/IP, NetBT , streams,...), we will call the new inf file with [Install] option to install the new component. The new inf file should take care of the old components by either disable the components or remove the components from the registry directly.
2.4.	Call setup's [copyfilelist] to copy the upgrade files before we start the network control panel.
2.5.	Enable all the network services by changing the StartType value to the original one (which we saved during text mode setup).
2.6.	Start Network Control Panel Applet.
2.7.	Recompute binding
2.8.	Restart network
2.9.	Query domain name in Winnt->AS case and do necessary.[NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0A]

SAFETY DURING UPGRADE

Since we are upgrading in place, there are chances that midway through the upgrade we may fail and the user ends up with an unbootable system.  To guard against this we need to implement safety measures.  We are not implementing measures to let the user go back to the old system.  The user is only guaranteed to end up with a new system which boots.

Journalling was considered as a measure to implement safety, however it is too difficult to implement in the given timeframe.

What is implemented is the following:

- On failure the user can always reattempt upgrade.  Upgrade is designed in such a way that it can be reapplied any number of times without any restrictions.  If you fail during the upgrade process you can boot text setup again and reapply upgrade.

- In the remote possibility that upgrade just doesn't end up yielding a good system, the user can always install fresh into the same tree and Setup will back up the hives for the user.  Tools can be provided with the resource kit to extract information from the backed up hives and reapply them to the new hives.  The difficult part here may be the account information.

WINNT->AS UPGRADE  [NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0A]

On AS systems we need to provide for a WINNT->AS upgrade.   This can be a WINNT -> Primary Domain controller or a WINNT -> Backup Domain controller.  We are not considering WINNT->Backup Domain controller because of the following reasons:

- Most cases of an AS upgrade are going to be in environments where a person will upgrade his WINNT machine which has lots of accounts to a Primary Domain controller.
- Changing the WINNT to a backup domain controller involves changing the sid of the account domain to the sid of the Primary Domain controller and fixing any place where this sid appears.  This is definitely not trivial, if not impossible.
- The work involved will take us more than the 1.0a timeframe.

The work involved in converting a WINNT -> Primary Domain controller is:

- Text setup to set the registry to block SAM initilization on GUI Setup boot.  Also pass an input parameter to GUI Setup indicating that we have a WINNT-AS upgrade.	
- During GUI Setup network setup queries domain name in Winnt->AS case and applies it to the registry.
-GUI Setup creates event "\NT_CONVERT_TO_AS" to inform Sam that the database needs to be converted and sets event "\INSTALLATION_SECURITY_HOLD" to ask SAM to start the process.
- SAM starts the conversion process and does the following:
	- Create additional GlobalGroups:
		- Domain Admins
		- Domain Users
		- Domain Replicator
	- Change "None" GlobalGroup to "Users" GlobalGroup
	- Create additional LocalGroups:
		- System Operators
		- Account Operators
		- Print Operators
	- Change ACLs in SAM
		- Account Operators now used
	- Delete PowerUsers LocalGroup [TBD: CAN THIS BE LEFT AROUND, THIS CAN SIMPLIFY THE UPGRADE]
	- Signals event "\SAM_SERVICE_STARTED" once it is done.
- Setup waits on event "\SAM_SERVICE_STARTED"  which is signalled when initialization is done.
- Change the product type in the registry to AS.
- Does the stuff needed by LSA:
 	- Add a privilege to the administrators account.
- If Winnt -> AS creates the extra common program group to hold AS items.

IMPLEMENTATION

MAKING UPGRADE REGISTRY ENTRIES IN THE SIF FILE

Brief Description of Registry Changes During Upgrade

- Copy over the new hives as systnew, softnew, deftnew.  These are available as templates for our use.
- Save the perflib data & disable the network components in the destination  hive.
- Recurse down the controlset001 in systnew and copy any keys/values NOT PRESENT in the destination. Do the same with the softnew hive.
- Delete all keys listed in the sif file.
- Add all keys / values listed in the sif file.

Sections:

1. The following section allows us to specify services to disable which may
cause popups when net services are disabled:

[NetServicesToDisable]
ServiceName1
...

2. The following section allows us to remove keys which have been removed
since the Windows NT 3.1 release.  The key is deleted recursively, all
subkeys are deleted too.

[KeysToDelete]
<RootName>, <RootRelativePath>
...

where <RootName> ::=  System | Software | Default | ControlSet

An example of this is:

ControlSet, Services\hpfs_rec.


3. The following sections allow us to add/change keys / values under keys which have changed since the Windows NT 3.1 release.  Most changes are picked up the recursive comparison of the hives that is executed first. New keys and values need not be listed in this section.  This section is to catch the following cases:

   - When the hive has been changed since 511 and somebody changes the
     same value again.
   - When some value which already exists in the hive is changed.

[KeysToAdd]
<RootName>, <RootRelativePath> [, <ValueSection>]
...

If the <ValueSection> is not specified, the template hive is used to find out all subkeys/values to create under the root name.  If the <ValueSection> is specified it is of the following format:

[<ValueSection>]
<ValueName> [, <ValueType>, <ValueData>]
...

<ValueType> and <ValueData> are optional and when these are not specified the template hive is used to find out what these should be.  More often we do not need to use the <ValueType> and <ValueData>.  The only time we need to use these is when the data in the template hives is not what we want in the final registry.

Format of the value is the following:

a. Type REG_SZ:          name , REG_SZ,           "value string"
b. Type REG_EXPAND_SZ    name , REG_EXPAND_SZ,    "value string"
c. Type REG_MULTI_SZ     name , REG_MULTI_SZ,     "value string1", "value string2", ...
d. Type REG_BINARY       name , REG_BINARY,       byte1, byte2, ...
e. Type REG_BINARY_DWORD name , REG_BINARY_DWORD, dword1, dword2, ...
f. Type REG_DWORD        name , REG_DWORD,        dword

examples:

System, REG_SZ, lsass.exe
MyValue
Hello1, REG_EXPAND_SZ, "%SystemRoot%\nt\system32"
DeleteList, REG_MULTI_SZ, "file1" "file2" "file3"
Data, REG_BINARY, 00, 01, 02, 0a, 1f
VideoGroupOrder, REG_BINARY_DWORD, 00000001, 0000000a, 0000000f
Start, REG_DWORD, 00000003


REG_BINARY_DWORD is actually REG_BINARY however it lets us specify the binary data using dwords. All data in the value data is in hex, however don't prefix the data with 0x.  This is assumed.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\base\ntsetup\textmode\spddlang\spddlang.txt ===
This file details an interface to be used to supply locale/language-specific
function for display, keyboard handling, etc, within text setup.

The goals are as follows:

1) Provide a straightforward means for supporting fully localized text display,
   keyboard handling, and other features, in various locales, especially
   Far Eastern ones.

2) Avoid impacting setupdd.sys's size or performance when such function is not
   required.

To this end features such as DBCS font support, locale-specific keyboard detection,
and various other features are to be removed and placed into an export driver.
Setupdd.sys will be linked such that this driver is automatically referenced
and loaded when setupdd.sys is loaded. Setupdd.sys will itself export a set of
routines for use by the language-specific driver when carrying out its function.

Language-specific drivers will be built in the setup\textmode\spddlang directory.
Such drivers are logically part of setupdd.sys. No special set of include files
will be created for the interfaces below; they will be contained in various
header files in setup\textmode\kernel. Language-specific drivers' SOURCES files
should be set up so they include setup\textmode\kernel in their INCLUDES and
#include spprecmp.h.

*******************************************************************************

The functions listed below must be exported from every language-specific driver.

NTSTATUS
SplangInitializeFontSupport(
    IN PCWSTR BootDevicePath,
    IN PCWSTR DirectoryOnBootDevice
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to allow the language-specific
    font support to be initialized. The language-specific driver should
    load any font it requires and perform any additioanl initialization.

Arguments:

    BootDevicePath - supplies the path of the device from which the system
        booted. This is a full NT-style path that includes a directory spec.

    DirectoryOnBootDevice - supplies directory relative to root of boot
        device.

Return Value:

    NT Status code indicating outcome. If this routine returns a non-success
    status code, then setupdd.sys will not switch into non-US character mode.
    The implementation of this routine is free to call SpBugCheck or otherwise
    inform the user of any errors if it wishes to halt setup if font
    initialization fails.

--*/


NTSTATUS
SplangTerminateFontSupport(
    VOID
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine may be called in certain conditions to cause font support
    for a particular language to be terminated. The implementation should
    clean up any resources allocated during SplangInitializeFontSupport().

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    NT Status code indicating outcome.

--*/


PVIDEO_FUNCTION_VECTOR
SplangGetVideoFunctionVector(
    IN SpVideoType VideoType,
    IN PSP_VIDEO_VARS VideoVariableBlock
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys upon successful return from
    SplangInitializeFontSupport, to request a pointer to a vector of
    language-specific display support routines for a given display
    type (vga or frame buffer).

Arguments:

    VideoType - a value from the SpVideoType enum indicating which display
        vector is requested. Currently one of SpVideoVga or SpVideoFrameBuffer.

    VideoVariableBlock - supplies a pointer to a block of video variables that
        are shared between the high-level code in setup\textmode\spvideo.c and
        the display-specific code.

Return Value:

    Pointer to the language-specific video functions vector to use for
    displaying text. NULL if the requested type is not supported. In this case
    the display will not be switched into non-US character mode.

--*/


ULONG
SplangGetColumnCount(
    IN PCWSTR String
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to determine how many columns
    on the screen a particular string will occupy. This may be different
    than the number of characters in the string due to full/half width
    characters in the character set, etc. Full width chars occupy two columns
    whereas half-width chars occupy one column. If the font in use is
    fixed-pitch or does not support DBCS, the number of columns is by
    definition equal to the number of characters in the string.

Arguments:

    String - points to unicode string whose width in columns is desired.

Return Value:

    Number of columns occupied by the string.

--*/


PWSTR
SplangPadString(
    IN int    Size,
    IN PCWSTR String
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to generate a padded string
    appropriate for SBCS or DBCS as appropriate.

Arguments:

    Size - specifies the length to which to pad the string.

    String - points to unicode string that needs to be padded.

Return Value:

    Pointer to padded string. Note that this is a static buffer and thus
    the caller must duplicate the string if it is needed across multiple
    calls to this routine.

VOID
SplangSelectKeyboard(
    IN BOOLEAN UnattendedMode,
    IN PVOID SifHandle,
    IN PHARDWARE_COMPONENT *HwComponents
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to allow language-specific processing
    for the keyboard selection. The implementation can confirm a keyboard
    type at this time.

Arguments:

    UnattendedMode - supplies a flag indicating whether we are running in
        unattended mode. If so, the implementation may wish to do nothing,
        since the user will not be entering any paths.

    SifHandle - supplies handle to open setup information file (txtsetup.sif).

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    None. If a failure occurs, it is up to the implementation to decide whether
    to continue or to SpBugCheck.

    This routine will be called before the user is asked to enter any paths
    or other text that includes typing anything other than keys such as
    ENTER, function keys, backspace, escape, etc.

Arguments:

    UnattendedMode - supplies a flag indicating whether we are running in
        unattended mode. If so, the implementation may wish to do nothing,
        since the user will not be entering any paths.

    SifHandle - supplies handle to open setup information file (txtsetup.sif).

    Directory - supplies the directory on the boot device from which the
        new layout dll is to be loaded.

    KeyboardVector - supplies the address of a pointer to the keyboard
        vector table. The implementation should overwrite this value with
        whatever is returned from SpLoadKbdLayoutDll().

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    None. If a failure occurs the implementation must leave the currently active
    keybaord in place.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to retreive the unicode value for
    a particular line drawing character. An implementation must make these
    characters available in the character set somehow.

Arguments:

    WhichChar - supplies the index of the character desired.

Return Value:

    Unicode value for the character in question. Because the character
    will be displayed using the language-specific module, the implementation
    can materialize this character by playing whatever tricks it needs to,
    such as overlaying a hardcoded glyph into the character set, etc.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to cause language-specific
    information to be written into the current control set in the registry.

Arguments:

    SifHandle - supplies a handle to the open setup information file
        (txtsetup.sif).

    ControlSetKeyHandle - supplies a handle to the current control set
        root in the registry (ie, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet).

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    NT Status value indicating outcome. A non-success status is considered
    critical and causes Setup to abort.

--*/


BOOLEAN
SplangQueryMinimizeExtraSpacing(
    VOID

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to determine whether to
    eliminate uses of extra spacing on the screen to set off things
    like menus and lists from text. Languages whose text takes up
    a lot of room on the screen might opt to eliminate such spacing
    to allow menus to display more than a couple of items at a time, etc.

    The return value affects numerous screens, such as the partition menu,
    upgrade lists, etc.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    Boolean value indicating whether the implementation wants unnecessary
    spaces eliminated when text, menu, etc, are displayed.

Microsoft Professional Developers Conference
September 23, 1997

The sample migration DLLs were written for demonstration purposes only.  They have been through minimal testing, and there may be problems upgrading settings on some Windows 95 configurations.

The Screen Saver DLL supports only the following screen savers:

    Blank Screen
    Curves and Colors
    Flying Through Space
    Scrolling Marquee
    Mystify Your Mind

All other screen savers will not be migrated by this DLL.  In addition, the migration DLL will be removed from future releases of Windows NT, as screen saver migration will be supported by Windows NT Setup.

You can build the Screen Saver Migration DLL yourself by opening migrate.dsp in Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and then building as usual.  If you do not use Visual C++, you will have to create your own makefile.  The migration DLL sample requires MC.EXE from the Windows NT 5.0 SDK (provided at the PDC).  You must also compile the DLL on Windows NT because it has a UNICODE message file (msg.mc).

The PVIEW DLL supports the upgrade of PVIEW95.EXE on Visual C++. You can build the PVIEW DLL yourself by opening pview.dsp as described in the notes for the Screen Saver Migration DLL above. 

To use PVIEW DLL during setup, copy pview.exe and migrate.dll into a common directory. When Setup prompts you to provide extra upgrade files, hit the "Have Disk" button and enter the location of this directory.

You are welcome to use the sample code in the development of your own migration DLL.  In particular, the functions in poolmem.c and miginf.c are general-pupose and are designed to be used in any migration DLL.

    The phonebook also supports the concept of "custom" entries, i.e. entries
    that fit the MEDIA followed by DEVICE subsection rules but which do not
    include certain expected key fields.  A custom entry is not editable with
    the UI, but may be chosen for connection.  This gives us a story for new
    drivers added by 3rd parties or after release and not yet fully supported
    in the UI. (NOTE: Support for this may be dropped in RAS API)

This component appears to use a type of device driver called a file
system filter driver. File system filter drivers allow other companies to write programs that can access files on your hard disks. They are typically
used in products such as virus checkers or backup applications, but may also be 
used with storage devices like CD-ROMs, 'jukeboxes', or tape drives. 

This particular driver has not been tested with Microsoft Windows 2000, and you should not continue to upgrade with this driver loaded. However, your computer does not have enough information to identify which add-on product is using this driver.

You can proceed by doing one of the following:

1. Identify and uninstall the program that is using this driver. Sometimes the driver name clearly identifies which product uses it. A current list of driver names and the programs that use them can be found in the Release Notes on your Windows 2000 CD, or at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/deploy/fileprint/fsfilteruse.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Devices. Find the entry for this driver, click <B>Startup</B>, and then click Disabled. Click OK, click Close, and then restart your computer. Restart Windows 2000 Setup. You can proceed with the upgrade, but the product that
was using this driver will not function properly now.

For a list of devices supported by Windows 2000, please see the Microsoft Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List at  http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl. Your Windows 2000 CD includes a copy of this list (drive:\Support\hcl.txt) that was accurate as of the date Windows 2000 was released.

For each service pack, we will create a new subdirectory.  The first service pack to use
this method is sp1, so the first directory created is sp1.

When you build the resourcedll\sp1 directory, a couple of things happen:

The first thing is that it creates a dll called sp1res.dll.  This dll doesn't
contain any code or entry points; it just has resources in it.   Adding new
string resources is simply a matter   of editing the sp1res.mc file in this
directory and recompiling.

The second thing that happens is that it creates sp1res.h, and copies it to the
\nt\private\inc directory.  This header file contains the resource IDs for all
the resources in sp1res.dll.

Now, how does this get used?  There are two different scenarios:
(1) a binary  wants to add a resource string to be used in logging
event log messages.
(2) a binary wants to use an resource string for some other reason, such as
displaying in a message box.

In both scenarios, the programmer will include the sp1res.h file in his source
code, so that he has access to the correct resource IDs.

In scenario (1), you simply add the path and name of sp1res.dll to the appropriate
registry key for the component that logs the error message; for example in W2K
bug 12918, dmboot.sys is the component that logs the error message, so under
the key HKLM,"SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\dmboot", you would
change EventFileLog from its current value of %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\dmboot.sys
to a new value of %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\dmboot.sys; %SystemRoot%\System32\sp2res.dll.
When event viewer encounters an error message logged with a source of dmboot, it
will look for the resource string first in dmboot.sys, and then in sp2res.dll.

In scenario (2), the coder needs to manually do a LoadLibraryEx() on sp1res.dll,
and a LoadString() for whatever resource he is looking for.   You should use the
LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE flag when using LoadLibraryEx().  This will be completely
straightforward in the cases where the existing code already requires a LoadLibrary
and LoadString to get at its resources; you'll just need to load an additional
library.   It will be slightly less straightforward in those cases where the
existing binary is just getting resources out of its own resource section, since
this will involve adding new code to load a library that was not necessary
before; however, even in those cases, it's not exactly rocket science.

USING SC.EXE TO DEVELOP WINDOWS NT SERVICES  
January 1995

(From MSDN Library, July 1996)

A little-known command-line utility, SC.EXE, can help you develop your services for Microsoft Windows NT. SC.EXE, which is provided in the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) MSTOOLS directory, implements calls to all of the Windows NT service control application programming interface (API) functions. You can set the parameters to these functions by specifying them on the command line. SC.EXE also displays service status and retrieves the values stored in the status structure fields. The utility also lets you specify the name of a remote computer so that you can call the service API functions or view the service status structures on the remote computer.

This article describes how to use the SC.EXE utility to obtain detailed information about Windows NT services. For more information about developing Windows NT services and for detailed reference information about the Windows NT Service API functions, such as ControlService and QueryServiceStatus, see the Win32 SDK documentation (Development Library, Product Documentation, SDKs).

SC.EXE is a development tool that provides more detailed and accurate information about services than the two end-user utilities that are provided with the operating system. The Services Control Panel application and the network command-line interface, NET.EXE, can tell you that a service is running, stopped, or paused. These tools are fine for completely debugged and running services when everything is going smoothly. But when things go wrong, as sometimes happens when developing new code, the information provided by these tools can be misleading.

For instance, if during the development stage your service hangs in the start-pending state, the Control Panel and NET.EXE report its state as running. If the service hangs when in the stop-pending state, NET START reports the status as running, and the Control Panel reports it as stopped. If you then attempt to start it, the Control Panel tells you the service is already running. This can be quite confusing.

SC.EXE lets you query the service status and retrieve the values stored in the status structure fields. The NET.EXE program and the Services Control Panel application don't provide the complete status for the service. The SC program, however, will tell you the exact state of the service as well as show you the last checkpoint number and wait hint. The checkpoint can then be used as a debugging tool because it provides a clear indication of how far along the initialization had progressed before the program froze.

SC.EXE also allows you to call any of the service control API functions and vary any of the parameters from the command line. This offers several advantages to the service developer. For instance, it provides a convenient way of creating or configuring the service information in the Registry and the Service Control Manager's database. The developer doesn't have to configure the service by manually creating entries in the Registry and then rebooting the machine in order to force the Service Control Manager to update its database.

As a command line program, SC.EXE can also be used to create tests for your service. You can create batch (command) files that call SC.EXE with various parameters that control the service. This is useful if you want to see how your service behaves when it is repeatedly started and stopped. If you have more than one service in your service process, you can leave one service running so that the process doesn't go away, and then repeatedly start and stop the other service while looking for evidence of memory leaks due to an incomplete cleanup.
The following sections contain reference information for the commands SC, SC QC, and SC QUERY.

SC

The SC command-line utility uses the following syntax:

Syntax1
sc [Servername] Command Servicename [Optionname= Optionvalue...]

Syntax2
sc [Command]

Use Syntax1 to run SC.EXE. Use Syntax2 to display help information (except for the "query" command--see the "Comments" section below for more information).

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Command
Specifies the SC command. Note that many of the SC commands require administrative privilege on the specified computer. SC supports the following commands:
  
Command	Description

config		Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).

continue	Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.

control		Sends a control to a service.

create		Creates a service (adds it to the registry).

delete		Deletes a service (from the registry).

EnumDepend	Enumerates service dependencies.

GetDisplayName	Gets the DisplayName for a service.

GetKeyName	Gets the ServiceKeyName for a service.

interrogate	Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.

pause		Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.

qc		Queries configuration for the service. For detailed information, see the reference section, "SC QC."

query		Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services. For detailed information, see the reference section, "SC QUERY."

start		Starts a service.

stop		Sends a STOP request to a service.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional command parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs.

For a list of the available Optionname values, request help for the command by entering "sc Command", where Command is a valid SC command name, as listed in the Command parameter description above.

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. The range of valid values is often restricted for each Optionname. For a list of available values, request help for each command. 

Comments

Many of the commands require administrator privileges, so it's a good idea to make sure that you are an administrator of the machine where the development is being done.

When you enter "SC" with no parameters, SC.EXE displays help information that lists the available commands. When you enter "SC" followed by a command name, you can get specific information about that command. For example, enter "SC CREATE" to get help specific to the CREATE command. 

The exception to this syntax is "SC QUERY", which dumps the status of all services and drivers currently running in the system. For help on the QUERY command, enter "SC", and respond to the prompt, "Would you like to see help for the QUERY command?" by entering "y" for yes.

When you use the START command, you can pass arguments to the service's main function. Note that the arguments are not passed to the service process's main function.

SC CREATE

The SC CREATE command creates an entry for the service in the Registry and in the Service Control Manager's database.

Syntax1
sc [Servername] create Servicename [Optionname=Optionvalue...]

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the Registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs. The SC QUERY command supports the following values:
  
Optionname	Optionvalue
Description

type=		own, share, interact, kernel, filesys	
Type of service being created. Optionvalues include types used by drivers. (default = share)

start=		boot, system, auto, demand, disabled
Start type for the service. Option values include types used by drivers. (default = demand)

error=		normal, severe, critical, ignore
Severity of error if the service fails to start during boot. (default = normal)

binPath=	(string)	
Path name to the service binary file. There is no default for this. This string must be supplied.

group=		(string)
Name of group which this service is a member of. The list of groups are stored in the Registry under ServiceGroupOrder. (default = nothing)

tag=		(string)
If this string is set to "yes", SC will obtain a TagId from the CreateService call. However, SC does not display the tag so it's pointless to use this. (default = nothing)

depend=		(space separated string)
Names of services or groups which must start before this service.

obj=		(string)
Name of account in which the service will run. For drivers, this is the NT driver object name. (default = LocalSystem)

DisplayName=	(string)	
A string that can be used by user-interface programs to identify the service.

password=	(string)
A password string. This is required if an account other than LocalSystem is used.

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. See the Optionname reference for a list of supported values. When a string is to be input, the use of empty quotes means that an empty string will be passed in.

Comments

The SC CREATE command performs the operations of the CreateService API function. 

Example 1

The following example creates a registry entry for the service named "NewService" on the computer called "\\myserver":
  
sc \\myserver create NewService binpath= c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe
  
By default this service will be created as a WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS with a SERVICE_DEMAND_START start-type. It will not have any dependencies, and will run in the LocalSystem security context.

Example 2

The following example creates the service on the local computer as an auto-start service that runs in its own process. It has dependencies on the TDI group and on the NetBIOS service. Notice that you must add quotes around the list of space-separated dependencies.
  
sc create NewService binpath= c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe type= own 
 start= auto depend= "+TDI Netbios"
  
Example 3

The service developer can run the service in the context of the kernel debugger by temporarily changing the binary path (image path) for the service. The following example shows how to call SC to change the service configuration:
  
sc config NewService binpath= "ntsd -d c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe"
  
This example causes the Service Control Manager to invoke NTSD.EXE with the following argument string:
  
"-d c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe".
  
NTSD will in turn break on the debugger when it loads NEWSERV.EXE so that breakpoints can be set in the service code.
SC QC

The SC QC "query configuration" command lists information about the service configuration from the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure.

Syntax1
sc [Servername] qc Servicename [Buffersize]

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Buffersize
Optional. Specifies the size of the buffer in bytes. 

Comments

The SC QC command displays the contents of the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure:
  
Information displayed by the SC QC command	Corresponding field from the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure

TYPE			dwServiceType
START_TYPE		dwStartType
ERROR_CONTROL		dwErrorControl
BINARY_PATH_NAME	lpBinaryPathName
LOAD_ORDER_GROUP	lpLoadOrderGroup
TAG			dwTagId
DISPLAY_NAME		lpDisplayName
DEPENDENCIES		lpDependencies
SERVICE_START_NAME	lpServiceStartName

Example 1

The following example queries the configuration of the service named "NewService" that was created in Example 1 for the Create command:
  
sc \\myserver qc NewService
  
The SC utility displays the following information:
  
SERVICE_NAME: NewService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe

        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : NewService
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
  
NewService has the ability to share a process with other services. It will not be auto-started. The binary file name is NEWSERV.EXE. This service doesn't depend on any other services, and will run in the Local System security context. Because this basically returns the results from a call to QueryServiceStatus, a more detailed explanation of these results can be obtained from the documentation on that API function.

SC QUERY

The SC QUERY command obtains information about the service.

Syntax
sc [Servername] query { Servicename | Optionname= Optionvalue... }

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the command on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver".

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the Registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service. Note that you can supply either the Servicename or the options, but not both. When the Servicename is supplied, the other options are ignored.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs. The SC QUERY command supports the following values:
  
Optionname	Optionvalue
Description

type=		driver, service, all	
Type of services to enumerate (default = service)

state=		active, inactive, all
State of services to enumerate  (default = active)

bufsize=	(numeric value)
The size in bytes of the enumeration buffer (default = 1024 bytes)

ri=		(numeric value)
The resume index number at which to begin the enumeration (default = 0)

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. See the Optionname reference for a list of supported values.

Comments

The SC QUERY command displays the contents of the SERVICE_STATUS structure:
  
Information displayed by SC QUERY command	Corresponding field from the SERVICE_STATUS structure

TYPE			dwServiceType
STATE			dwCurrentState, dwControlsAccepted
WIN32_EXIT_CODE		dwWin32ExitCode
SERVICE_EXIT_CODE	dwServiceSpecificExitCode
CHECKPOINT		dwCheckPoint
WAIT_HINT		dwWaitHint

Using the SC QUERY command after booting the machine will tell you whether or not an attempt was made to start this service. If the service was started successfully, the WIN32_EXIT_CODE field should contain a zero (0). If the service failed to start when an attempt was made, this field should contain an exit code provided by the service when it realized it couldn't start.

Examples

To query the status of the service, "NewService," enter:
  
sc query NewService
  
SC displays the following information:
  
    SERVICE_NAME: NewService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        STATE              : 1  STOPPED
                           (NOT_STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 1077       (0x435)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
  
Notice that there is an exit code for this service, even though it has not yet been run. Entering the Windows NT command "net helpmsg 1077" at the command line returns the following text information for error 1077:
  
No attempts to start the service have been made since the last boot.
  
Net Helpmsg can be used to display the text for most Windows NT error messages. This particular exit code indicates that this service hasn't yet been run. Although obvious in this case, this particular exit code is a useful one to look for if you are expecting your service to be auto-started or perhaps when another auto-start service has a dependency on your service. 

To enumerate status for active services and drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query 
  
To display status for the messenger service, use the following command:
  
sc query messenger 
  
To enumerate only active drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query type= driver
  
To enumerate only Win32 services, use the following command:
  
sc query type= service
  
To enumerate all services and drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query state= all
  
To enumerate with a 50 byte buffer, use the following command:
  
sc query bufsize= 50
  
To enumerate with resume index = 14, use the following command:
  
sc query ri= 14 
  
To enumerate all interactive services, use the following command:
  
sc query type= service type= interact

EVENT_CALL_TO_FUNCTION_FAILED is the most common use (26 uses) of ScLogEvent
 - add a wrapper function for this and simplify the calls.

Unify codepaths in ScTerminateServiceProcess -- two blocks of duplicated code.

Slight shutdown perf improvements?
    1.  Make special stop message asynchronous
    2.  Don't wait for the process to terminate on shutdown
    3.  Use a separate transact critsec per image record

sc.exe -- When sc query (or enumdepend) fails b/c buffer is too small, print out
command line that the user should use to get all the info (or the remaining info)

Client -- StartServiceCtrlDispatcher[A,W] need to be more similar.  They're
currently very different.

Release locks around calls to ReportEvent and srvsvc portion of SetServiceBits?

GetDefaultDomainName -- is there a Win32 API for this?

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6C:\WIN16APS\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\NORMAL.DOT     Differences between Win32 and Win16 Registry APIs Jaime Sasson Jaime Sasson Microsoft Word 6.0    Differences between Win32 and Win16 Registry APIs Auther:  Jaime Sasson Date:    04/29/94 Version: 1.0 This document describes the differences between the 16-bit registry APIs and the equivalent 32-bit APIs implemented on Windows NT. The features of the 16-bit APIs that are not present on the corresponding 32-bit API, were added to the WOW layer of Windows NT to correct problems caused on some 16-bit apps. Except for the behavior of RegDeleteKey, none of these features are documented on the Win16 Programmer's Reference. Here are the differences: 1. On Win16 a handle of value 0 is equivalent to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.     On NT, such a handle is invalid.    This behavior of the Win16 APIs is not documented.    This difference affects all Registry APIs.    This feature was added due to problems on Lotus Amipro. 2. On Win16, APIs that take a subkey name, interpret:         hKey = 0, and lpszSubKey = ".classes\\foo\\bar"    equivalent to:         hKey = HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and lpszSubKey = "foo\\bar"    This behavior of the Win16 APIs is not documented.    This difference affects the following APIs:         RegCreateKey         RegDeleteKey         RegOpenKey         RegQueryValue         RegSetValue    This feature was added due to problems on Lotus Amipro. 3. On Win16, RegDeleteKey deletes a key and all its subkeys.    On NT, it does not delete subkeys recursively.    This behavior of the Win16 API is documented.    The behavior of the Win32 is also documented.    This feature was added due to problems on MS Publisher.    It was decided on the early design phase of the registry APIs that this would be the behavior of RegDeleteKey.  This decision was based on security issues, and some other characteristics of  NT that would make this API incompatible with the 16-bit API anyway (e.g. multiple processes deleting the same key at the same time).    This is the only documented behavior of the 16-bit registry API that is not implemented on NT. 4. On Win16 RegQueryValue:     4.1 - Succeeds when the buffer for the data is not big enough for the data. In this case the API will copy to the buffer whatever fits in the buffer. There is no way for the caller to find out whether or not the data returned is the complete data, if the size of the data returned is exactly the size of the buffer supplied by the caller.           On NT, the API will return an error code indicating that the buffer is not big enough for the data. The API will also return the required buffer size, so that the caller can allocate a bigger buffer and retry the call. In case of failure due to buffer not big enough, the caller cannot assume that the buffer contains partial data.           The documentation of the 16 bit API is not clear about this behavior. It just says that the API will return in one of its parameters, the number of characters that were copied to the buffer, but it doesn't say if the API should fail if the buffer is not big enough.          The behavior of the NT API is documented in details.           This feature was added due to problems MS Works.    4.2 - Succeeds and returns an empty string if the API is called on a key that has no value.         - On NT, the API returns an error code indicating that the value doesn't exist.           This behavior on Win16 is not documented.           This feature was added due to problems on Harvard Project.

Extensible Counter Loading & Unloading Utilities

                Design Specification and Overview

                                                       updated: 16 Nov 95
                                                                a-robw

Overview
                                   
Device driver, service and application developers that wish to provide 
performance measuring capability in their software must have a way to 
incorporate the names of the performance counters and counter objects 
into the registry. Currently the only methods available are the manual 
installation of the names into the registry or for each developer to 
devise a scheme to do it programmatically. Since the "correct" way to 
do this is poorly documented and difficult to explain, the following 
utilities and library functions are provided to make the installation
and removal of these extensible counters much simpler and less prone 
to error and confusion.

The two command line utilities provided with Windows NT are shown below.

    > LodCtr MyDriver.INI

    > UnLodCtr MyDriver


LoadPerf.DLL is provided to the software developer to provide access 
to these same functions (in both Unicode & ANSI formats) from within 
a setup program.

    LoadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine
        BOOL    bQuietModeFlag)

    UnloadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine,
        BOOL    bQuietMode)

The contents of the string arguments in the above functions are the
same as those for the command line.
 

The installation utility (LodCtr) accepts as an argument the name of 
the device or application's counter .INI file. The format of the .INI 
file is described in detail later in this document. This utility will 
enter the counter names and explain text stored in the .INI file into 
the corresponding data file and update the necessary keys and values 
for the extensible performance counter DLL.

The removal utility UnLodCtr accepts as an argument, the name of the 
regsistry key which is to have its names removed from the data files.
This key is the registry key that the application, service or device 
driver us using under the ...\Services key and has the Performance
subkey.
 
The extensible performance counter DLL must be written to look up 
the base values of the counter names and explain text during 
initialization for this to function properly.

.INI file format

The .ini file for the extensible performance counter will consist 
of keys and values in a format similar to that of a MS-Windows 
.INI file (e.g. WIN.INI) This will allow a format that is somewhat 
self-documenting as well as allow current Win32 utilities to process 
it and parse the data (e.g. GetPrivateProfileString). A single file 
was selected to minimize the development and maintenance overhead of 
adding or modifying counters and adding foreign language support. 
The contents of the .INI file are described below:


Usage Notes:

The following assumptions are made in the use of counter names and
explain text and should be followed in order to insure predictable and
reliable operation.

    - Index number ranges must not be overlapping between drivers

        The range of index numbers used by an extensible counter 
        must fall between the first and last values (see below).
        (gaps are allowed within the range used). If LodCtr is used
        then this won't be a problem.

    - Names must be assigned to EVEN numbers and Explain text assigned
        to ODD numbers.

        If the convention is followed as shown in the examples below,
        where each item is given an offset of an even number starting 
        from 0, then LodCtr will do the right thing and make this 
        assignment automatically. For this to work, however, the offest 
        values MUST ALWAYS BE EVEN NUMBERS.

    - Manual assignment of counter index values is not recommended.
        
        Failure to follow all the assumptions or manually modifying
        or "hard-coding" index values may result in counter name 
        text corruption or erroneous display of names.

    - Symbol file format must conform to the following:
        
        #define NAME    decimal_number

        The symbol file processor is pretty dumb and can read .H header
        files but will only understand lines that conform to the above
        format. (in line comments after the number are OK) see the
        example below for more information.


// Begin .INI file format

[info]

009=
 .
 .
 .
 .


[text]  // counter & explain text for customer-defined counters
offset_langid_NAME=text
offset_langid_HELP=text

// offset must be a symbolic constant (from symbolfile)
// offset value must be an even number (see code example for why)
// NAME and HELP are literal text and identify counter names or 
// explain text
// langid must be listed as a key under [languages]
// text must be entered on a single line (though it can be a long one)

// end .INI file format


The .ini file must be loaded into the registry before the extensible
performance counter DLL is initialized (e.g. during or immediately 
after the driver is loaded for the first time. Once the counter names 
are loaded, however, they will remain until they are removed or NT is 
reinstalled.


Following is an example of how the various components of an extensible 
counter would incorporate the definitions of the .INI file and the use
of the LodCtr and UnLodCtr utilities.  This example has one object and
two counters.

// begin devdef.H file

// legal constant definitions

#define OBJECT_1    0
#define DEVICE_COUNTER_1    2
#define DEVICE_COUNTER_2    4


// end devdef.H file

// BEGIN: Object & Counter structure initialization file

// defines static structures used to build the perf data that is
// returned by the extensible counter routines

#include "devdef.h"

When LodCtr has loaded the contents of the .INI file the following 
registry keys will have been updated.  The ":" indicates a Value of
a Key; other symbols are keys in the registry.

After UnLodCtr is run to remove a driver's counters from the data file,
the following changes to the registry will take place

------------------------------------------------------

These init files used to be under oakbin for NT1.0.  However, for NT1.0a,
these counter names and help texts are removed from the registry to save size
and improve system performance.  (save 200K bytes of pool paged per language).
The newPerfmon will look for these names in PerfC???.dat and PerfH???.dat inside 
the System32 directory.  If you have to modify any of the ini files, you have to run
a utility to convert them into a data file.  The utility, initodat.exe, is in
sdktools\cntrtext\initodat.  This tool will convert the ini file to dat file 
in the same directory.  You have to move it to the System32 directory after
the conversion.


InitoDat  filename

        Usage:-

        filename is the name of the initialization file that contains
        the counter name definitions or explain text for a specific
        language.  Initodat will create a data file using the same
        name with .dat extension in the current directory.


Please direct any question/comments to either RezaB or a-honwah.

A copy of InitoDat.exe for x86 is included here.  Also, I have converted
all the current ini fiels to dat files, too.
