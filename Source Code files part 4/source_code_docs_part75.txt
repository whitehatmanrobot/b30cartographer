\Quartz\filters\lin21dec\test\HowToUse.txt:


Introduction:
============
This is a short doc on how to use the Test Line21 Source Filter (TSrcL21) to 
test the Line21 Decoder Filter (Lin21Dec).


Purpose:
========
Right now we don't have any line21 data source.  The Test Source filter has
been created to do some preliminary testing of the features and correctness
of the Line21 Decoder filter.  So far it has been very useful and effective
for this purpose.

How It Works:
============
It's simple.  It's a 3 step method.
a) Instantiate a TSrcL21, a Lin21Dec and a Video Renderer in a graph 
   (e.g, using GraphEdt). TSrcL21 asks for a .L21 filename on startup.
b) Connect TSrcL21's output to Lin21Dec's input; then connect Lin21Dec's 
   output to the Video Renderer's input. 
c) Now play, pause, stop -- whatever you want.
Note: TSrcL21 doesn't do seeking.  So when the play send, you have to 
----  reinstantiate TSrcL21 (and specify the .L21 input file name) again and 
      connect the pins.  It may be some work to do seek back to beginning.

.L21 Files:
==========
These files are plain text file to be created using text editors like Edit,
Notepad etc (which put a CR-LF for a lind end).  These files are to be used
as the input to TSrcL21.  By varying the contents of these files a vast
amount test cases can be covered for Lin21Dec.  It's not necessary to write
a lot of code to test Lin21Dec.
Note: There are a few rules about the .L21 files, but imagination is the
----  only limit for the usefulness of this approach.

.L21 Rules:
==========
I had to create a few "rules" or syntax for the input files used for TSrcL21.
1. The first line should be
   #SubType={BytePair|GOPPacket}
   This line indicates to TSrcL21 that the data should be sent down either as
   byte pairs or as GOP packets (as in DVD). Not having this line will cause
   TSrcL21 to have an invalid media type and it won't connect to Lin21Dec.

2. If the SubType on line 1 has been specified as "GOPPacket" then the
   second line should be of the form
   NewPacket n
   where n is an integer in the range 1 to 53 (DVD's max for a packet). Each
   such line indicates the beginning of a new GOP packet of caption chars.
   There can be multiple such packets each starting with a "NewPacket n" line.
   For subtype "BytePair", this line should not be used.

3. The text chars are to be typed in as it is with a max of 32 chars per 
   line.  It's a good test case to have more than 32 chars on a line as 
   Lin21Dec should handle that right.

4. The control chars, special chars etc are in the range 10 hex to 7f hex.
   So they are put in [ ] to distinguish them from a normal number. A control
   char pair [14 20] has to be used to indicate that the caption mode is
   Pop-on.

There are a bunch of .L21 files checked in in the 
\quartz\filters\lin21dec\test\data dir.  Take a look at them to get an idea
of how these files should be created. Use these files as input to create
filter graphs and play them back.  See the correspondence between the control
chars and color/font/mode etc change in the displayed caption.

Finally:
=======
You need to read about 10 pages of doc on Closed Captioning.  I have a copy
of the doc 
"Closed Caption Decoder Requirements from FCC Report and Order FCC 91-119".
This is the minimum you will need to know to create meaningful L21 files
for testing Lin21Dec.  If you get more interested in it, you can also raed
EIA-608, but it's a pin-in-the-****.  So try avoiding it if you can.


Feedback:
========
Please let me know of any problem/concerns/requirements/... whatever (praise
is fine too :-).

There should be 3 new property pages entitled  Quality VideoPort , and  Positions .  In addition to that, there should be a number of input pin configuration pages.  The title of these pages is made up by concatenating  Config  and the name of each input pins.   Quality page shows various quality statistics that the Overlay Mixer sees.  If a hardware decoder is used, Overlay Mixer will not able to see any frames, thus all entries on this pages will be zeros.  Numbers on this page do not update themselves automatically.  One has to close the property page and reopen in order to see the numbers updated by time.  This is due to the limitation of CQualityProperties that was written for Video Renderer.   VideoPort page shows video port information if Overlay Mixer uses the video port as the render transport when a hardware decoder is used.  If a software decoder is used, and Overlay Mixer uses overlay as the render transport, all entries on this page will be zeros.  Information on this page is grouped by the various video port data structures.  This page is designed for viewing video port capabilities and connection information for hardware decoders. Positions page shows 2 sets of source and destination rectangles.  The first set is from the primary input pin.  In the case of overlay transport, these rectangles are returned from IOverlay of the primary input pin.  In the case of video port transport, they are returned from IVPObject of the primary input pin.  The second set is returned from IBasicVideo of the filter connected to the output pin.  Of these rectangles, only the destination rectangle of the primary input pin is in the screen coordinate space.  All others are in their own relative coordinate space. Input pin configuration pages contain and control configuration of individual input pins.  Aspect ratio mode, key color and transparency are parameters that the user can set, of which aspect ratio mode and key color are implemented as of now.   Depending on the aspect radio mode set, the Overlay Mixer should either stretch, center or crop the video image.  By setting the key color, one should see that color momentarily as the background before the video starts (mostly likely one won t see it at all on a windows machine).  If one is running on an NT machine, and the window moves continuously as one moves the window, one should see that color as the background as the video window.  Other information on the page include relation position which should always be [0, 0, 10000, 10000], and rectangles from current connection s media types.   One can also right click on the input pins to get their configuration property pages.  The pages should also show up in MediaPlayer, although because of the order of the functions being called to add the pages to the sheet, the input pin configuration pages  titles are not constructed correctly.

Introduction:

Current the only way one can use hardware motion compensation is through Overlay mixer filter.  Hence one has to write a filter to interact with overlay mixer and it, in turn, calling proper DirectDraw function and finally the display driver. 

This is a sample filter which shows how to use hardware motion compensation in video decoder.  It is intend to supply VGA manufactory with basic shell to do their driver testing through overlay mixer.  Current this filter disregard the input sample and calling overlay mixer without any valid data.  

What you need:

1. Hardware Motion Comp GUIDs should replace CLSID_TESTMOCOMP1 and CLSID_TESTMOCOMP2
2. Proper decoded video data

MPEG1 packet player
-------------------

See mpegdef.h for definitions of values.

The MPEG1 packet player is a filter supporting:

    IFilter
    IMediaFilter

This filter has class id CLSID_Mpeg1PacketPlayer.

Media types
-----------

It supports 2 input pins which accept the following 2 media types
respectively:

    Major type         Subtype                         Props
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    MEDIATYPE_Audio    MEDIASUBTYPE_Mpeg1PacketAudio   None
    MEDIATYPE_Video    MEDIASUBTYPE_Mpeg1PacketVideo   Default video props

These 2 pins accept samples (see ISO11172) which contain a packet()
format data (starting with a packet_start_code) and stream ids
consistent with audio and video streams respectively.  Each sample
start must start with the a packet_start_code


There is 1 output pin (connected to the renderer?) supporting the
following media type:


    Major type         Subtype                   Props
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    MEDITTYPE_Video    MEDIATYPE_NULL            Default video props

The input pin of the renderer must support IOverlayWindow.

Filter properties
-----------------



Timing
------

The first packet received after going into 'Paused' from 'inactive' state MUST
have a PTS.  This PTS (pts(0)) will is saved.  When 'Run' is issued
we have 3 numbers:

    The time stamp on the first smaple - ts(1)
    The current time                   - ts(2)

We must set the STC to pts(0) - (ts(1) - ts(2)) - all in appropriate
units.  This will cause the first sample to be presented the right
time after the play starts.

While playing we must maintain the different between the STC and
the current time - which we will also remember.

While paused we have to count the time Paused and add it to the
STC, Reference clock time difference.

The ability to synch the stream to the system clock will be
determined by how frequently we get packets with PTSs in them because
we'll set the STC on a per sample basis.

The client can change the synch by changing the sample start times.


When the device is held open
----------------------------

For now this be be whenever the output overlay pin is connected.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\multimedia\dshow\filters\mpeg1\packet\design.txt ===
This project creates a filter for playing MPEG video.  It uses the Mpeg...
APIs defined by ACT (mpegapi.h) for their MPEG drivers to implement the filter(s).

The ACT drivers take the packet layer (whole packets include PTS etc).  It
looks therefore like a media sample MUST contain (a set of) whole packets.

The ACT kernel drivers swallow a PMPEG_PACKET_LIST structure whole, each
one of these contains packets for both audio and video.  In particular
MpegWriteData gets passed

-- a count of packets.
-- a PMPEG_PACKET_LIST parameter.
-- a stream type

so in fact each queued request is for a specific device.

However, there is only one device queue so if the audio and video
gets out of synch in terms of delivery then data wanting to play may
queue unnecessarily.

Filters
-------

For this model, to play mpeg system stream we need a filter to split the system
layer and present packets to the driver as implemented by these APIs.

Though we're going to choose a filter with a single input and output pin
we're not going to use CTransformFilter because:

1.  This is not flexible enough.
2.  Our requests are not completed synchronously.

The 'driver' filter can have several possible modes of operation depending on
the device capabilities:

    Render to overlay device (need separate overlay filter device too)
    Decompress/?Compress to memory.

These caps apply to audio and video which are treated separately.  In this
sense a device which supports audio and video will be treated as 2 filters
by us - then tied together by using the same hdevice.


Filter model
------------

There are actually 3 filter models we can adopt:


1.
                                       ----------------
          ------------                |                |
         |            |        o------  Audio renderer  ------o
         |             ------o        |                |
   o-----   Splitter  |                ----------------
         |             ------o         ----------------
         |            |               |                |
          ------------         o------  Video filter    ------o
                                      |                |
                                       ----------------

2.  Same as 1. but the audio and video are part of a single filter with
    two pins (so we can distinguish video from audio).

3.  A single filter with a single input and output which combines splitting
    with rendereing.

We will do number 2 (splitter + filter with 2 input pins).
sources of mpeg packet layer audio and video than the splitter, but maybe
we can have different splitters depeding one whether we're real time or
whatever.  Actually Alistair says he knows of 3 'system' layers.

The input pins will support (in the first design) the following media
types respectively:

1.  Mpeg1 audio packet data (ie just the data, not the packets).
2.  Mpeg1 video packet data.

If our driver supports decompression then other output pins could be
supported.  The Mpeg api supplied by ACT does not currently allow this.

How do we stop the audio filter rendering?  Maybe have a diffenent
class id for the non-render version, or connect and audio output pin to
ground, or just don't send the audio?  The current answer is that
we will support 2 class ids (when necessary) - one for (de)compression
and one for being an audio renderer.  This means we need different filters
for the audio and video because one is a renderer and one isn't.

A reason for having just one filter is it's going to be hard to
pause half of an MPEG hardware device (just for instance).


Overlay
-------

Setting the mask is controlled by DCI.

Note (horrible) setting up the overlay is controlled by the overlay
device so I suppose we need to keep this open?

What happens here is:

1.  We say we support a mediatype of MediaType_OverlayWindow
2.  We get IOverlayWindow off the renderer's input pin.
3.  We register our IOverlayWindowNotify interface.
    The initial overlay position is set (even when inactive)
    based on calling GetClipList or SetChromKey or whatever.
    The renderer will tell us (how?) when it's visible.
4.  We adjust the overlay position based on the notifications if
    we're bitmapped (or the renderer does the painting with the
    chromakey?).

5.  In the case of chromakey we still need to know where the window
    is so we'll need to hook callbacks.

What's kind of weird is that the window is owned by the renderer but
the overlay hardware is owned by us so we'd better be talking about the
same display surface (eg on the same machine)!

Display modes
-------------

If the display mode is wrong the Mpeg apis will reject our calls (how?)
and we'll have to refuse to start etc etc.

Palettes
--------
Do we need to worry or are all our devices going to be true colour?

Synchronization and timing
--------------------------

(For now) we'll get our reference clock from IMediaSample::SetSyncSource.
When we get a packet (list) for rendering we'll adjust the system time
clock based on:

1.  The current reference clock.
2.  The current STC.
3.  The FIRST packet SCR.

And we'll try and maintain a constant relationship between the STC and
the current reference clock.

So:

1.  At start of play (paused->playing) we'll queue up some stuff and note
the first PTS (can the hardware be paused so it can have decoded stuff
ready to go?  I hope so).  The remember diff = PTS - ref clock.  On
Run() set the STC to PTS and unpause.

2.  On each packet query the STC and reference clock and reset the STC based
on being a slave to the reference clock.

Resource management
-------------------

Resources are basically determined by how much we can queue up on the
kernel mode driver

Yes, and we'll have a self-imposed limit - how do we determine this?
For wave drivers it was a (fixed) guess.

When the resource limit is reached we'll basically wait until a buffer
completes.

This means that there is a lot hanging on the amount we should queue.  It
should probably be a time-based limit.  If we queue too much we hit the disk
reader etc.

The model is that we return from GetBuffer() ... until we've either

a.  Passed the buffer to the MPEG api. OR
b.  Been deactivated.

BUT if we're in paused state we just give a bad return when we can't
queue up any more.

Currently buffers must be of fixed size (!).  This seems a bit bad
and in our case they must therefore be 65536 bytes (max size of
packet) at least so we have to provide our own allocator.

This means we must provide the allocator.

The splitter will use the system layer info to decide on a reasonable
buffer size and request this size from our allocator (which for now
we'll just say OK to).

Internal synchronization
------------------------

The filter will have a single critical section.  This is NEVER
held when an API is called which might block but is held at all
other times (?).

In addition there is an event object owned by the filter to
signal a state change from another thread when a thread is
waiting.  The state change APIs must have their own critical section
(ie the state has a critical section?) since they obviously want
to be able to change the state

In fact it turns out we must have a thread to pump the MPEG device.
This is because the implementation of GetBuffer() must synchronize
with the current state (critical section) but the resources must
not be freed until we are really inactive.  OR ... what about
a reference count on the playing resources (or when the STOPPED
event is signalled THEN we release everything).

Management of mpeg api
----------------------

This API only has events as notifications so we must have a single
event per buffer.  We'll keep a list of which ones are 'outstanding'
and just call MpegQueryAsyncResult(wait) on the first one (we sent
last) when we're asked for a new one and there are none free.

(Video) Render target
---------------------

If the renderer (ie the filter connected to the video output pin)
does not support IMediaWindow then we must render to memory
if we can.  If we can't then just refuse the pin connect.

Similarly for the audio (is it still IMediaWindow?).  We get the audio
properties etc from the IMediaWindow?  Otherwise we have to render to memory.
Or should we just be the audio renderer (what does a renderer have to support)?

Finding the right device
------------------------

There's a logical problem that once the splitter has split the streams we'd
like them both to be rendered by the same card.  This might ultimately be
dictated by making sure the 'location' of the outputs is the same (but then
this won't always be the case?).  This would be much simpler if we supported
either a splitter or a splitter+renderer filter and possibly some codecs to
generate PCM and bitmaps or something.

The mpeg video apis identify objects by device index.  We need to try to make
sure that stuff playing from the same source goes through the same card. In
general if 2 filters are running off the same filter graph at least their time
stamps should be in synch so we can play them.  What we should effectively do
is never play more than one filter graph at a time on a single card and make
sure we match streams from a single filter graph to the same card.  This last
bit means we must be in a filter graph before we get asked about the pins, or
else we have to postpone the decision about which mpeg card to use until
we're asked to play.

Note that it could be a function of something else to make sure the same 'device'
plays the data if possible but then because we're emulating we 'find' all
the devices at once.

Worker thread
-------------

This thread handles packet queueing and sending IO to the real device
(MpegWriteDevice).  There is 1 queue per logical device.

The waits are WaitForMultipleObjects with 1 event per stream and
the worker request event - all are Manual Reset so we don't miss stuff.
The return code tells us what to do - either complete 1 request from the
stream queue, receive a new packet or terminate.

When the thread terminates this terminates all IO (courtesy of the IO
subsystem).  Calling Free() on the streams frees all the queues.



Format negotiation
------------------

The input format contains the size of the video and the source rectangle
(usually the whole video).  This will be proposed as the output format in
the normal way - but we don't want a DIB section but we won't request
the allocator from the renderer (make sure the base class doesn't!).


Properties
----------

We should support the relevant property interfaces.  What do we
do about audio mixer controls?

Note on resources
-----------------

Because real resources are involved here (well usually - ie the
hardware) we need some way of resolving resource conflicts (eg
trying to drive the same hardware to do compression and rendering
at the same time when it's not allowed).

The current religion on this is that conficts are OK between
separate filter graphs so what we really (may) need is the ability
to enumerate instances of ourselves in the same filter graph to
avoid conflicts.  This is not currently addressed here.

In any case for the current design we should not pop up twice in
the same filter graph.  Because a single device (audio and video)
can only be opened once through the ACT APIs multiple filters can
run on the same device at once and the driver will cope with
contention.

Basic design
------------

Components
----------

Filter

   CMpeg1PacketFilter

2 input pins (video and audio)

   CMpeg1PacketInputPin

1 output pin (handles overlay)

   CMpeg1Overlay

Shared handle to mpeg driver

   CMpegDevice

dual streams for mpeg driver

   CMpeg1DeviceStream

2 allocators - one for each pin

   CMpeg1StreamAllocator

   This is NOT based on CBaseAllocator because we'll have our own
   synchronization mechanisms.



Setup
-----

The driver will be a set of filter objects which will be composed into
suitable objects by a mapping layer.

The filter objects will be:

CMpeg1SystemSplitter - 1 input pin and 2 output pins.  Splits Mpeg1 system
layer.

CMpeg1DeviceRenderer

    Members

         m_AudioRenderer
         m_VideoRenderer


CMpeg1AudioPacketRender

CMpeg1VideoPacketRender

CMpeg1AudioPacketDecompress

CMpeg1VideoPacketDecompress


Issues
------

When connecting up the overlay we want to register for callbacks after
everything's been agreed - so do we need a 'complete connect'?  For
now we're setting everything up on CheckConnect (and not even checking
any media types!).


Where do we get the clock from?  I assume we get the reference clock from the
filter graph but that we can't be the reference clock?

Where do we negotiate the window size and position (alignment)? - from
IMediaWindow on the renderer.

See 'Note on resources'.

What about 'preroll' (time < 0) - just do it for now until our buffers
are full - does this mean just pausing the real device and sending it everything
we've got - won't that mess up the clock or something?

When is this filter available?  Answer should really be where there is
at least one Mpeg driver (MpegEnum... returns something).  Fortunately
at least all Mpeg drivers are going to output their video to the screen
so the destination thing isn't quite so bad as for audio.

If we have separate input pins for different Mpeg streams (audio and
video) is there a problem that the data could arrive out of (time)
sequence, or can the device cope with this?

GetBuffer() queueing.  The problem is that things may be OK when
you 'get' the buffer but NOT when you want to send, so the device
may get into some awkward queueing states.  Note that Decommit() is
the way to get the buffer back.

If we create a thread to pump the mpeg driver we can avoid waiting
in InputPin::Receive().  If not and we can't queue the buffer we really have
to wait for one to become free (maybe with a timeout if it's a quota
problem).

We only play 1 audio and 1 video stream at a time (!!).  We should
design to support CreatePin() to play multiple?  This would involve
being truly flexible about streams.

We rely on being State_Inactive when

Notes
-----

The source filter must give us the video size as part of the media type
(can it change in the stream?) - so it must parse the video sequence header.

When we start a stream we need to be sure we're at the start of a real
frame etc.  The source filter must ensure this.  If we get inactivated
the src filter must be informed - but how?

EOS and splicing - we don't want to specify EOS on the current packet
unless we know the next packet has a different STC.  What would be
slightly better is if the EOS notification contained an STC value
to set.  We could then queue up more data with a much smaller glitch.

In the MPEG api stuff we have to open the mpeg device to determine its capabilities.
Additionally we only get the devices back by enumeration and it's not clear whether
device ids or caps related to those ids are stable over time.  I think we
need something much more dynamic than that - devnode / MRID identification should
help here.

How to we make sure that a single MPEG stream ends up on the same device (ie
not audio and video sent to different cards?).  Is this by making sure the
rederers are different for different cards but the 'same' for the same card??

Not sure whether the MPEG stuff assumes that the device can only be opened
once or not.  In any case - either the Open should cope with multiple opens
or there should be another way of determining capabilities etc.

Decommit may take a while to complete if there are buffers still playing -
should this initiate a pause?  In this case we return from the commit but
don't allow a 'SetSize'.  When all buffers complete (or when we detect they
do since we have no thread monitoring them!) we finish the decommit.  In
this state in the allocator m_Committed is FALSE but m_pBuffer is non-null.
We don't allow decommit if the client is still holding on to buffers.

Note that in the allocator buffers can get into a number of awkward states
because they can be Release()'d at a random moment.  Consequently we
MUST NOT reuse buffers until they are Release()'d.


The ACT stuff has the SyncVideoToAudio which allows 2 streams to have
offset PTS's.  We could do this by using the PTS cum sample time to
look for differences and set the difference.  Not sure how this is
related to just setting them independently though??  It's possible
we should call this instead of setting the individual clocks.

We would like to 'pass the device around' to the active window - but
that's not currently possible.  One possiblity would be to open the
kernel driver multiple times and 'seize' the device with the cooperation
of the driver if you become the active window.

Should the kernel driver reserve some quota up front and allocate it
privately to get reliable throughput?

Comments on current ACT drivers
-------------------------------

1.  They should support the mixer API at least.

2.  The port driver is having to guess all the private driver settings in
    order to pull them out and present them to the driver (so I presume
    they are also in some kind of public structure).  Better to let
    the driver ask for properties by name for a given instance.

3.  Said before - but you shouldn't have to open the device for exclusive
    use just to get its caps.

4.  They should use DCI to update the clipping for mask type overlays.
    (any evidence they don't?).

5.  They only support 2 streams.  So (eg) they could not play 2 audio
    streams (not sure this would be sensible) or pass data, karaoke etc
    I THINK.  At any rate they only support 1 stream per TYPE.  This
    is not really a problem for MPEG1 which only supports 1 id for
    audio and 1 for video.

6.  The port driver ought to validate lengths better or use a try ... except
    while parsing a packet list.  Actually this is probably mainly done
    by MpIoctlVideoWritePackets.

7.  Should they have 2 device queues - one for audio and one for video?  Or
    can they remove it by key?  Actually the do have 2 device objects so
    it's OK.  This means we could manage both streams separately.

8.  Card specific information in player (ie mpegtest tests which card it
    is in order to decide what to do).

9.  Do they use the Scr field in the packet list?

10. They should call DisableLibraryThreadCalls in their Dll init.

11. Is the API synchronized for multiple threads?

12. The kernel driver doesn't seem to do anything with the SCR value
    in the MPEG_PACKET_LIST structure.

13. mpegtest waits on all buffers for completion - is this necessary?
    Can they complete the wrong wait first?

14. Need the device open to control the volume so can't use mixer app!

15. (v minor) MPEG_PACKET_LIST should point to a LPCVOID, not LPVOID and
    the structures themselves should be const.

16. No way to change the clock on a packet basis?  We want to switch
    time base seamlessly when the 'next' packet enters the decoder,
    so the app needs to sync the time change to the packet, not call
    it separately.

17. Might be nice to do the overlay mask thing in bands (rather than
    allocate the whole thing?).  Would be interesting to know what
    the hardware interface is on (eg) matrox.

18. What do MpegSetOverlaySource and MpegSetOverlayDestination do
    when the coordinates are negative or all outside the screen?
    (note that MPEG_OVERLAY_PLACEMENT seems undefined - maybe its
     used in the IOCTLs).

    Well, MpegSetOverlaySource is not supported (!),
    MpegSetOverlayDestination just casts the LONGs to ULONGs - this
    is pretty crummy.

19. What do we do if we're asked to display the overlay (by clipping
    change) but we can't open the device?

20. To synchronize clocks with a real clock the best thing to do would be to
    pass a delta from the system clock to the kernel.  This will be taken
    care of when we do our own drivers because the kernel driver (filter)
    will be passed a marshalled pointer to the ref clock - thus we need
    to be sure of having a kernel implementation of ref clocks.

21. The audio on (eg) the marvel2 appears never to set the hardware ref
    clock, rather it just works out what the STC is as a delta from
    the hardware ref clock.  This is going to make it difficult to
    synchronize with an external source!  In this case we need a caps
    field to know this is the case.

22. Why can't the PTS be part of the MPEG_PACKET_LIST structure?  After
    all the Scr is already in there.  This way we could avoid passing
    the packet headers which just confuse downstream guys.

dbgpages.ax NOTES

**************************************************

    This is a property page designed explicitly for debugging issues internal
to KsProxy, AVStream, ks.sys, etc...  In order to use this, you must build
a private version of ksproxy.ax which defines DEBUG_PROPERTY_PAGES and 
regsvr32 the built version of dbgpages.ax.  Note that proppage.dll must also
be registered in order for this to work properly.

    Each proxied pin will have a property page "Debug Pipes" which will show
the proxy's internal pipes configuration for a pin, the DShow allocator
properties for the assigned allocator, and the kernel pin's allocator framing
properties.  Note that if two proxied pins are connected, due to an odd
behavior in graphedt, you will get property pages for **BOTH** when you click
properties of one of them.  The first property page is that of the connected
pin and the second is that of the pin you clicked properties on.  This is 
due to the pin property implementation in graphedt.

========================================================================
       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : winlog
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this winlog application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your winlog application.

winlog.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CWinlogApp application class.

winlog.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CWinlogApp.

winlog.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Developer Studio.

res\winlog.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file winlog.rc.

res\winlog.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 
	Developer Studio.  You should place all resources not
	editable by the resource editor in this file.

winlog.clw
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For the main frame window:

MainFrm.h, MainFrm.cpp
    These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from
    CFrameWnd and controls all SDI frame features.

res\Toolbar.bmp
    This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar.
    The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the
    CMainFrame class.  Edit this toolbar bitmap along with the
    array in MainFrm.cpp to add more toolbar buttons.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one document type and one view:

winlogDoc.h, winlogDoc.cpp - the document
    These files contain your CWinlogDoc class.  Edit these files to
    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading
    (via CWinlogDoc::Serialize).

winlogView.h, winlogView.cpp - the view of the document
    These files contain your CWinlogView class.
    CWinlogView objects are used to view CWinlogDoc objects.



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named winlog.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is 
in a language other than the operating system's current language, you
will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC40XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC40DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.

Based on CBaseAllocator. Does not allocate any memory.  Use SetParent() to point it at a cache buffer that owns it. Use SetCBuffersReported to lie about this number as it will be an arbitrarily large number. Useful if the downstream filter will try to allocate that much if it is copying data. CRecCache Maintains cache of buffers and reserve buffers. GetBuffer does not block. Pretends to be an IMemAllocator for IAsyncReader. Returns to semaphores for caller to wait on for available buffer. CRecBuffer buffers used above. CBaseMSRInPin Input pin. Notifies filter when there is a connection. Accepts anything with IAsyncReader. Calls CBaseMSRFilter::CheckMediaType to accept. CBaseMSRFilter The Filter. Creates output pins and removes them on connect/disconnect of the input pin.

Constraints Currently, the file writer does not handle MIDI. Streams are not synchronized in the output file; samples are output in the order received. Streams will be recorded at a constant rate. Platform Dependencies Relies on Win32 API calls. Tests whether CreateIoCompletionPort() succeeds to determine whether asynchronous I/O can be used. Internationalization Does regQuartz media type contain language information? Currently, the language field in the AVI file is set to 0. Future versions Error recovery. Handle out of disk space errors by truncating the file and leaving it in a consistent state. Coalescing. Copying small data streams (small audio bytes, text, RIFF headers) on the end of other samples. Coalescing. Is there any point in coalescing large chunks by programming the allocator to return adjacent blocks of memory for successive samples which could be written in one write operation? 500k is a good target size, but video capture case is optimal only with use of the source filter s allocator. Aborts (Adobe) Testing Functionality Testing Features tested by creating a Quartz graph in GraphEdit which uses that feature/code path. Compatibility Testing Compatibility with existing AVI readers. Output files were tested with MediaPlayer in Windows NT 3.51 and with the MCI AVI player. Performance Testing Performance as a percentage of disk bandwidth on a particular Windows NT system. Error condition testing Errors propagate up. Each has been tested, but more work is needed. Deadlock Potentials, if any Each pin calls the filter; the filter serializes calls. The file I/O worker thread blocks on the Completion port. The filter side blocks on an event from the worker thread.

Use these filters to output an AVI file containing the data received on the input pins. This document assumes knowledge of Quartz and the AVI file format. Feature Description The file writer filter can be replaced with a component which writes to a stream in a compound document. The AVImux is the file type specific component. The AVIMux outputs a file in the new AVI file format with a two level index. It can be configured to output a file compatible with existing AVI readers. The AVImux accepts any number of inputs, up to the limit of the AVI file format. Each input stream corresponds to one AVI stream. These filters are designed to achieve a high throughput for video capture to a pre-allocated file. To maximize disk bandwith utilization, the filter uses unbuffered, asynchronous disk writes (if available) without seeking when running. Interleave streams for efficient and streaming playback. End User Benefits The filter can be used to record a video editing session (eg a filter in an ISVs video editing system). Video capture (ISVs and end users). Implementation Assumptions File Writer Filename set through IFileSinkFilter::SetFileName and can be changed when graph stopped  When the file writer is given a filename, it changes the values reported to GetAllocatorRequirements to match the sector sizes and requests a reconnect upstream. The filewriter currently does not provide an allocator. The filewriter writes samples as they arrive in the Paused and Running states. The file writer uses IMemInputPin to transport data. The stream times on samples (GetTime()) represent byte offsets. The filewriter refuses samples with S_FALSE after it encounters an error or EndOfStream. The filewriter signals errors to the graph using NotifyEvent. The filewriter may do this after returning from Receive and accepting additional samples. The filewriter writes all samples it has accepted when it is stopped with IMediaFilter::Stop and refuses any new samples. It blocks the Stop() call until it commits all samples to disk but it may signal the graph (EC_COMPLETE) earlier. The input pin of the filewriter exports IStream and supports a subset of its methods. These are available even when the graph is stopped. Release the interface to close the file handle. No sector or memory alignment requirements are negotiated for IStream. On Windows95, the file writer queues writes on a separate thread. The IMemInputPin::Receive() call can block on both Windows95 and Windows NT. AVIMux The AVIMux creates a variable number of input pins supporting IMemInputPin and one output pin using both IStream and IMemInputPin. Accepts any stream with MajorType in the FOURCCMap space. Samples with negative time stamps are discarded. Audio streams are handled specially, all other streams are handled like video (frame based) Video streams should have the nAvgTimePerFrame entry set in VIDEOINFO structure of the format block. It is used to determine which frames were dropped by the source. Initial frames: AVIMux records start times of all streams, normalizes streams so earliest stream starts at t=0 then normalizes all streams so that first video stream starts on a frame boundary. AVIMux reconnects input pins when the output pin is reconnected to renegotiate alignment requirements. GetAllocatorRequirements() on input pins reports a prefix of 8 and alignment from File writer. The prefix is used to reserve space for the RIFF headers. AVIMux generally issues one write per sample using IMemInputPin downstream. In NotifyAllocator(), the AVIMux determines if samples on a stream need to be copied. Data must be not be read-only and must have the requested alignment and prefix. The AVIMux does not negotiate a suffix on input streams  allocators (for RIFF/AVI   chunks). If it s using an upstream allocator, the AVImux may issue two writes   one write for the data, and one sector for padding. All this goes away if the AVIMux is using buffered I/O.  Restrictions Time elapsed in any stream will not exceed xxx. Number of samples in any stream will not exceed xxx. (this can be detected). This is determined by the amount of space preallocated at startup for the index. Size of sample will not exceed xxx. (this can be detected) Will not exceed maximum number of pending asynchronous file requests. some of the stuff below is obsolete Design Details The following classes are defined: CFileIo, CImperfectBufIo, CAviWrite, CAviDest, CAviInput, CAviAllocator. CFileIo The CFileIo class encapsulates the interface to file I/O. It supports writing in buffered (through the operating system), unbuffered, synchronous and asynchronous modes. The implementation uses a separate thread that waits on a Win32 completion port to process asynchronous events. The caller specifies a callback to call when an asynchronous write completes. CFileIo maintains a fixed size pool of WriteRequest objects which contain OVERLAPPED structures necessary for completion ports. CFileIo handles the different file access modes by creating two handles to the file; one file handle is used for buffered, synchronous I/O, the other for unbuffered, asynchronous I/O. If an error is detected (during the completion event), a flag is set and subsequent writes will fail. All calls should be serialized by the caller. Public methods: BOOL SetMaxPendingRequests(ULONG cRequests); Set the count of outstanding write requests. This corresponds to the number of buffers the caller has allocated. BOOL Create(); Create() creates the file and starts the worker thread. SetMaxPendingRequests() needs to should be called before. BOOL StreamingStart(ULONGLONG ibFile); Start streaming at ibFile, which must be aligned, in the file. StreamingGetFilePointer(), StreamingSeek(), and SreamingWrite() calls can be issued in streaming mode. BOOL StreamingEnd(); Ends streaming mode. Blocks until all pending writes complete. BOOL StreamingGetFilePointer(ULONGLONG *pibFile); BOOL StreamingSeek(ULONG cbSeek); BOOL StreamingWrite(   BYTE *pbData,   DWORD cbData,   FileIoCallback fnCallback,   void *pMisc); StreamingWrite() issues an asynchronous write and calls fnCallback on completion or error. pMisc is an argument passed to the callback. pbData, and dwSize must be aligned on the boundaries returned in GetMemReq() below. The write operation fails if a previous write failed. Under Windows, this call blocks until the write operation completes. BOOL Close(); Close() closes the file and the worker thread, and resets its internal state. Can only be called when not streaming (ie StreamingEnd() was called). BOOL SynchronousWrite(   DWORDLONG dwlPos,   BYTE *pbData,   DWORD dwSize); BOOL SynchronousRead(   DWORDLONG dwlPos,   BYTE *pbData,   DWORD dwSize); void GetMemReq(   ULONG* pAlignment,   ULONG *pcbPrefix,   ULONG *pcbSuffix); Returns the alignment requirements for write  and seek operations. static void NullCallback(void *pMisc); CImperfectBufIo The CImperfectBufIo class uses the same interface as CFileIo, but reports an alignment of 1 and copies incoming samples to a larger buffer. The benefits are that no space is wasted in JUNK chunks and performance can better than the operating system s own buffering. The buffering is imperfect because the class may write over the data in the file before and after a streaming write. This behavior is acceptable in the AVI file writer because thesamples are the first thing to be written in streaming mode. CAviWrite The CAviWrite class encapsulates all the specifics of the AVI file format. On startup, CAviWrite prepares the file for streaming and on shutdown it fills in the structures omitted. RIFF structure The AVI header is maintained in memory as the on disk structure and is output to disk when the file is closed (on the pause to stop transition). Keeping the structure in memory as it is on disk requires padding (  chunks) to ensure all the structures are aligned on 32 bit DWORDs. The AVI format only guarantees that structures are aligned on 16 bit WORDS. AVI chunks that are not aligned on 16 bit words can be aligned for free (no junk chunks). CAviWrite expects incoming samples to be aligned on DWORDs or CFileIo s requirments, whichever is greater. Each sample must be padded on either size. The padding in front of the sample is used for the RIFF chunk header. The padding at the back is used for a JUNK chunk needed to pad the file to sector boundaries. Options The Avi file writer supports the following options through registry entries in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\ Software\\Microsoft\\Multimedia\\AviWriterFilter cbSubIndex cbSuperIndex cbOuterRiff: Size of the outermost RIFF chunks. Should be 1 Gb to remain compatible with older AVI file readers. cbHeaderJunk: amount of junk left in the header after the   junk for editing. cbBuffer cBuffers bBufferedIo Incoming data A StreamInfo structure is used to keep track of all of the per-stream information including a copy of the MediaType structure, necessary to compute stream rates, sample counts, etc. This structure is updated for each sample received. For each sample: When each sample received, it is written to disk indexed (possibly triggering a write) the size of the outermost RIFF chunk is checked (possibly increasing the file s seek offset if a new RIFF chunk must be started). the first chunk is a special case because space needs to be left for the old style index. Index The super index and the current sub-index for each stream are kept in memory. The CAviAllocator allocator is used to allocate buffers for the subindex chunks. When a subindex is filled, it is output at the current position in the file and a new one is allocated. This means the index is after the data it indexes. When the file is closed, the sub indexes are propagated up, one stream at a time, so that the index chunk is before the data it indexes. During the initialization step, space is allocated for the first subindex chunks at the very beginning of the   chunk. This space may be  junked  if there is one subindex, and it fits in the space allocated for the superindex. During the propagation step, the old format index (idx1) is constructed. The CWalkIndex class is used to read index entries and propagate subindex chunks. Public methods CAviWrite(TCHAR *szName); void GetMemReq(ULONG* pAlignment, ULONG *pcbPrefix, ULONG *pcbSuffix); Return CAviWrite s requirements on incoming samples. BOOL Initialize(int cPins, MediaType **rgpMt, ULONG *rgcBuffer); Initialize CAviWrite, create the output file, and prepare to receive samples. rgpMt is an array of pointser to media types for the connected pins (NULL if the pin is not connected). rgcBuffer is an array containing the number of buffers allocated on the pin's allocator. BOOL Close(); HRESULT Receive(int pinNum, IMediaSample *pSample); Each sample is written through this method. Calls from the different pins are serialized at the filter. static FOURCC MpVideoGuidSubtype_Fourcc(const GUID *pGuidSubtype); Maps media subtype to a FOURCC code for the AVI file; returns 0 if mapping is unknown. CAviDest The CAviDest class implements the filter and behaves like a rendering filter. It inherits CBaseMediaFilter and IFileSourceFilter. On startup, the filter creates one output pin. If a pin reports that it is connected,  and there are no more free pins, the filter creates a new pin. The filter initializes and closes CAviWrite on stop -> pause and pause -> stop transitions. The filter does not distinguish between the paused and stopped states; it is the source filter's responsibility. Much of the pin's behavior is routed through the filter. In particular, receives are serialized at the filter. CAviDest::CAviInput The CAviDestInput class implements the input pin. It accepts any stream which can be put in an AVI file as determined by MpVideoGuidSubtype_Fourcc.  When a connection is made or broken, it notifies the filter so that the filter can create another pin. When a stream reports EndOfStream(), and there are no more active streams, a pin notifies the filter that the run is complete. Allocator The pin would like to use the source filter's allocator as this saves a memory copy.  In order to use the source filter's allocator, the input pin checks that it meets the size, alignment, and padding requirements set at pin creation. The pin is responsible for copying the sample to its own allocator if it cannot use the source filter's. Data structures Data Flow Sample Code Use the  sample code  style for sample code. Dependencies Relies on certain behavior of base classes. Johnkn s aviriff.h. Constraints Currently, the file writer does not handle MIDI. Streams are not synchronized in the output file; samples are output in the order received. Streams will be recorded at a constant rate. Platform Dependencies Relies on Win32 API calls. Tests whether CreateIoCompletionPort() succeeds to determine whether asynchronous I/O can be used. Internationalization Does regQuartz media type contain language information? Currently, the language field in the AVI file is set to 0. Future versions Error recovery. Handle out of disk space errors by truncating the file and leaving it in a consistent state. Coalescing. Copying small data streams (small audio bytes, text, RIFF headers) on the end of other samples. Coalescing. Is there any point in coalescing large chunks by programming the allocator to return adjacent blocks of memory for successive samples which could be written in one write operation? 500k is a good target size, but video capture case is optimal only with use of the source filter s allocator. Aborts (Adobe) Testing Functionality Testing Features tested by creating a Quartz graph in GraphEdit which uses that feature/code path. Compatibility Testing Compatibility with existing AVI readers. Output files were tested with MediaPlayer in Windows NT 3.51 and with the MCI AVI player. Performance Testing Performance as a percentage of disk bandwidth on a particular Windows NT system. Error condition testing Errors propagate up. Each has been tested, but more work is needed. Deadlock Potentials, if any Each pin calls the filter; the filter serializes calls. The file I/O worker thread blocks on the Completion port. The filter side blocks on an event from the worker thread.

Introduction Dexter is a system for editing various bits of different media together from different sources, including doing mixing and special effects and transitions for audio and video data types.  It consists of several parts.  At the lowest level, there is a collection of filters that can be put together in a DirectShow filtergraph, and specially programmed to accomplish any editing task desired (the FILTER COLLECTION).   There is also a high level API, where an app can specify at a very high level what editing task is to be performed, such as "this piece of video dissolves to this other piece of video, and a third comes in from the side" and this information can be stored and retrieved  (The TIMELINE DATABASE).   There is also an engine that reads the database and constructs a filtergraph to accomplish that task, bridging the 2 previous components mentioned (The RENDER ENGINE).    In the future, we will probably see a component to read and write AAF files from the information in the timeline database.  We also have testing tools to create editing projects from  XML text files (you can type a description of your editing project in plain english!), and a simple VB app somewhat like Adobe Premiere you can use to make editing projects.  Pretty cool, eh? 2.  Using and Testing Dexter The easiest way to play with Dexter is through the XML parser test app, XMLTLTST.  You can build this app in the  dexter\test\xmltltst  directory (make sure you ve built in the  dexter  directory first). Usage: XMLTLTST /n input.xtl [output.grf] [output.xtl] If you just type: XMLTLTST filename.xtl the app will  execute the project described in the file, and render a preview to the screen.  (There is no support at this time for creating AVI or ASF files of the project from XML) XMLTLTST filename.xtl filename.grf will also create a .grf file of the project, that can later be played with MediaPlayer where you can seek around in it., or load it into Graphedt to alter the graph to save the project in an AVI file, etc..    The "/n" flag will skip playing a preview of the file, and only create a .grf file for you XMLTLTST filename.xtl output.xtl This will save a copy of filename.xtl back out as output.xtl, after sending it through our load and save code, testing our persistance of files.  It won't look identical, but it should be functionally identical. You can have as many .grf or .xtl output arguments as you want. One of the basic units of an editing project is a track.  A track consists of a number of clips, one after the other, that cannot overlap.  For instance, three clips or pieces of data coming from three different sources put back to back would make up a track.  For video or audio tracks, if there are gaps between the clips, that part of the track is transparent and you will hear or see the contents of the tracks underneath.  If there is no content on any track for a given period of time, black or silence will be used to fill it.  You are also allowed to have one or more 1-input video or audio effects on a portion of a clip or on a portion of a track.  (If you want the whole sequence in black and white, it's easier to put the B&W effect on the whole track instead of 3 times on each of the clips.)  The effects are allowed to overlap.  One important audio effect supported is a crossfade, where you can vary the output volume over time. For video or audio projects, you can combine tracks to make a composition.  Tracks are layered on top of each other, and you will only see the top layer.   If there is no content in one track, you will see the content of the layer beneath it.  A track may have one or more transitions on it, where that track's contents will be blended somehow with the total output of the layers beneath it.   These transitions may not overlap.  For audio projects, the only logical transition supported is a mixer, but video has countless possible transitions. A composition may be used as a track in another composition.  This allows for arbitrary complexity.  Compositions also may have effects and transitions associated with them (for example to make an entire project B&W, or fade an entire project in from silence). A timeline can produce any number of streams, based on how many top level composition nodes it has (for instance 1 video stream and 2 audio streams).  Each top level node is an editing project in itself, and a separate subgraph is built for each of them, with a switcher and other supporting filters. SYNTAX: <timeline> : the main project tag <composite> : identifies a project that is to be a track of another parent project <group type="video"> : identifies a top-level project of the timeline that represents one output stream of either "video" or "audio" <composition> : one or more tracks collected as a composition can be treated as a track in another composition <track> : a track  <clip src="filename.ext" tlstart="a" tlstop="b" mstart="c" mstop="d"> : a piece of media placed on the timeline from a to b, consisting of the piece of that file from c to d <effect clsid="{xxxxx}" start="a" stop="b"> : a one input Direct X Video Transform lasting from a to b <transition clsid="{xxxxx}" start=a" stop="b" direction="a2b"> : a two input Direct X Video Transform lasting from a to b and either transitioning from a to b, or from b to a. As with all XML, if a tag is fully specified, it ends with a "/" before the closing ">".   If other lines come in between, there is no "/" in the tag, but a closing tag beginning with a "/" is required. <tag1/> <tag2> <subtag2/> </tag2> RULES: clips within a track cannot overlap an effect can be on a clip, track, or composition.  There can be multiple effects which can all overlap a transition can be on a track or composition.  There can be multiple transitions, but they cannot overlap. A transition on the first track means black is the other source. Effects and Parameters can have arbitrary properties set on them (IDispatch will be called on the DirectX Transform with your property settings) .XTL SYNTAX:       the values shown in quotes are in most cases, the default value if that parameter is left out. // <timeline> //      output="foo.avi" (default is preview) (not yet implemented) //      duration = "time" (optional) // <group> //      Name="Project X" (Switch will get this name) //      FrameRate="15.0"         !!! anything with more than seven decimal  digits won't work!

Only decreasing the volume is recommended. //  This example sets the volume of an object to 1/2 volume //  <!-- this effect can be on a clip, track, composite or group--> //  <effect clsid="{036A9790-C153-11d2-9EF7-006008039E37}" start="0" stop="5"> //          <param name="vol" value=".5"/> //  </effect> //  This example fades the volume out //  <effect clsid="{036A9790-C153-11d2-9EF7-006008039E37}" start="0" stop="5"> //          <param name="vol" value="1.0"> //              <at time="5" value="0"/> //          </param> //  </effect> EXPLANATIONS: Some of the tags are straightforward, and will be obvious once you look at an example.  Here are some of the less common flags: <clip src="foo.ext"> A source clip can be any streaming media type that DShow supports, eg.  avi, asf, mpg, mov, wav, etc.  It can also be a still image for video... .bmp, .dib, .jpg and .jpeg are the supported still image formats.   All these objects have timeline times (tlstart and tlstop).  Everything but still images have media times too (mlstart and mlstop).    Sequences of still images are also supported.... EG: If you specify a filename of "pict098.jpg" and there exists files called "pict099.jpg" "pict100.jpg" etc., every frame, a new picture will be sent, instead of the same image every frame.   In order to get this feature, you must specify the frame rate of the sequence (at what rate playback of the sequence will look "normal") with the FrameRate parameter, otherwise, just that one individual picture will be used. Since all clips are stretched to the group's size, you have 3 choices about how to stretch a particular clip, using the StretchMode parameter.  If nothing is specified, "Stretch" is assumed.    "Stretch" means stretch the video to the new size; aspect ratio may not be preserved.  "Crop" means take a chunk out of the centre of the source clip that is the same as the group size, using black around it if it is too small.  No stretching is done.  Finally, "PreserveAspectRatio" will stretch the clip to the new group size, but preserve the aspect ratio, putting black around the edges that need extra padding. <transition SwapInputs="1"/> Optionally switches the inputs to the transition around.   EG: With SwapInputs="1" a wipe that normally has the new video wipe in from the left, will have the old video wipe in from the left overtop the new vide. This works well with the above example of running the progress backwards, so you can make a left to right wipe go right to left (by running the progress backwards) and have the old video on the left and the new video on the right (by swapping the inputs).  Doing one without the other typically looks wierd. <group type="video" FrameRate="15" Width="320" Height="240" BitDepth="16"/> These are the defaults.  This determines the format of the video coming out of the switch.  BitDepths supported so far are only 16 (that will mean 555), 24, and 32.  Anything else will probably crash. <group type="audio" SamplingRate="44100"/> (This is the default).  This determines the format of the audio coming out of the switch.  (only 8000, 11025, 22050, 32000, 44100, and 48000 are allowed right now, I think. anything else will crash) <clip> mstop and tlstop are optional, but one of the two must be specified.  If one is left out, it assumes a normal rate of speed for playback. <group Name="Project X"/> This will cause the switcher for that group to be named that name, so you can do a FindFileByName in the filter graph to get the switcher for that group (each group uses a big switcher).  Then getting the first output pin of that filter will give you the main output stream of that group.  This is for simplicity. <group PreviewMode="0"> Normally, if you are previewing your project, and your effects and transitions are slow, so the project cannot keep up in real time, frames will be dropped to keep synchronization good (making the video look choppy).  (When writing to a file, frames will never be dropped).  If you force PreviewMode=0, then you will never drop frames, even when previewing to the screen, so you may see the video play very slowly out of sync with the audio.   Only slow effects and transitions are skipped in preview mode, if you have a slow decompressor, or data is coming over a slow network connection, frames will not be able to be dropped. <clip clsid="{xxx-xxx....}"/> Instead of using the default file source filter based on the filename you give, this will instantiate a particular source filter.  If you still give a filename using src="foo.ext", it will pass that filename to the filter using IFileSourceFilter. <clip category="{xxx-xxx...}" instance="USB Camera #1"/> This will choose a source filter by looking in filter category {xxx-xxx...} (for instance, the VideoCapture Filters category... default is the regular DShow Filters category) and use the source filter with the given friendly name given by "instance".  If no "instance" is given, the first filter in the category is used. mute="1" Any object can be muted.  This will turn that element and all of its children off (ie. all of the clips and effects and transitions of a track will be turned off when the track is turned off).  CURRENT LIMITATIONS: only audio and video types are supported only video supports transitions... there is always a default audio transition to mix all overlapping audio Video effects and transitions must be DirectX Transforms Audio effects can be any direct show filter There is a special volume changing audio effect that is directly supported by Dexter Example 1: This is the simplest possible project that simply plays 10 seconds of an avi file (the 10 seconds from 30 to 40 seconds into the movie) with accompanying audio. The audio will be at half volume. (Two streams are generated, one for each group).  You can have more than one group with each type of media, for instance to author an ASF file with mutliple video streams, but typically you will want one group of each type. In this example, the video is 640x480 24bit RGB at 7.5 frames per second, and the audio is 48kHz.  Also note that mstop is left out from the video clip and tlstop is left out from the audio clip, since they can be computed using the other numbers and assuming normal rate playback. <timeline>     <group type="video" FrameRate="7.5" Width="640" Height="480" BitDepth="24">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" />         </track>     </group>     <group type="audio" SamplingRate="48000">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" mstart="30" mstop="40" > <param name="vol" value=".5"/>             </clip>         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 2: This plays the video and audio at half speed (20 seconds of source material have 40 seconds in which to play) <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="40" mstart="30" mstop="50" />         </track>     </group>     <group type="audio">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="40" mstart="30" mstop="50" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 3: This plays three 10 second clips of video back to back, with 1 second of black space between each clip.  Remember, a track can have multiple clips on it, as long as the clips don't overlap.  The first clip plays normally.  The second clip show a single still frame from that video for 10 seconds, and the third clip is a JPEG compressed bitmap displayed for 10 seconds. <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />             <clip src="c:\bar.avi" tlstart="11" tlstop="21" mstart="15" mstop="15" />            <clip src="c:\blah.jpg" tlstart="22" tlstop="32" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 4: This is the same as example 3, except that the first 5 seconds of clip#2 will be upside down.  If you changed Mute to 1, it would no longer be upside down, as that effect would not really be there. <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />             <clip src="c:\bar.avi" tlstart="11" tlstop="21" mstart="15" mstop="15" > <effect clsid="{B05A941C-3CE1-11D2-952A-00C04FA34F05}" start="11" stop="16" Mute="0"/>            </clip>            <clip src="c:\blah.jpg" tlstart="22" tlstop="32" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 5:  This is the same as #3, except that all three clips will be upside down, since the effect is on the whole track, and not just an individual clip <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />             <clip src="c:\bar.avi" tlstart="11" tlstop="21" mstart="15" mstop="15" />             <clip src="c:\blah.jpg" tlstart="22" tlstop="32" />             <effect clsid="{B05A941C-3CE1-11D2-952A-00C04FA34F05}" start="0" stop="32" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 6:  This project has two tracks.  Whenever tracks overlap, the track specified last has priority, so in this case, bar.mpg will be seen for the first 10 seconds, and after that, the last 2 seconds of foo.mpg.  <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.mpg" tlstart="0" tlstop="12" mstart="30" mstop="42" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="12" mstop="22" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 7:  In this example, you will see the 2 clips in track 2 play, and in the 1 second gap between them, you will see the clip from the first track peek through. <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="20" mstart="30" mstop="50" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="12" mstop="22" />             <clip src="c:\blah.mov" tlstart="11" tlstop="20" mstart="12" mstop="21" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 8:  Now there is a transition specified during the overlapping period of 2 tracks, so you will see the first clip fade to the second clip.   You will also hear the audio tracks mixed during the overlapping period. <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="7" tlstop="15" mstart="12" mstop="20" />             <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="7" stop="10" />         </track>     </group>     <group type="audio">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="7" tlstop="15" mstart="12" mstop="20" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 9:  Here you will see the first clip fade to the second clip, and then fade back to the first clip (by swapping the inputs of the last transition) <timeline>     <group type="video">         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="20" mstart="30" mstop="50" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="5" tlstop="15" mstart="12" mstop="22" />             <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="5" stop="8" />             <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="12" stop="15" SwapInputs="1" />          </track>     </group> </timeline> Example 10:  An example of compositions.  Here you will see example 9 fade into example 5, with each example treated as if it was a track.  You'll see example 9 from 0 to 15 seconds, then a fade for 5 seconds, and after 20 seconds, you'll see only example 5.   This is an example of a transition being on a composition. <timeline>     <group type="video">       <composition>         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="20" mstart="30" mstop="50" />         </track>         <track>             <clip src="c:\bar.mpg" tlstart="5" tlstop="15" mstart="12" mstop="22" />             <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="5" stop="8" />             <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="12" stop="15" SwapInputs="1" />          </track>       </composition>       <composition>         <track>             <clip src="c:\foo.avi" tlstart="0" tlstop="10" mstart="30" mstop="40" />             <clip src="c:\bar.avi" tlstart="11" tlstop="21" mstart="15" mstop="15" />             <clip src="c:\blah.avi" tlstart="22" tlstop="32" mstart="12" mstop="32" />             <effect clsid="{B05A941C-3CE1-11D2-952A-00C04FA34F05}" start="0" stop="32" />         </track>         <transition clsid="{2A54C913-07AA-11D2-8D6D-00C04F8EF8E0}" start="15" stop="20" />       </composition>     </group> </timeline> Example 11:  Here, you will see a dib sequence play.  The dib sequence is stated as being a 15fps sequence, so 15 pictures played within a one second duration would look normal.    In this case, the final project is an 8 frame per second project, so basically, every other jpg file in the sequence will be played at 8 fps as a result of this project (which will only last one second).  Also, the pictures will not be stretched normally to the group size,  an aspect ratio preserving stretch will be made. <timeline>     <group type="video"    Width="640" Height="480" FrameRate="8" >         <track>             <clip src="c:\ski001.jpg" tlstart="0" tlstop="1" FrameRate="15" StretchMode="PreserveAspectRatio" />         </track>     </group> </timeline> Congratulations.  Now you understand XML. The chapters after this one might contain WAY more detail than you care to read.  They were mostly written in case I die, so someone will be able to figure out how it all works.   If you want more intimite detail about how Dexter works, you can read on. 3.  The Filter Collection Video, audio and other data can come from any source.  Any DShow stream can be used as input.   MPEG, QuickTime,  and AVI files of different sizes, frame rates and compression types can be mixed at will.  There are no limitations.  Every stream is converted to be the same format before the pieces are editing together and mixed.  For video, everything is the same bit depth, frame rate, and frame size.  For audio, it is the same sampling rate, channels, and bit count.  All of the inputs go into a big switcher, whose outputs are connected to various special effect, or mixer filters (for video and audio), which are re-routed back into the mixer.   The last output of the mixer is connected to some rendering filters, to preview or write the result to a file.  So the special filters that are used to make an editing graph are:  1) GENERATE BLACK VIDEO - for when you want black in your presentation 2) GENERATE STILL VIDEO - for putting still images in your presentation 3) SILENCE - for when there is no audio in a portion of your presentation 4) STRETCH VIDEO - to resize video 5) FRAME RATE CONVERTER - to correct the frame rate of a video 6) AUDIO REPACKER - to break the audio stream into equal size packets 7) BIG SWITCH - the brains 8) DIRECTX TRANSFORM WRAPPER - hosts one or more DirectX Transforms for video effects 9) AUDIO MIXER - mixes several audio streams For example, in a video editing project, each source file being used would be a graph looking like this, whose output would go into one of the inputs of the big switch.  The first three filters, you are familiar with. The STRETCH VIDEO filter is programmed with the interface IResize (which sets the media type to accept, for instance, RGB32, and the size to resize to, for instance, 320x240).  There is also a property page you can use from graphedit instead of programming the filter, which can set the output size.  If you use the property page and do not program the filter, it will only accept RGB32. The FRAME RATE CONVERTER filter is programmed with the interface IFrmRateConverter.  This sets the output frame rate to generate, as well as the media start/stop times and the skew.  What are those?  Let's say for the first 10 seconds of your presention, you want to see the portion of this file from 30 to 40 seconds.  The media start and stop times will be 30 and 40 seconds, since that is the piece of this video you are interested in.  The skew is the offset to add to the media start time to get the project time.  In this case, this piece of video starts at the beginning of the project, or time 0, so the skew is -30.   You should always have a frame rate converter in this stream, even if the original source video is already the correct frame rate.  There may be errors or mistakes in the stream, and the frame rate converter will correct them. embed Paint.Picture  An audio source stream would look like this:  There may be one or more ACM converters to decompress the audio stream and convert it to a given format.  The AUDIO REPACKER will break all the audio streams up into equal size packets, say 1/30 of a second.  This is programmable through the IAudRepack interface.  Like the frame rate converter for video streams, every audio stream must have an audio repacker to pack the audio streams all the same way. embed Paint.Picture  If you are using black video as a source, or silence, the stream would consist only of that one filter.  It will produce the data at the correct format without needing any other filters.  BLACK supports the IGenVideo interface on its output pin, and SILENCE supports the ISilence interface on its output pin.  You can set the output format, frame/sample rate, and start time and duration with this interface.  This way you do not need a frame rate or sample rate converter.  For instance, if you need black video from 20 to 30 seconds in your presentation, you would set a start time of 20 and a duration of 10 seconds. If you are using a still image as a source, that image will be repeated over and over at a certain frame rate.    BMP, JPG and GIFs are supported at the moment.  You may still need a STRETCH VIDEO filter to resize it.  STILL VIDEO supports IGenVideo on its output pin, and you can set the frame rate, start time and duration.  You can also give it your own raw bits to produce, instead of a file name. You can also get video or audio from any other source in DShow.  Just remember to convert it to the proper uncompressed format, and frame rate convert the video or repack the audio. The BIG SWITCH The big switch supports the interface IBigSwitch. With this interface, you set the media type for the connections, the frame rate it will receive (the same frame rate all the frame rate converters are set to), the project duration, the number of inputs and outputs, and most importantly you program the switch matrix. Let's start with a simple example.  We want to play 10 seconds of video from stream 1, and then cut to 10 seconds of video from stream 2.  Here is a picture: embed Paint.Picture  The project length is 20 seconds. Input pin 0 would be programmed like this:   At time 0, connect to output 0.  At time 10, connect nowhere. Input pin 1 would be programmed like this:   At time 10, connect to output 0.  At time 20, connect nowhere. The DIRECTX TRANSFORM WRAPPER The DirectX Transform wrapper filter supports the IAMMixEffect interface.  You can program it to know what media type to accept, how many inputs (1 or 2) and queue up a bunch of effects.  Each effect has a lifetime... for instance the wrapper might act as a wipe from 0 to 10 seconds, and as a dissolve from 10 to 20 seconds.  Within the lifetime, each effect has an active period.  For instance, the wipe may be active from 4 to 6 seconds, and the dissolve may be active from 11 to 14 seconds.   For a one input effect, before the active time, no processing will be done.  During the active period, either a fixed amount of processing will be done, or a variable amount, changing throughout the active period (arbitrarily and user-settable).  After the active period, no processing will be done.   For a two input effect, before the active time, the first input will be presented.  During the active time, the transition between the first and second inputs will either be a fixed amount, or arbitrarily variable.  After the active time, the second input will be presented. The Big Switch and the DirectX Transform Wrapper do not have property pages, and cannot be played with in graphedit since there is no way to call the interfaces to program them.  You will need to compile them specially to create a switch or fx wrapper to suit your purpose.  (The switch is located in filterus\dexter\switch.  The DXT wrapper is found in filterus\dexter\dxt\dxtwrap).  You will find code in these filters inside #IFDEF TEST that you can change to suit your needs, and then you will be able to make editing graphs using graphedit.  When you save an editing graph, it will remember all of the settings of every filter when it is re-loaded. Here is a more complicated example of a video editing project, using transitions and effects. Our project will be 10 seconds long.  Clip A lasts from 0 to 6 seconds.  Clip B lasts from 4 to 10 seconds.  Clip A is the 6 second portion of "foo.avi" from 20 to 26 seconds.  Clip B is the 6 second portion of "bar.avi" from 13 to 19 seconds.  Where Clip A and B overlap, there will be a wipe effect, with B coming in from the left.   This entire project will be fading in from black, with black only at 0 seconds, and finally the full video showing at 10 seconds.  Also, the middle 4 seconds of Clip A (from 1 to 5 seconds) will have a black and white effect on it (only the first and last second will be in the original colour).  Thus Clip A will switch from B&W to colour in the middle of the wipe. This is the graph that will do this task. embed Paint.Picture  NOTE:  The real switcher has output#0 as the main stream output, in this example it is the last output pin that is the main stream output.  In real life, though, it is always pin #0. There are probably many ways to program this graph.  I will demonstrate 2 of them METHOD 1 - All relevant filters are programmed to accept RGB32, and to output 15fps (or whatever you'd like) - BLACK source is set to output 10 seconds of black, starting at time 0 - CLIP A's frame rate converter has MediaStart=20, MediaStop=26, Skew=-20 - CLIP B's frame rate converter has MediaStart=13, MediaStop=19, Skew = -3 - DXT Wrapper 1 has lifetime 1 to 5, active time 1 to 5, the B&W effect is chosen (set to always be full B&W during the active period) - DXT Wrapper 2 has lifetime 4 to 6, active time 4 to 6, the WIPE transition is chosen (set to vary linearly between A and B) - DXT Wrapper 3 has lifetime 0 to 10, active time 0 to 10, the DISSOLVE transition is chosen (set to vary linearly between A and B) - Switch input 0 is programmed as follows:  at time 0 output to 3.  at time 10 no output - Switch input 1:  at time 0 output to 4.  at time 1 output to 0, at time 5 output to 1, at time 6 no output - Switch input 2:  at time 4 output to 2, at time 6 output to 4, at time 10 no output - Switch input 3:  at time 1 output to 4, at time 4 output to 1, at time 5 no output - Switch input 4:  at time 4 output to 4, at time 6 no output - Switch input 5:  at time 0, output to 5, at time 10 no output METHOD 2 - All relevant filters are programmed to accept RGB32, and to output 15fps (or whatever you'd like) - BLACK source is set to output 10 seconds of black, starting at time 0 - CLIP A's frame rate converter has MediaStart=20, MediaStop=26, Skew=-20 - CLIP B's frame rate converter has MediaStart=13, MediaStop=19, Skew = -3 - DXT Wrapper 1 has lifetime 0 to 6, active time 1 to 5, the B&W effect is chosen (set to always be full B&W during the active period) - DXT Wrapper 2 has lifetime 0 to 10, active time 4 to 6, the WIPE transition is chosen (set to vary linearly between A and B) - DXT Wrapper 3 has lifetime 0 to 10, active time 0 to 10, the DISSOLVE transition is chosen (set to vary linearly between A and B) - Switch input 0 is programmed as follows:  at time 0 output to 3.  at time 10 no output - Switch input 1:  at time 0 output to 0.  at time 6 no output - Switch input 2:  at time 4 output to 2, at time 10 no output - Switch input 3:  at time 0 output to 1, at time 6 no output - Switch input 4:  at time 0 output to 4, at time 10 no output - Switch input 5:  at time 0, output to 5, at time 10 no output Study these examples carefully. (!!!!!!) Audio examples using the mixer and repacker will be given when it works. COMPILING DEXTER If you are able to build any part of DirectShow, you can build Dexter.  You will need the NT build environment set up, and to be enlisted in the DShow tree. 1.  "iebuild" in the private\dxmdev\dshowdev directory of the NT build environment 2.  "iebuild" in the makesdk directory of the quartz tree 3.  "iebuild" in the sdl\classes\base directory of the quartz tree 4.  "iebuild" in the filterus\dexter directory of the quartz tree.  This contains all of the dexter code 5.  "iebuild" in the compdlls\qedit directory of the quartz tree.  This will create qedit.dll in libd\i386 (a debug version) 6.  "regsvr32" qedit.dll on a machine to install it.  You will need msvcrtd.dll (the debug c runtime) in order to use the debug dexter. If you wish to write programs using the dexter filters and interfaces, you will need to include the qedit_i.c file (created when you compiled filterus\dexter\idl) in your program, and link with ?????  (!!! how does this work???) 4. The Timeline Database The following interfaces are available for an application to describe an editing project:  IAMTimeline, IAMTimelineObj, IAMTimelineTrack, IAMTimelineSrc, IAMTimelineEffect, IAMTimelineTrans, IAMTimelineComp, IAMTimelineEffectable, IAMTimelineTransable,  IAMTimelineNode, IAMTimelineXFade, and finally IAMTimelineHelper which is even higher level to help you do common tasks. (!!!)  Eric can put more detail here about using these APIs.  For now, read the interface descriptions in the idl file (start with the high level IAMTimelineHelper) and look at the XML reader code that uses these APIs to see how it's done.  \filterus\dexter\test\xmltl. 5.  The Render Engine The render engine reads the timeline database and builds a filtergraph to execute the project.  It supports IRenderEngine, and you basically tell it what timeline you are using, and it can build a graph for you.  You can set the output frame rate and size for video streams, or output format for audio streams.  It also tells you all of the outputs of the graph (for instance maybe your project produces 1 video stream and 2 audio streams, by having 3 top level compositions in the timeline).   You will be able to render these outputs, perhaps much like the capture graph builder, and send the output to be previewed, or to be written to a file, or transmitted somewhere, using any DShow rendering filters available. (!!!) Eric can put more detail here, there are other things it can do.  See the idl file for more details.  Not everything is implemented yet. 6.  Testing tools After reading this document, you can learn the details of the interfaces by reading our idl file, in filterus\dexter\idl\qedit.idl. There is a tool to take a text file with extended XML and execute that project by building a timeline, and calling the render engine.  It is found in filterus\dexter\test\xmltl.  This is described in chapter 2.   We also have a VB app (!!! NOT CHECKED IN YET!)  which has a crude user interface you can use to build editing projects.  This will be improved as time goes by. Testing this project will involve the following: 1)  Using the XML text file tool to create projects 2) Using the VB app 3) Making projects in Graphedit, which will involve custom compiles of the switcher and DXT wrapper at this point. 4.  Writing applications to test the timeline and render engine APIs to do specific editing projects. (Be creative!  There are unlimited possibilities.) 5.  Writing applications to build filtergraphs directly to perform editing tasks without using the timeline or render engine APIs (such as the examples in section 2).  This is less important than #4. Please see DannyMi with any questions.   This is a fun and exciting project, and I hope everyone that becomes involved will really enjoy their time spent with it. jKy|: jGy|:

//  Effects and transitions can have a <param> sub tag, to specify parameters
//  you can set on that DirectXTransform.  Most transitions support "progress",
//  to specify how much of A vs. B you want to see.  Most other possible
//  parameters are transform specific.
//
//
//  Our SMPTE wipe DXT that is part of Dexter supports the following parameters:
//  (more information needs to be written about this)
//
//  "MaskName" - if not NULL, use this JPEG as the wipe instead of a standard
//               SMPTE wipe
//  "MaskNum" - which SMPTE wipe # to use (see TedWi for chart of wipes)
//  "ScaleX" - stretch the shape of the wipe
//   "ScaleY" - stretch the shape of the wipe
//  "OffsetX" - have the transform start off centre
//  "OffsetY" - have the transform start off centre
//  "ReplicateX" - duplicate the shape this many times horizontally
//  "ReplicateY" - duplicate the shape this many times vertically
//  "BorderColor" - colour of border between A and B
//  "BorderWidth" - width of border between A and B
//  "BorderSoftness" - additional width to be blurry
//
//  The value of the parameter can change over time, jumping to a new value at
//  a new time, or interpolating from the last point to a new value at a new
//  point.  Here's a wacky example of a wipe effect that flies around wildly
//  instead of going linearly from left to right as it would have done by
//  default:
//  NOTE: All parameter times are relative to the start of the effect
//  or transition, and are zero based!
//
//<transition clsid="{AF279B30-86EB-11D1-81BF-0000F87557DB}" start="2" stop="9">
//                <param name="progress" value="0.0">
//                       <at time="1" value="0.5"/>
//                        <at time="2" value="1.0"/>
//                        <linear time="5" value="0.0"/>
//                        <linear time="6" value="1.0"/>
//                        <linear time="6.5" value="0.0"/>
//                        <linear time="7.0" value="1.0"/>
//                </param>
//</transition>
//
//  This example runs the progress backwards... eg.  a left to right wipe
//  becomes a right to left wipe, starting with all new video and wiping back
//  to old video:
//
//<transition clsid="{AF279B30-86EB-11D1-81BF-0000F87557DB}" start="2" stop="8">
//                <param name="progress" value="1.0">
//                       <linear time="6" value="0"/>
//                </param>
//</transition>
//
//  The first value on the same line as the parameter name is the value at time
//  0, and will always be the value unless other values are specified as
//  sub tags underneath it.  "Progress" is a parameter that you will likely
//  want to vary over time.  The SMPTE DXT parameters are not...
//  you would simply say:
//
//<transition clsid="{dE75D012-7A65-11D2-8CEA-00A0C9441E20}" start="2" stop="4">
//            <param name="MaskNum" value="107"/>
//             <param name="BorderWidth" value="3"/>
//</transition>
//
//  The above example uses the clsid of the SMPTE DXT.  By default is does a
//  left to right wipe with no border.
//
//  Here's a fun example:  A 2x3 matrix of tall skinny hearts with the border
//  colour changing dynamically!!!
//
//<transition clsid="{dE75D012-7A65-11D2-8CEA-00A0C9441E20}" start="2" stop="4">

DirectShow Sample -- Metronome Filter
-------------------------------------

This sample filter shows how to implement a reference clock.  The filter uses 
your default microphone input to listen for audio spikes (clicks, hand claps, 
coughs, etc.), which it will use to determine a clock rate.

After building the filter, run the included .REG file to register the DLL
(metronom.ax).  Copy the metronom.ax file to your windows system directory
(ie. \winnt\system32\metronom.ax).

To use the filter:
     - Build a filter graph with a video component (or audio and video)
     - Delete the "Default DSound Renderer" from the graph (which removes
         the reference clock from the graph)
     - Select Graph->Insert Filters in GraphEdit
     - Expand the DirectShow Filters node and insert the "Metronome" filter
     - Play the graph
     - The video will begin playing at normal speed.  To modify the speed,
         clap your hands or use a metronome to set a new speed.  For best
         results, start clapping at the same rate that you were clapping
         when you set the clock rate, then speed up or slow down the rate.


Release Notes
=============

1.  This filter works for VIDEO ONLY.  Our audio renderer is not capable 
of slaving  to radically different clock rates.   Make a graph in graphedit 
of some video file, and then Insert the "metronome" filter into the graph.  
If the clip contains an audio component, then remove the "Default DSound 
Renderer" from the filter graph.  Play the graph.

2.  Clap into your microphone.  If you clap 92 times per minute (once every 
~652 ms) the movie will play at the normal rate.  You can change this default 
near the top of the .cpp file.  Clap faster or slower, and the playback rate 
of the video will change accordingly.  

3.  Or, hook up an electronic metronome by a cable to your sound card, and 
turn the dial and watch the video playback speed change.

4.  If you don't clap for any length of time, it keeps on at the old rate, 
so you can give your hands a rest.  But when you start clapping again, you must 
start clapping at about the same speed you left off at, and then slow down 
or speed up, or it will ignore you.  To be precise:  Don't suddenly start 
clapping more than TWICE as slow as you were before you stopped, or you'll 
be ignored.

5.  DShow can't play infinitely fast.  The limit depends on your CPU speed.  
If you try and go much faster than is possible for any length of time, it will 
get confused, will stop working, and you won't be able to slow it down.  
Press STOP and PLAY again.


The only important rule for writing a clock is this:  
    Your clock can NEVER GO BACKWARDS!

When you are asked what time it is, never give a time before the last reported time.

Remaining work items:

* IMediaSeeking

* Bypass performance, segment objects and do our own MIDI parsing, note messages straight to the port.

* Performance

  - Responsiveness to Active() too slow! The DirectMusic objects need to be created on the same thread as they are accessed, otherwise DirectMusic-related start dying.

  - Running the graph, stopping the graph, then rerunning the graph DM ports are messed up

* Extras
  - Property sheets displaying DirectMusic-performance information, latency times
  - Why does ASYNC->DMUSIC->WAVDEST (sdk sample)->File Writer not work?

Things that aren't handled yet:
Downloading samples
Selecting GM samples
Better algorithm for stealing voices -- need to at least support
	channel priority per DLS spec.
fractional loop points in sample? (not in Level 1, but easy?)
registered parameter numbers -- esp. pitch bend range
	(look at controllers 96, 97, 100, 101, 6, 38?)

controllers 91 & 93: seem to be used often, should we implement?

assert in Quartz filter when playing Almonds.MID--bad MIDI framing?
	-- havent' seen this lately....

support SYSEX for "hindered MIDI"--ignore channels 13-16 -- done
	in Quartz MIDI source filter, possibly by exposing different
	media subtype for hindered midi files

Ring 0 synth implementation--waiting for George...

Fix attack segment using concave transform

Support for unloading collections, delayed loading of waves from wave pool
instrument locking....


Things done from list:
special-case for drum instrument
	- Done: Seperate place for drum instruments.
All Notes Off correct support
drum instrument off by one
simple version of velocity to volume scaling
16 bit samples & compression to 8 bits.
	- done, but compression algorithm needs work
fix pitch clamping to 24 semitones.
	- Done: Increase range to 48 and drop octave if exceeded.
Ensure compressed samples don't have delta > 128 when loading
	- done, done while compressing
Default pan
	- done, no check that it's only a drum, should there be?
CSourceEG::m_dwVelAttackScale, CSourceEG::m_dwKeyDecayScale
	- done, easy once I realized time cents are a lot like pitch cents....

DVD-ROM Boilerplate video
-------------------------

The DVD-ROM boilerplate video is provided for developers producing DVD-ROM titles that contain no DVD-Video formatted data. A disc without a proper DVD-Video zone may behave unpredictably when placed in a standalone DVD-Video player, possibly ejecting the disc or locking up. This confusing situation can be avoided by adding the DVD-ROM boilerplate video to the disc. When the disc is inserted into a DVD-Video player it will display a message informing the user that the disc is designed to work in a DVD-ROM PC with Microsoft Windows. An autorun.inf file should be included on the disc so that Windows will launch the specified executable rather than automatically launching the DVD Player and displaying the boilerplate video message.

When creating the DVD-ROM image, copy the VIDEO_TS directory and its contents, and the AUDIO_TS directory (which is empty), to the root directory of the DVD-ROM image. (Don't copy this readme file.) Be sure to use image formatting software that properly recognizes the DVD-Video zone and places it at the physical beginning of the disc.

The DVD-ROM boilerplate video files may be used on any DVD-ROM title in accordance with the Distribution Requirements of the SDK End-User License Agreement.

This directory is TEMPORARY!  Don't panic -- It will be removed when Quartz.Dll
is finally built with VC5.  For now, Ralph Lipe (email: RalphL) is responsible
for building the binaries daily and checking them in here.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. A/V GLITCH INSTRUMENTATION TitleA/V GLITCH INSTRUMENTATION Arthur Zwiegincew Normal.dot Arthur Zwiegincew Microsoft Word 9.0H{6xA"bjbjU A/V GLITCH INSTRUMENTATION The following components are instrumented: Quartz.dll (VMR) Dsound.dll Kmixer.sys Usbaudio.sys Portcls.sys Instrumentation is done via WMI Event Tracing. It has both user-mode and kernel-mode interfaces. For user-mode, refer to multimedia\published\dxmdev\dshowdev\base\*perf*. Perflog.cpp exports a simple interface that VMR and Dsound use. For kernel-mode, refer to perf.c (or perf.cpp) in kmixer, usbaudio, and portcls sources. Grep for calls implemented in perf.c[pp] in the rest of the sources to see how instrumentation is implemented. For WMI Event Tracing information, contact Jee Fung Pang. There are two instrumentation clients (at the time of writing): DSTrace (multimedia\dshow\tools\dstrace). It s a simple console app that outputs glitch information (you can ignore the  type n  portion of the output dstrace parses that and prints the component name at the beginning of each line). Each line is terminated by a time reference, which is the result of GetTickCount(). It s useful as a template for writing other clients. It s not possible to see how long each glitch was, but some compenents (especially dsound) will tend to report longer glitches as more than one glitch. That s why it s important to look at timestamps on glitch events. DSPerf (multimedia\dshow\tools\dsperf). It exports glitch information as perf counters. It can also be used as a demo for getting the video frame rate and jitter (dstrace doesn t output that). To use the perf counters: Build dsperf.dll. Copy it to system32. From the source directory, install the .reg file, and execute lodctr dsperf.ini. Counters should be available under the DShow object. If counters aren t displayed in perfmon, try coping dsperf.dll to %windir%. Recent Whistler builds have been somewhat flaky, and this helped. If counters are displayed, but aren t working, make sure that dstrace works (the easiest way to check is to play video; dstrace will output a   for every frame rendered). It probably won t work, which means you re probably using a video renderer other than VMR. To fully instrument USB audio, you ll need an Intel hardware board that acts as a USB audio device, but also exports perf data to another computer via a serial cable. UsbGlitch (multimedia\dshow\tools\usbglitch) will export this serial information through WMI Event Tracing. If you have questions, contact ArthurZ.

Common Objects: Point, Size, Offset, Rect  GOTOBUTTON _Toc286720436    PAGEREF _Toc286720436  Introduction Purpose Of This Document BoxNet is a collection of COM/MDA objects that implements a  network of boxes , as described in Section   REF _Ref285437618 \n  .  BoxNet might be used as part of an implementation of filter sheets, but initially BoxNet s primary purpose is as an example of a simple IGOR container object. This document describes the functional design of BoxNet, i.e. all high-level aspects of BoxNet that users of BoxNet would need to know.  Included is information about user interface, OLE Automation access to BoxNet, and C/C++ access to BoxNet.  This information would also be useful to people wanting to create a functional specification, user education materials, testing plans, etc. for BoxNet. Note that this document does not describe how BoxNet is implemented. See also: \\sierra\high\cat\current\catedit.doc and ...\terms.doc. Abstract Concept Conceptually, a BoxNet represents a  network of boxes , i.e. a collection of rectangles with directional links between pairs of rectangles, as illustrated in   REF _Ref284568173 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 1  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  .  BoxNet graph view Each large rectangle is a box; the text in the center is the box label.  Each small rectangle around the edge of a box is a socket; the text beside it is the socket label.  (The small rectangle itself is often called a socket tab.)  Socket labels and tabs belong to a box.  The arrows between two sockets are links.  Each link has a head (where the arrowhead is) and a tail.  A link may have one or more bends (e.g. the link between Blorg:S and Foo:A has 3 bends).  A socket may have at most one link connected to it.  REF _Ref284568173 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 1  shows a graph view of a box network.  See   REF _Ref284588419 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 10  for an alternate view, list view. Object Map A network of boxes is represented by a BoxNet, which is any object (such as an object of class SimpleBoxNet see below) that implements IBoxNet.  A BoxNet maintains a collection of BoxLink objects, each of which represents a link between two box sockets.  A BoxNet also maintains a collection of boxes; each box is represented by a Box object, which is any object (such as an object of class SimpleBox) that implements IBox.  A Box contains a collection of BoxSocket objects, each of which represents a box socket.  A BoxSocket contains a BoxSocketPos pseudo-object, which indicates the position of the socket tab on the box.  REF _Ref285280696 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 2  depicts an  object map , which shows how to get from one object to another (or, more precisely, how to obtain a pointer to a second object given a pointer to the first).  For example, accessing the  Boxes  property of a BoxNet or SimpleBoxNet object will give you a pointer to a Boxes collection object (see also section   REF _Ref285283217 \n  The bold arrows in   REF _Ref285280696 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 2  show containment relationships.  For example, a BoxSockets object contains zero or more BoxSocket objects, but a BoxLink doesn t contain a BoxSocket (the BoxLink merely points to related BoxSocket objects). Dashed arrows show pseudo-object relationships.  For example, a BoxSocket doesn t actually contain a BoxSocketPos object (for efficiency reasons), but, when requested, BoxSocket can create a temporary BoxSocketPos object that refers to the position of the socket.  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  .  BoxNet object map BoxNet Architecture BoxNet is an MDA container type.  To be more precise, BoxNet is the name for the relationship, loosely referred to as the  BoxNet architecture , among objects that implement the interfaces IBoxNet, IBox, IBoxLink, and IBoxSocket.  ( A BoxNet  is also used to refer to an object that implements IBoxNet.)  Implementations for some of these interfaces are supplied, as described in the following table: Interface Supplied Implementation Comments About Supplied Implementation IBoxNet SimpleBoxNet implements UI but no semantics; usually subclassed by a   implementation SimpleBox implements UI but no semantics; usually subclassed by a   implementation IBoxLink BoxLink usually sufficient for real applications IBoxSocket BoxSocket usually sufficient for real applications IBoxSocketPos BoxSocketPos usually sufficient for real applications SimpleBoxNet and SimpleBox are not very useful on their own, except perhaps as a  flow chart editor , since these objects don  anything: SimpleBoxNet lets you edit box networks (but applies no meaning to boxes and links), and SimpleBox displays and edits box labels and socket labels.  It s expected that SimpleBoxNet and SimpleBox would normally be aggregated into larger objects which would define other interfaces and specific semantics.  For example, an audio filter sheet could be implemented this way: a FilterSheetBoxNet object would connect audio streams among filter boxes such as an EchoFilterBox and a ReverbFilterBox. The methods shown are IDispatch-callable, and they have been chosen to be particularly useful when used with VBA.  For example, the VBA code shown in   REF _Ref285282063 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 3  will print the labels of all boxes and sockets.  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  .  Example of VBA code to traverse a BoxNet (VBA uses _NewEnum() in its implementation of  For Each .  _NewEnum() creates an enumerator object given a collection object.  An enumerator object maintains a pointer to the  current item  during an enumeration.) BoxNet-IGOR Communication BoxNet communicates with IGOR via the standard IGOR messages, as shown in   REF _Ref285102844 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 4  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  .  BoxNet-IGOR communication This is a high-level picture only see the individual object and interface descriptions for more information.  Note that, while it s assumed that the BoxNet data object will likely be subclassed to create a more useful implementation (e.g. an audio filter sheet), it s assumed that the two supplied view objects, BoxNetGraphView and BoxNetListView, can probably be used as-is, even with custom BoxNet implementations. Although IGOR only directly communcates with the BoxNet data and view objects, the IGOR-supplied interface implementations (IStorage, IEditDataSite, IEditViewSite, and ICommandList) are passed down to contained objects (boxes, links, etc.) so that they may access IGOR functionality such as displaying status bar text and issuing undo/redo-able commands. BoxNet-Box Communication IBox and IBoxSite are how boxes and a BoxNet data object communicate with each other, as shown in   REF _Ref285101429 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 5 .  Note that the BoxNet views take care of drawing boxes, so there are no  box view  objects.  A BoxNet also exposes an IStorage (passed to the box via IPersistStorage), IEditViewSite (so that the box can access IGOR services), and ICommandList (so that the box can queue commands in IGOR s global undo/redo stacks).  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  .  BoxNet-box communication BoxNet Abstract Class State Information (BoxNet) Any BoxNet data object (e.g. a SimpleBoxNet data object, as describe in Section   REF _Ref285283337 \n  ), maintains the following state information: a collection of box objects; a collection of boxes which are selected. Note that the current selection (of boxes) is a maintained by the data object, not by view objects. Implemented Interfaces (BoxNet) Any BoxNet data object needs to implement the following interfaces: Interface Implementation Information IBoxNet (Standard implementation.) IDataObject At a minimum, provide a native data representation. IDispatch At a minimum, support methods and properties from IBoxNet. IEditDataObject (Standard implementation.) IPersistStorage (Standard implementation.) IBoxNet Interface By definition, a BoxNet data object implements IBoxNet.  IBoxNet contains the following methods and properties, which are accessible via IDispatch: General Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description (One method for each command listed in Section   REF _Ref285106279 \n  CreateGraphView() As BoxNetGraphView Create a BoxNetGraphView object that s a view onto this BoxNet data object. CreateListView() As BoxNetListView Create a BoxNetListView object that s a view onto this BoxNet data object. Boxes Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description SelectBox(Box b) All other boxes (if any) are deselected, selected link (if any) is deselected, box b is selected. Mouse UI, graph view:  Left-down on box executes select-box(b) and begin move-box-selection-pending(b). Mouse/keyboard UI, list view:  List is a standard multi-select Windows list box; selecting box items selects the corresponding boxes.  Socket items cannot be selected. ToggleBoxSelection(Box b) If box b is selected, deselect it.  If not, select it. Mouse UI, graph view:  If box is initially selected: Sheft-left-down, then quickly release mouse button (else move-box-selection mode is entered and box remains selected).  If box is initially deselected: Shift-left down; box will be selected regardless of whether or not move-box-selection mode is entered. Mouse UI, list view:  See select-box mode. Links Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description ReplaceLink(BoxLink l, BoxLink lNew) Replace link l with lNew.  Free l. Commands (BoxNet) Boxes Command Description insert-box(b) Add box b to the BoxNet (in the position specified inside b). UI:  See insert-box mode. move-box-selection(off) Move the box selection (including each link connected to a selected box) to a new location, offset off pixels from its original location. UI:  See move-box-selection mode. tab-to-next-box If one box is selected, select another box, such that repeatedly hitting executing this command will cycle through all boxes.  If more than one box is selected, do nothing. Links Command Description delete-box-selection Delete the box selection. delete-link(l) Delete link l. UI:  See delete-selected-link command. insert-link(l) Add link l (which already contains pointers to the two boxes it is to link together) to the BoxNet. Mouse UI (graph mode only):  Left-down on link (not on a bend) while in allow-edit-bends mode. Bends Command Description delete-bend(b) Delete link bend (b). Mouse UI (graph mode only):  Left-down on or near b while in allow-edit-bends mode. move-bend(b, pt) Move link bend b (may be head or tail) to point pt. UI:  See move-bend mode. View Advise Messages (BoxNet) The following messages are sent to BoxNet views (via IEditViewObject::OnUpdate, usually initiated by IEditDataSite::UpdateAllViews) to indicate that the view must be redrawn, or view state may need to be changed in some way. Message Description cancel-modes cancel any current modes; for example, before a link is deleted, this message (and/or cancel-view-select?) would be broadcast to all views so that, in case a view was holding a pointer to the soon-to-be-deleted link object, the pointer would be released, which would avoid later GP Faults etc. caused by indirecting a bad pointer cancel-view-select cancel any view-specific selection draw-all redraw entire view draw-box draw only specified box draw-box-and-links draw only specified box and connecte links draw-box-socket-tab draw only specified socket tab draw-link draw only specified link SimpleBoxNet Data Object SimpleBoxNet is a BoxNet data object implementation, meaning it implements IBoxNet.  SimpleBoxNet applies no  semantic meaning  to a BoxNet it simply acts as a container for boxes.  (Therefore, as described in Section   REF _Ref285283217 \n  s expected that SimpleBoxNet would probably be subclassed in  real life  use.)

In particular, cut-selection, copy-selection, drag/drop (from BoxNet), etc. are implemented by creating an invisible BoxNet data object that represents a snapshot of the data being copied, as shown in   REF _Ref285176144 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 6 .  This snapshot object creates a standard OLE advise holder (via the OLE API CreateOLEAdviseHolder) to handle IDataObject::DAdvise requests, and a standard IGOR FORMATETC enumerator object to handle IDataObject::EnumFormatEtc requests.

BoxNetGraphView Object A BoxNetGraphView object is a view object which represents a  graph view  (in the sense of  graph  meaning  linked collection of nodes ) of a BoxNet data object (such as a SimpleBoxNet object). Graph View Visual Appearance A BoxNet graph view object displays a BoxNet in a manner visually similar to   REF _Ref284568173 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 1 State Information (BoxNetGraphView) A BoxNetGraphView object maintains the following state information: Which link, if any, is selected. Only one link can be selected at a time, and no link can be selected when a box is selected (or vice versa).  Note that link selection is view object state, while box selection is data object state.

MoveGhostLink(LinkBend b, Point pt) move bend b of the ghost link to be at position pt SelectLink(l) All boxes are deselected, selected link (if any) is deselected, link l is selected. Mouse UI (graph view only):  Left-down on l. Persistent Modes (BoxNetGraphView) These modes persist even while the mouse is not being dragged: Description allow-edit-bends Link bends can be added/deleted.  (Outside this mode, dragging on link bends moves them instead.) Mouse UI:  Left-double-click on any link. allow-move-socket In this mode, left-down in a socket begins move-socket mode.  Otherwise, left-down in an unoccupied socked begins insert-link mode, and left-down in an occupied socket begins move-link mode. insert-box(box-class) A ghost box b of class box-class is created and displayed (via ghost-box mode), and dragged until the user either left-clicks (causing the location of b to change to the location of the ghost, and an insert-box command to get executed) or hits Esc (causing b to be destroyed).  Transient Mouse-Initiated Modes (BoxNetGraphView) The following modes are initiated by pressing the left mouse button, and generally remain active until the mouse button is released.  These modes can be cancelled by hitting the Esc key, in which case no action is taken (or the cancel behavior is as specified for that mode).  To indicate that the action is cancellable, and to speed up display,  ghost  (xor d) versions of a clicked-on UI element (box, socket, link, etc.) is generally manipulated while the mouse is dragged, until mouse-up (at which time the editing operation either commits or aborts, depending on circumstances). General Description select-rectangle(pt) The user is drawing an xor d rectangle around a collection of boxes, from point pt to the current mouse location.  On mouse-up, all boxes that intersect the rectangle in any way are selected. Mouse UI:  Left-down at point pt outside any box or link. Boxes And Sockets Description move-box-selection(b) The user is dragging a ghost copy of the box selection. Mouse UI:  Left-down on a box see move-box-selection-pending mode. move-box-selection-pending(b) While in this mode, if the user waits long enough, or drags the mouse far enough, the user enters move-box-selection mode.  If not (i.e. if the user releases the mouse button quickly, without dragging far) then if the user shift-clicked on b then the b is deselected. Mouse UI:  Left-down on box b. move-socket(s) A ghost copy of socket s (and its connected link, if any) is dragged around the perimeter of the s s box.  (see ghost-socket and ghost-link modes.)  If the user drags off the permiter, the ghost socket  snaps  back to its original position, until the mouse re-enters the permiter.  On mouse-up, s moves to the position of the ghost socket. Mouse UI:  Left-down on s while in allow-move-socket mode. Links And Bends Description insert-bend(l, pt) Let the user insert a new bend in link l at the point in l closest to pt.  Execute lGhost = l.Clone(), bGhost = new Bend, lGhost.InsertBend(bGhost, pt), begin move-ghost-bend(l, lGhost, bGhost). Mouse UI:  Left-down on or near l while in allow-edit-bends mode. insert-link(s) The user is  drawing  a link from unoccupied socket s to another empty socket.  Execute lGhost = new BoxLink, begin ghost-link(lGhost).  If mouse-up happens anywhere except an empty socket, the mode is cancelled with no action taken, and lGhost is destroyed.  Otherwise lGhost is linked from s to the second socket. Mouse UI:  Left-down in s and drag while not in allow-move-socket mode. move-bend(l, b) Bend b on link l is dragged to a new position.  Execute lGhost = l.Clone, bGhost = where b is on lGhost, begin move-ghost-bend(l, lGhost, bGhost). Mouse UI: Left-down on b while not in allow-edit-bends mode.  Also called from insert-bed mode. move-link(l, s) A ghost copy of the end of link l that s in socket s is dragged to a new socket.  If mouse-up happens anywhere except an empty socket, the mode is cancelled with no action taken.

Transient  Utility Modes  (BoxNetGraphView) The following are  utility modes , enabled by other modes: Boxes And Sockets Description ghost-box(bGhost) Box bGhost (which is not currently contained in the BoxNet data object) is displayed as a  ghost ghost-box-selection There is a ghost copy of the box selection, including all links connected to selected boxes.  The ghost selection offset by some offset from the original selection, and is the same size and shape as the original selection except that any link between a selected and an unselected box is shown in the ghost selection as still connected to the unselected box.  Used by move-box-selection mode.  See MoveGhostBoxSelection(). ghost-socket(sGhost) Socket sGhost (which is not currently contained in any box, i.e. no box points to it, though it may point to a parent box) is displayed as a  ghost socket-hilited(s) Socket s is shown  highlighted .

Conceptually, a box is an object contained in a box network. IBox State Information A box is contractually obligated to maintain the following information: a box label (any string, defined by the box implementation), a list of socket objects, each of which supports IBoxSocket. Implemented Interfaces (Box) Any box object needs to implement the following interfaces: Interface Implementation Information (Standard implementation.) IDispatch At a minimum, support methods and properties from IBox. IPersistStorage (Standard implementation.) IBox Interface IBox is defined as follows.  IBox is accessible from IDispatch. Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description (One method for each command listed in Section   REF _Ref285335050 \n  enumerate sockets, Label As String [r/w] box label NOT SetLabel, since boxes don t *have* to be able to be given a label (see ISimpleBox -- it does SetLabel) Commands (Box) Command Description move-socket(s, pos) Move socket s to position pos on the perimeter of its box. UI:  See move-socket mode. SimpleBox Object The SimpleBox object is a simple box implementation (supporting IBox).  SimpleBox simply contains a box label and an arbitrary number of labelled sockets there is no other semantic meaning.  SimpleBox can be: used as-is, with BoxNetXXX objects, to create simple  flowcharts  which can be displayed but which don t do anything else; subclassed, used with subclassed implementation of BoxNetXXX objects, to create box network applications (such as a filter sheet with audio filters).

Accel. Commands; {How To Update UI} Edit: Box Properties... Alt+Enter copy-selection; {CanCopy} BoxLink Object A BoxLink is an object that represents a link between two boxes in a box network. State Information (BoxLink) A BoxLink maintains the following information: an IBoxSocket pointer to the socket that the head of the link connects to; an IBoxSocket pointer to the socket that the tail of the link connects to; a list of Point values indicating the location of each bend in the link. Implemented Interfaces (BoxLink) Interface Implementation Information IBoxLink (Standard implementation.) IDispatch Methods and properties from IBoxLink. IPersistStorage (Standard implementation.) IBoxLink Interface Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description Clone() As BoxLink return a copy of link enumerate bends, etc. InsertBend(LinkBend b, Point pt) insert bend b into the link at the point closest to pt NewLink(BoxSocket h, BoxSocket t) As BoxLink (Class factory command)  Create a new link with no bends, with head pointing to socket h and tail pointing to socket t. Commands (BoxLink) Command Description delete-bend(b) Delete bend b. new-bend(pt) A new bend is inserted at the point on the link closest to point pt. BoxSocket Object A BoxSocket represents a point on a box that a link can be connected to. State Information (BoxSocket) A BoxSocket maintains the following information: a socket label (any string, defined by the socket implementation); a socket position of type BoxSocketPos; an IBox pointer to the box that contains the socket; an IBoxLink pointer to the link (if any) connected to the socket. Implemented Interfaces (BoxSocket) Interface Implementation Information IBoxSocket Interface IBoxSocket is defined as follows.  IBoxSocket is accessible from IDispatch. Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description SocketLabel As String [r/w] socket label SocketPos As BoxSocketPos [r/w] socket position Commands (BoxSocket) Command Description BoxSocketPos Object, BoxEdge Type A value class BoxSocketPos object represents the position of a box socket   along the perimeter of a box.  (A box tab is the graphical representation of a box network socket.)  The position is represented as a fraction of the length of the edge, so that resizing the box will retain the tab s relative position.  A BoxEdge is an enumerated type which labels each of the four edges of a box. IBoxSocketPos Interface, State Information IBoxSocketPos is defined as follows.  IBoxSocketPos is accessible from IDispatch. Method/Property [r=read, w=write] Description Edge As BoxEdge [r/w] Which edge contains the socket tab. Extent As Single[r/w] The location of the socket tab along the edge specified by Edge.  This is a floating-point fractional value: 0.0 means left/top, 1.0 means right/bottom. BoxEdge Enumerated Type BoxEdge enumerated type values are as follows. Value Description BottomEdge Box socket tab is on the bottom edge of box. LeftEdge Box socket tab is on the left edge of box. RightEdge Box socket tab is on the right edge of box. TopEdge Box socket tab is on the top edge of box. BoxNet Collection And Enumeration Objects The BoxNet architecture defines several IDispatch-enabled collection and enumeration object classes which are useful for navigating BoxNet object graphs.  These classes are summarized in the following table: Base Object Collection Enumerator Item() Parameter box-class Boxes EnumBoxes box name BoxSocket BoxSockets EnumBoxSockets socket label BoxLink BoxLinks EnumBoxLinks index Base Object  column shows the object that s contained in the collection.  The  Collection  column gives the name of the collection class.  The  Enumerator  column gives the name of the enumerator class (which implements IEnumVariant); an object of this class is created when the _NewEnum() method is called on the correpsonding collection object.  The  Item() Parameter  specifies what s given as the parameter of the Item() method of the corresponding collection.

I made quite a few changes to the implementation of IPropertyPageSite
in GraphEdt. This now reflects the protocol intended by OLE.

Refer to "\\ole\specs\draft\Interface Specification for OLE Controls.doc",
which is by far the best documentation I have found on this.

A few things I have noticed in existing property pages, which will break
with my new version.

IPropertyPage::TranslateAccelerator - should return E_NOTIMPL if it doesn't
        process any messages, S_FALSE if it doesn't use this message and
	S_OK if if this message was used.

IPropertyPage::SetObjects - If called with parameter 0 all
	addref'ed pointers from a previous SetObjects call should be released.

	SetObjects will be called twice. Once with the pointers, second time
	with 0 to release them.

	SetObjects should be for initialisation/clean up of the property
	page.

IPropertyPage::Show - can be used to show or hide the property page
	(when user is clicking between tabs). Only SW_SHOW, SW_SHOWNORMAL
	 and SW_HIDE are allowed as argument.

IPropertyPage::Activate - this can also be used to show and hide the property
	page and can therefore be used more than once during the lifetime
	of a property page. (it is actually the prefered mechanism to
	show/hide the pages, since memory is only needed for the visible
	page.

IPropertyPage::Deactivate - Destroys a window, but state of property
	page must be kept for next Activate call.

IPropertyPage::SetPageSite - This must addref the pointer given to it and
	release the pointer if the argument is NULL.

Please read the documentation from \\ole - it specifies which return codes
are allowed and which are not.

Jonathan has actually started (maybe even finished) to implement a class
which deals with most of these methods in order to make the property
pages easier and faster to create.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\multimedia\dshow\vidctl\deletedfiles.txt ===
as part of the security push we've deleted the following files.  
if anyone wants them back they should do a full security review


elementbehaviorimpl.h
htmlpainterimpl.h
msvidctl\rbfactory.h

these were used as the beginning of an attempt to expose vidctl as a binary element behavior.  
but this was never completed, and to reduce our security footprint and not have to implement
zone checking/security manager awareness for this method of object instantiation, we're just
taking it out altogether.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\multimedia\dshow\vidctl\readme.txt ===
this file provides a brief synopsis of the naming conventions, and purposes of other files in this directory.

dirs:
caman - conditional access manager
cagseg - conditional access graph segment.  eventually caman, cagseg should be the same object/project/dir.  ask
	 johnbrad for more details
atl - private versions of atl headers(see readme in that dir)
atlwin - copy of atlwin. this should eventually be replaced with public\sdk\inc\wtl
msvidctl - the actual core vidctl 
auxcfg - utility objects to support configuration of analog auxiliary input devices for s-video or composite.
         this is incomplete(as of 8/00) , but intended to be UI-less helper objects based on the win98
 	 webtv for windows config page and aux-in filter.

files:

w32extend.h

this file provides a set of utility classes that make various win32 api's and structs easier to use from c++.

fwdseq.h

this file is a generic template for turning any sort of com object with a reasonably standard enumerator into
an stl style container with an forward(restartable input) iterator.   its so complicated because its working
around a couple of compiler bugs and its flexible enough to handle most next method signatures and names.

ksextend.h

utility classes, templates for simplifying the use of ks from c++ client code.  this supports easy access to
ks medium structures. 

dsextend.h, .cpp
these files provide a set of extension classes for core dshow objects.  many of these utilize the services in 
the other *extend.h files.  this includes a set of templates for making graphs look like an stl collection
of filters, filters a collection of pins, pins a collection of media types, pins a collection of mediums, 
dshow device enumerators a collection of device monikers, and other utility functions.

XXXimpl.h
these files provide an atl style default implementation template for the interface IXXXX.

scalingrect.h
this files provides a utility class which auto scales rectangles via mapwindowpoints based on the associated
hwnd.

objreghelp.h
replacement helper macros for atl object registration.  this is still based on the underlying atl registration
mechanics, but it shares a common __declspec(selectany) string copy of the common .rgs with many other
macro substitutions besides %module%.  this simplifies object registration and reduces executable size.

odsstream.h
standard library iostream backed by outputdebugstring so that tracing can use standard c++ io(esp. manipulators).

filterenum.h
standard ole collection on stl vector based list of filters

stextend.h
utlity classes to provide additonal global operators for certain stl objects.

arity.h
generalize of stl unary and binary functor objects.  this allows(more or less)arbitrary function signatures
to be use with stl function application templates such as std::for_each and std::find_if.
this was done as an experiment with a more functional style programming paradigm.  i'm in the process of 
pulling all this out as time allows.  this seems to confuse people very badly and given the fact that the compiler
doesn't deduce arguments correctly much of the time, forcing explicitly typed instantiation, empirical evidence
suggests that this stuff negatively impacts readability.  i'm in the process of converting all the std::find_if
and std::for_each to explicit loops and then this won't be needed any more.

devseq.h
typedef def'd instantations of fwdseq for various type safe device collections

mtype.*
private copy of standard dshow base class.  we statically link with the crt to avoid a dependency on msvcp60.dll
strmbase.lib is built for use with msvcrt.dll instead of libc.lib.  due to dllimport definition differences, this
causes different name mangling for many imports, and is incompatible enough to be unlinkable.  therefore, since
we're a client and not a filter anway, we don't link with strmbase.  we only link with strmiids.lib.

errsupp.h
inline helper for rich ISupportErrorInfo type error message from XXXXimpl files.

seg.h
standard type safe support for various kinds of collections of device segments.

todo.txt
notes about future ideas for improvements or bug fixes needed in the code. also, notes about commonly made
mistakes that need to be frequently re-reviewed.

throw.h
internal exception hierarchy

trace.h, trace.cpp
internal tracing mechanism

tstring.h
internal string typedefs for providing independent tracing support that can be compile time switched between 
atlwin/wtl/mfc CString and c++ standard library std::basic_string.  unfortunately, std::basic_string is broken 
badly enough that this isn't tenable.  this file and its dependencies should eventually get removed.

vidrect.h
automation compliant com wrapper for scalingrect.h

`Continuing Review:
- make sure there are no [out] parms.  must be [in, out] or [out, retval]
- don't use leading underscore on names(except new enum) use attrs instead
- com categories including safe for scripting on all classes w/ object factory
	check regbag and tuner classes for this too.
- assignment operators/copy ctors in all atl smart ptr derived classes
- #pragma once in headers
- check non-extensible, non-createable attrs on .idl
- don't use hungarian in .idl it looks weird in vb object browser
- examine all VariantChangeType calls and make sure we're not doing any inplace calls on
  Variant* that are [in] only.  they don't belong to us and we shoudln't write to them.
  for example, they may be using a different heap than we are.
- new enum, ienumVARIANT.  make sure no ienumunknown or other types
- review // undone:
- review // REV2: to see if any can be moved to this version
- review E_NOTIMPL
- review cat maps to be sure eveyone has appropriate safe for scripting, etc.
- standard dispids

todo:
- missing default args on IMPLs that inherit from IDispatch
- make tuning requests use VT_BYREF for tuning space object and modify atlcom
	so this qi's for imoniker and saves a registry moniker
- figure out which properties should respond on propertynotifysink
- better errors when custom composition segments fail.
- figure out why graph build is only connecting composite between ati xbar and 829 xbar
  and, why it works anyway.
- decide what to do if vidprot can't get a def tr or something goes wrong in
  graph build.  do we try to fallback to some other form even if it doesn't have
  video so that at least there's a control object associated with the object tag?
- test hw slice codec analog graph build
- investigate atltrace showing up in release version
- stock readystatechange event on top level vidctl, state property to return graph state
- we need to figure out what the bug is that causes std::hex io maniuplator on our outputdebugstring iostream 
      support to start outputting floating point format for integers.  note, this only happens on unicode. i'm
      pretty sure that we're either missing or have incorrect some kind of overload for wchar in that case.
- set a flag in the bind context that allows us to call the tv: prot and just get a parsed tune request back
  instead of a new vidctl instance.  we can then use this if we get a view call for a BSTR.
- missing events: 
	EC_VIDEO_SIZE_CHANGED source size changed from video renderer, ontune from bda tuner.
	source size changed from video renderer, ontune from bda tuner.
- cat maps override IObjectSafety.  go through all objects and remove catid_safeforxxx and replace
  with IObjectSafetyImpl everywhere.  this is more consistent and should be faster since it saves
  having to hit the registry as much.

tuning model:
- tune.h helpers for componenttypes, components, and dvb
- status method on ITuner
- ontunerchangedevent, bcast event

spec:
- reflect imediaposition, don't pass through object.  we don't want script clients to ever have direct pointers to
      the graph.  we want to reserve the right to cache and swap graphs around as devices change in order to 
      optimize performance.  as things get more complicated, there will be trade-offs between change the existing
      graph dynamically and swapping entire graphs quickly.  we don't know what those heuristics are going to 
      be yet.  as long as we maintain wrappers around the real graph, we can change it under the covers at will.
- doc frame stepping and other mods to IPlaybackimpl
- do we want a plugable protocol vid:string rep of anything vid can view
- investigate:  we should possibly do an object based representation of dvd track/title, etc. this would allow
      us to leverage the sub stream components for karaoke, subpic, etc.  we would then move the dvd: url
      parsing that philliplu did up into the pluggable protocol and create a dvd object at that point.  then we 
      can treat dvd: exactly like tv: in the vidctl.  we should also figure out the assocation between these 
      objects and dvd bookmarks.  the advantage of having the parser in the protocol rather than the segment is
      that it allows view to optimize the device search by qi'ing for interfaces a ruling out or restricting the
      search to entire categories of devices instead of having to pass a string to every single device.
- do more comparison to existing media player and mci
- update tuning model. phys chan, msbda abbreviation, other stuff???

--------- future revisions -----------

tuning model:
- need to put default max prop size in ts w/ hidden restricted put_ in order to
  size limit check all the bstr properties to prevent dnos attacks that fill up the disk/registry.
  currently its a hardcoded 4k.
- currently, persisted tune requests make a copy of the tuning space values.  we need a registry moniker
    so that we can put a reference to the tuning space in the tune request.  this way if the a tuning
    space property changes all the tune requests will automatically reflect that change.
- fix component types persistence to use property bag in addition to pb2 and store count as an explicit property
- fix components collection to be persistable like

tuning model fixes that should be back-propped to dx 8.X:
- tune request object factories replaced for de-persisting
- VT_BSTR_BLOB change
- atl base class fix to not persist VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN with null pointer
- DVBS hierarchy change


vidctl:
- investigate IDispatchEX. should we use this instead?
- investigate updating enums to use atl enum on stl for possible code size saving
- figure out interface support needed for being an ie effects 'filter' object. ala dxtransform or be a behavior
- investigate vs7 stl and see what impact this will have on us ahead of time
- think about an arbitrary render file device
- fwdseq, iterator comparison is doing a valuetype compare.  this is semantically suspect.
  we should really keep a counter and state and compare numbers of calls to next and FAILED(hr) 
  instead of comparing returned values.
- investigate mouse wheel support.  might be cool for dvd menus.  might also be useful event to pass to clients
- go thru and remove all the atlwin stuff and replace it with references to wtl.
      this include deleting atlwin, fixing resulting compile errors, and taking out all the non-cstring support
      from tstring.h, we're commited to tstring now.
- go thru and see if we can fix our debug infrastructure to rely on dshow's.  we may need to add our iostream on
      outputdebugstring support.  on the other hand, this probably can't be done if it creates a dependency on
      msvcpxx.dll for dshow. 
- cleanup all the tstring stuff.  we're committed to cstring now and there's no need to try to keep the 
	ability to switch between cstring and std::string
- we should expose the ability to set the number of streams on the video renderer on IMSVidGraphSeg so that
  c++ apps can change the default from the current value of 4. although 4, should be sufficient 98% of the time
  video, subpic, cc, plus a spare.
- there's room for perf optimization by reducing the amount of work done repeatedly in every vrsegimpl VRConfig
  call.
- put_container should support moving to a different graph and caching the old graph so that if we go
  back to it that we can recover the previous state without an expensive rebuild
- currently we load both the dsound renderer and the wave-in device into the graph for the default audio renderer
  because we don't know if our source will be analog or digital.  we need to change this to use the ksproxied
  sys audio(wdm system audio renderer) which supports both as soon as the sysaudio proxy bugs are fixed and
  the clock rate matching resampling code has been moved from dsound renderer to sysaudio.
- we need a segment registration scheme instead of the hardcoded list we currently have in whistler
- outputs is completely untested since we don't have any yet.
- support dynamic graph building 
- props on video renderer to report back max stretch and decimation

perf optimizations:
- go through mswebdvd*.* and a bunch of throws can be changed to returns, with a try catch at outermost level thus
  removing a bunch of interior try/catch setups

private atl:
- propertybag_load case VT_CLSID
  in addition to VT_BSTR should also check for VT_CLSID and should attempt VariantChangeType 

event binder:
- now that we know the script engine is guaranteed to provide the script site via IObjectWithSite
  we should query back up into the dom and support using the event binder from createobject()
  as well as from an object tag.

these are the headers that must be placed ahead of public\sdk in order
to utilize atl improvements that i've made

- my version actually includes vc6 sp3 fixes which the sdk\inc\atl30 doesn't yet(as of 8/00).
- modified atlbase smart ptr classes to enable use of a custom stl allocator to allow ccomptr, ccomqiptr, 
	ccombstr, etc. to be placed by value into stl containers without converting to the 
	inefficient CAdapt class that lacks the operator& and thus causes an extra copy ctor generated 
	addref/release on every assignment and function call into or out of an stl container/iterator.
- property map chaining to allow base class persisted members to be specified in the base class impl templates.
- ctor/assignment support for additional types in CComVariant
- property bag load/save support for several additional VT_XXX types
- thread safety in the property bag support
- one line support for aggregating the free threaded marshaller(END_COM_MAP_WITH_FTM)
- thread safety for for collection and com enumerator on stl container support classes
- ocsncpy support in atlconv
- improvements to their .rgs script parser to allow me to use it to create a property bag on the rgs script so
          that i can self register objects much more easily using the existing
	  property map load stuff
- an assortment of misc bug fixes

I'm going to use the example of our Shell__Core.SLD file for this discussion, but you can replace all instances of "ShellCore" below with "DirectMusic" or "DirectShow" quite easily.
 
1) Annotate hivecls.inx, hivesft.inx, hivedef.inx with "@*:;begin_sld_ShellCore"/"@*:;end_sld_ShellCore" around the registry entries you want to include.  Note that these are prodfilt comment lines, so they have no effect on the actual hivecls.inf, hivesft.inf, hivedef.inf files generated for the core product.
2) Create a special SLD build directory and add "SLDFILES = ShellCore" and add "MISCFILES = $(SLDFILES)" to your Sources file.
3) In your makefile, !INCLUDE "makefile.sld" in addition to makefile.def
4) Building in this directory will generate ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf, ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings_ADS.inf (iff there are server-only settings), and ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings_PRO.inf (iff there are pro-only settings).
5) Take the generated inf files and use INF2SLD to convert them to .SLD files. (NOTE: once the new componentization tools are released this step can be automated -- eta 2 Sept.)
6) Check this ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf.SLD in right next to the Shell__Core.SLD file.  Note: the first time you do this, you need to add a registry key raw dependency in Shell__Core.SLD to one of the registry keys in ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf.SLD so you suck in the generated file whenever the original component is selected.


To get auto-build-machine support to let you know when someone changed a .inf line that requires you to update your .sld files, do this:
1) Copy the generated obj\i386\*.inf to .\*.inf and check them in.
2) Have your auto build machine build in the special SLD generation directory.
3) Whenever you get a build error, someone changed an .inf file without updating the .sld files.  Start at step 5 above.


Whenever you get a bug about a missin registry line from hiveXXX.inf, simply update your annotations and re-run the makefile.


Please let me know of any bugs you find with this process.


Thanks,

AVIFile: it's not just an API set, it's a way of life.

So, people are confused about how to approach the AVIFile APIs.
Let's try to help by making some things clear.


1.  AVIFile isn't just for AVI files.
Perhaps this would be clearer if these functions had some different
name, but let's live with AVIFile for now.  The important thing to
keep in mind is that we aren't talking about .AVI files, but about
some ideal time-based file format which supports the operations we'd
like it to support, like reading and writing from multiple
time-stamped streams.  If the APIs conform closely to what's actually
in .AVI files, it's just because I made up both the .AVI format and
the AVIFile APIs.

The guiding principle is that any other type of file containing this
time-stamped sort of data, be it a QuickTime file, an MPEG file, a
.WAV file, or whatever, should be accessible in one simple way.

2.  AVIFile isn't just for files.  
Having a uniform API to read these different sorts of files is
convenient, but we can go beyond that.  Once you have the abstract
concept of a "file" which is a bundle of "streams" (each of which has
a particular data type and format, along with a start time and
duration, and can be read from or written to at various points in
time), it is clear that not every "file" needs to correspond to an
actual disk file, and not every "stream" has to come from a "file" at
all.  

Useful kinds of streams to think about: 
Entirely synthetic streams, like the bouncing ball example; in this
case, a "stream" reduces to a function GiveMeVideoFrame(x).
Streams which are essentially filters applied to other streams; for
example, given a stream of video (that is, some abstract object that
can hand you frame 4 if you want it), you can build from that a
"compressed" stream, which is simply a stream that when asked for
frame 4 goes and asks the original stream for its frame 4, then
compresses it and hands it back to you, saying "here's frame 4, all
compressed like you wanted it." 

3.  AVIFile tries to conform to the Component Object model.
Since AVIFile is intended to be extensible to support additional file
formats, it has to have some way of transparently linking to DLLs
containing routines that understand those file formats.  In the past,
we in MMSys have done this sort of thing using installable drivers
and a message-based scheme.  (See MCI, ICM, and more....)  With the
release of OLE 2.0, we have a new standard for this sort of thing.
It's a little scary at first, requires either C++ or some C++-like
thinking, and involves header files you haven't seen before.  In any
case, we're all going to have to live with it.

4.  Don't be intimidated by talk of C++ and "objects".  

From a C point of view, all an "object pointer" like a PAVISTREAM is
is a pointer to a structure whose first member happens to be another
pointer to a table of functions.  This means that in addition to
carrying around data like "how long is this video sequence", the
structure also contains pointers to code that knows how to actually
get things done.  All C++ does for you is provide a nicer syntax for
doing this sort of thing.

You can make yourself a PAVISTREAM by hand.  All you have to do
is allocate room for a structure big enough to contain the pointer 
to the function table and any other data you need to keep around.
Then, you make a function table with the Read, Write, and other
functions to operate on your type of stream, and make sure your
structure points to your table.  Just like that, you have a bona fide
PAVISTREAM which you can pass to AVISave, AVIStreamRead, and so on.

5.  Luckily, you can usually ignore all of the "Component Object model"
stuff.
Unless you're doing something complicated, you should be able to just
call the various AVIFileXXXX and AVIStreamXXXX APIs and pretty much
ignore all of the talk of ISomethingOrOther and CLSID_Confusing.

If you are trying to make a DLL that will add support for reading and
writing a new file format, you will in fact have to learn something
about what a "class factory" is, but cross that bridge when you come
to it.

6.  AVISave() is just a helper function.
All the AVISave function does is copy some streams into a new file.
It doesn't do anything that you couldn't do yourself by calling the
AVIFileXXXX and AVIStreamXXXX APIs.  It does, however, make your life
easier by: calling AVIMakeCompressedStream for you according to the
options you pass in; calling AVIFileOpen and AVIFileCreateStream
appropriately to make the new streams in the new file you're making;
and finally, looping through all of the streams from start to end
copying the data from the old streams into the new file, and doing it
in the right order so that things come out nicely interleaved.

7.  AVIStreamReadData, AVIStreamWriteData, AVIFileReadData, and
AVIFileWriteData are not actually for reading and writing real data.
I know, these routines have bad names and they're just confusing
everybody.  

What they're not for: These routines are not what you use to read and
write audio samples and video frames and that sort of thing.  For
that, you must use AVIStreamRead and AVIStreamWrite.  (If you have a
PAVIFile, call AVIFileGetStream and then call AVIStreamRead.) 

What they're for: Reading and writing copyright information, the
author's name, and other stuff like that that's kept in INFO chunks
in RIFF files.

8.  AVIStreamGetFrame is just another helper function.
AVIStreamGetFrame (and AVIStreamGetFrameOpen/Close) are just
functions which handle the relatively simple task of getting a
decompressed video frame out of a stream.  This involves finding the
right ICM decompressor for the task at hand, figuring out where the
last key frame was, and decompressing frames as necessary.

Perhaps this should all be done automatically for you; perhaps you
should do this instead by opening a "decompressed" stream based on
the compressed stream you want to read.  It's not either of those
ways now, so use AVIStreamGetFrame.

8a. What in heck is AVIMakeCompressedStream() for?
AVIMakeCompressedStream makes a new stream pointer for you that acts
just like the old stream you already had, but is compressed or
decompressed.  That isn't very clear, so I'll try again: If you have
a PAVISTREAM which, when you read it, gives you back 8-bit RGB frames
of "Gone With the Wind", you can use AVIMakeCompressedStream to make
a stream that will return the same pictures, but compressed in, say,
CRAM format.  The reverse is also true: given a compressed stream,
AVIMakeCompressedStream can make you an uncompressed version of that
stream.

To use it, just fill out an AVICOMPRESSOPTIONS structure.  (Or pass
NULL, which will decompress.)

In theory, you can either read from the compressed stream or write to
it.  (Right now, this still doesn't work for audio compression....)
However, you can only do one at a time.



9.  What in the world is an HRESULT?  
For some reason, all OLE 2.0 functions return HRESULTs which could
potentially contain extra information about an error that occurred.
For now, they are essentially just the same as a plain error code.  
To convert one of the AVIERR_XXXX codes to an HRESULT, call 
ResultFromScode() on it.  To convert back, use GetScode()....

10.  In its current state, AVIFile is not finished.
Some things which are bad about the current AVIFile APIs:
AVISaveOptions() puts up a nasty big nested dialog which isn't
user-friendly. 
AVISave() doesn't handle palette changes correctly.
Almost nothing handles the concept of, say, a wave format changing
halfway through a stream.
T here is no way to find when the next palette change happens, short
of asking for the video format on every frame until you find a place
it changes.
Dealing with compressed and uncompressed streams is kind of screwy.
If you know exactly what you have and what you want, you can call
AVIMakeCompressedStream() to do what you need.
Right now, the handler for compressing streams only supports reading,
not writing.  There is no reason this should be true, and maybe I'll
fix it.
There are no status callbacks for anything.  If something takes a
really long time, you wait.
Error returns are generally bad, if they're there at all.
There is no way to find what a specific handler can do short of
trying to do it and seeing what works.
The documentation is still primitive.

11.  Miscellaneous hints:
Be sure to call AVIStreamInit() and AVIStreamExit().  If you don't,
the component object DLL won't get initialized and nothing will work.
Be sure the right information is in your registration database.  It
should all get put there automatically, but isn't too resistant to
tampering. 

Some functions take pointers to long variables which need to be initialized
to the size of your buffer before you call them.  You need to use code like:
cbSize = cbBuffer; AVIStreamReadFormat(pstream, 0, lpBuffer, &cbSize);
After this, cbSize will contain the actual correct size of the format, which 
you can then compare to the size you passed in to see if your buffer
was large enough.

NOTE:  The AVI read APIs are very preliminary and are totally unsupported by Microsoft Corp. at this time.   You are free to use the .lib and look at the sample code to figure out how to use these APIs to read data from AVI files.   We make no claims that this will be unchanged or become part of a final product.  






Reading AVI files

This document explains how to read and display frames of an AVI file from within an application.  There are functions to open up a certain stream of an AVI file, read frames of data from that stream, and get some information about the stream.  

You will come across the concept of streams many times when dealing with these API's.  Essentially, a video file can contain several different types of data, for instance a video sequence, an English soundtrack, and a French soundtrack.  For convenience, and to allow separate access to these components of a file, we refer to each of these as a separate stream, and when we open the file and get data from it, we tell it which stream we are interested in.

AVIVIEW.C  is a sample application that opens up every stream in an AVI file and displays the data for each stream in a window as a bunch of horizontal stripes of bitmaps (for a Video stream) and waveforms (for an Audio stream).  You can then scroll horizontally to see the data at any point in the file.

Opening a Stream in an AVI file

Once you know the filename of the AVI file, you open a stream with the AVIStreamOpen command:

PAVISTREAM AviStreamOpen(LPSTR szFile, DWORD fccType, LONG lParam, 						  PAVISTREAMHANDLER p)

szFile is the filename of the AVI file.  fccType is the type of stream.  The two choices for a regular AVI file are streamtypeVIDEO and streamtypeAUDIO.  An AVI file may also contain other types of streams.  The lParam is the number of the stream you want.  Zero is the first stream. If there is no type, the AVI handler will choose a stream for you.  If you specify a stream type, the AVI handler will give you a stream of that type.  The important thing to know is that you can call AviStreamOpen inside a loop with successively greater values for lParam, and open every stream in the file (or every stream of a given type).  As soon as the call returns NULL you have run out of streams.  If you are reading an ordinary AVI file, you can pass NULL for the PAVISTREAMHANDLER, to indicate that you want AVI to use its default handler.

If, however, you are opening a non-AVI file and wish to use these read APIs to access the data in that file even though it is not really an AVI file, you can... IF someone has written a stream handler for that type of file.  Ordinarily, you would pass NULL for the PAVISTREAMHANDLER for reading standard AVI files, but in this case you would pass a pointer to a handler that understood the type of file you were reading.  For information about writing a custom stream handler, see the document entitled "Using Custom Stream Handlers".  AVIVIEW.C uses these same APIs to read both AVI files (using the default handler) and to read an imaginary BALL file (using the custom stream handler "BALL" described in the document "Using Custom Stream Handlers").

AVIStreamOpen returns a pointer to a stream which you use in all subsequent calls to read data or get information or set options for that stream.

Here is the code fragment that AVIVIEW.C uses to open every stream (regardless of type) of the file "szFile" and remember the stream pointers returned by the Open function in an array:


gcpavi = 0;		//how many streams are opened

for (i = 0; i < MAXNUMSTREAMS; i++, gcpavi++) {
        gapavi[i] = AVIStreamOpen(szFile, 0L, i, NULL);
	if (gapavi[i] == NULL)
	    break;
    }


LONG AVIStreamAddRef(PAVISTREAM pavi)

This function increases the reference count of a stream pointer you have opened with AVIStreamOpen, if, for example, you are passing the pointer to a function that will be closing the stream, and you wish to keep the stream open.  You must call AVIStreamClose once for the AVIStreamOpen call, and once for every reference count increase you make with AVIStreamAddRef.




Closing a Stream

Once you are done reading from the stream, you close it by calling 

AVIStreamRelease(pavi);

You need to individually close every stream of the file that you opened.




Getting information about a Stream

Use the call:

LONG AVIStreamInfo(pavi, &avis, sizeof(avis))

to fill an AVIStreamHeader structure with information about a stream you have opened.  Use the stream pointer returned by the open call.  If you pass NULL for &avis, the function will return the size of the AVIStreamHeader structure.  Here is the information you get about a stream in an AVIStreamHeader:


typedef struct {
    DWORD               fccType;		// eg. streamtypeVIDEO
    DWORD               fccHandler; 
    DWORD               dwFlags;		// Contains AVITF_* flags
    DWORD               dwPriority;		
    DWORD               dwInitialFrames;
    DWORD               dwScale;        
    DWORD               dwRate; 		// dwRate / dwScale ==
								samples/second
    DWORD               dwStart;
    DWORD               dwLength;		// In units above...
    DWORD               dwSuggestedBufferSize;
    DWORD               dwQuality;
    DWORD               dwSampleSize;
    RECT                rcFrame;
    DWORD			dwEditCount;
    DWORD			dwFormatChangeCount;
    char			szName[64];
} AVISTREAMINFO;

For more information about the fields of this structure, see the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 4: AVI Files.  


Getting the Format of the Stream Data

LONG AVIStreamReadFormat(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos, 
				LPVOID lpFormat,  LONG cbFormat)

This function will return a format structure telling you about the data at a given position in the stream (a sample number for audio streams, or a frame number for video streams).  For a video stream, the buffer will be filled with an LPBI, with the palette information following it (if applicable) but NO DATA BITS.  For an audio stream, you will get a PCMWAVEFORMAT structure.  For a different type of stream, you will get whatever format data is associated with that type.

If you pass in a NULL buffer, the function will return the size of the buffer it needs to give you the format data.  The function always returns the number of bytes of information placed in the buffer.

For example, if you wanted to know the frame size or the bit depth or the palette being used by a given frame of the AVI's video stream, this function will return an LPBI that you could examine.  This function can also be used to determine the sample rate or quantization of the the audio.




Reading Data From a Stream

There are several ways to read data from a stream:

LONG AVIStreamRead(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lStart, LONG lSamples,
				LPVOID lpBuffer, LONG cbBuffer,
				LONG FAR * plBytes, LONG FAR * plSamples)


This function will read raw data from the stream into a buffer you supply.  You give the start sample (frame) and the number of samples (frames) to read.  The function can return the number of samples read, and also the number of bytes read (to store that many samples).

If you do not supply a buffer, the function will return the number of bytes required to store the sample data you request.

This function returns raw data.  For a video stream, this will be the bits that make up the image (that need to be placed after the LPBI returned by AVIStreamReadFormat to make up the DIB).  This image may be compressed and useless to you until you decompress the image into something you can display using the Image Compression Manager (ICM) described in the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 2: Using the Installable Compression Manager.  The type of compression will be indicated by the LPBI returned by the AVIStreamReadFormat call.  For a video stream, the length parameter lSamples is ignored, and the buffer is only filled with data for a single frame.

For an audio stream, the data returned will be actual wave samples.  These wave samples may also be compressed.  The compression type is indicated in the PCMWAVEFORMAT returned by the AVIStreamReadFormat call.


LPVOID AVIStreamGetFrame(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos)


If you don't want the hassle of reading the format and the data bits for a video stream and then handling the decompression yourself, the above call will do all of this for you.  If the frame of video you are reading depends on data in previous frames to make up its image, this function will also read all the data since the previous key frame up until the frame you specify to build up the entire image for the frame you request.  

AVIStreamGetFrame takes a pointer to a video stream, and a position (frame number) in the file and returns an LPBITMAPINFOHEADER which points to a valid uncompressed DIB that can be displayed using standard Windows calls, or using the DrawDib routines which handle images of different bit depths, and automatic dithering for displays that can't handle certain types of DIBS.  The DrawDib functions are described separately in the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 3: Using the DrawDib Functions.

LPVOID AVIStreamReadData(PAVISTREAM pavi, DWORD fcc, LPVOID lp,
					LONG cb)

Not implemented.  To be announced.



Finding Key Frames, Non-empty frames, or Format Changes in a Stream

AVIStreamFindSample(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos, LONG lFlags)

This function will start at the position in the file that you specify, and search forwards or backwards (depending on the flags set) for the nearest key frame, non-empty frame, or format change, and return that frame number.

The possible flags for search direction are FIND_PREV and FIND_NEXT.  Both of these flags will return lPos if the sample given qualifies.

The possible flags for search item are FIND_KEY, FIND_ANY, or FIND_FORMAT.


Positioning Within a Stream

LONG AVIStreamStart(PAVISTREAM pavi)

will return the sample (frame) number of the first sample in the stream.  Use this number with the read functions to access the first  sample of data.  (For instance, the frames of a movie may be counted starting at zero or one depending on the preference of the author).  This value can also be found in the AVISTREAMHEADER structure returned by the AVIStreamInfo call.

LONG AVIStreamLength(PAVISTREAM pavi)

will return the number of frames (or samples) in the stream.  This value can also be found in the AVISTREAMHEADER structure returned by the AVIStreamInfo call.

LONG AVIStreamSampleToTime(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lSample)

will take a sample (frame) number of an AVI stream, and return the time, in milliseconds, associated with that sample.  For a video frame, this will be the time, offset from zero for the start of the movie, that this frame will appear when the AVI is played at its proper speed.  For an audio sample number, this will be time that the particular sample will be heard.

LONG AVIStreamTimeToSample(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lTime)

is the opposite of AVIStreamSampleToTime.  It is more accurate to deal with the position of a file using its sample number, since the time in milliseconds is only an approximation of when an event is taking place.  These functions are not true inverses, as two consecutive samples of audio may both be heard in the same millisecond, and converting the time value back to a sample number may give a different sample number than the original one.



Helper Macros

There are also a number of macros available that combine the functionality of the above functions to make it easier for you to perform certain common tasks.  These macros are listed below, followed by the code they translate to, along with an explanation.


AVIStreamSampleToSample(pavi1, pavi2, lSample) :=
           AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi1,AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi2, lSample))

Given a sample in the stream pavi2, this will return the sample in pavi1 that occurs at the same time as the given sample.

AVIStreamNextSampleTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t) + 1)

This macro will tell you when the sample occuring at the time you provide will change to the next sample.  Basically, it informs you of the next "interesting" time in the stream.

AVIStreamPrevSampleTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t) - 1)

This macro is similar to AVIStreamNextSampleTime, but looks at the time for the sample that comes BEFORE the time you provide.






AVIStreamNextKeyFrameTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi,
		AVIStreamFindKeyFrame(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t), 			SEARCH_FORWARD))

This macro returns the time of the next key frame in the stream, starting at a given time that you provide.

AVIStreamPrevKeyFrameTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi,
		AVIStreamFindKeyFrame(pavi,AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t), 			SEARCH_BACKWARD))

This macro returns the time of the most recent key frame that occured before the time that you provide.

AVIStreamStartTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamStart(pavi))

This macro returns the starting time of the stream's first sample.

AVIStreamLengthTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamLength(pavi))

This macro returns the length of the stream in time, not samples.

AVIStreamEnd(pavi) :=
            (AVIStreamStart(pavi) + AVIStreamLength(pavi))

This macro returns the sample number associated with the end of the stream.  This sample number is not a valid sample number to be read, but represents the end of the file.

AVIStreamEndTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamEnd(pavi))

This macro returns the time representing the end of the stream.

AVIStreamSampleSize(pavi, lPos) :=
	    AVIStreamRead(pavi, lPos, 1, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL)

This macro returns the size of the buffer needed to store one sample of information from this stream (the sample at the position you provide)

.

AVIStreamFormatSize(pavi, lPos) :=
            AVIStreamReadFormat(pavi, lPos, NULL, 0)

This macro returns the size of the buffer needed to store the format information for the sample at the position that you provide.

Things to do in AVIFile:

Need handlers for:
	Quicktime files
	Targa files
	JPEG files
	MPEG files

Improve streaming interface

Speed improvements:
	Use GlobalDosAlloc for buffers?
	Read several frames at one time?

Current bugs:
	Error returns are lousy.


More things to do:
	Automatically generate open/save filter strings.  This would 
	require that we put something in the regdb to indicate which 
	handlers supported writing....

	Should there be some way to pass AVIFileOpen an HMMIO?  An
	IStorage or IStream?

	It would be nice to have some way to be notified when the contents
	of a stream change....  Look at IAdviseHolder

	ReadData and WriteData need to be renamed, because they
	confuse everybody.  Also, need better method for accessing
	DISP and LIST `INFO' chunks.

	Stream names need to be better supported.

	During long operations, we need some kind of status callback.

	Should everything have version numbers?

	"capabilities": Additional information via AVIFile/StreamInfo
	about what the handler can do

	Do handlers need parameters somehow?  Some way to configure
	stuff for a particular file format?  Am I deluding myself into
	thinking I can get away without this stuff?

	More thought is needed about "non-seekable" streams.  For
	instance: can a video capture device be thought of as a
	stream? 

	Can making a stream handler be made easier?  One thought: a
	C++ base class for a stream handler which people could
	override only the methods they want....

	How can you change the rectangle for a stream?
	Do we need an AVIStreamSetInfo command?


	Can we make streams be named?  Instead of opening streams by type 
	and number, people could enumerate the streams in a file and open
	them by name....  Looks more and more like IStorage....


	Everything needs to be renamed.  Functions shouldn't all
	start with "AVI".

	We need a new interface to handle change notifications.  Copy
	OLE Advise Holders, Advise Sinks.


	Marshal the AVIFile reader in the following way:
	Right before reading from an HMMIO, check the current task.
	Re-open the file for each new HTASK....

	Some way of getting an error string from an error value would
	be good.


	I don't really use the IEditStream interface for everything.
	I should make Vtbls for the editstrm.c implementation, and allow
	other handlers to support the stuff.

	How can you use ReadData/WriteData to deal with more than one
	chunk with the same ID?  How about INFO chunks?


Old Stuff that's done:

	Does AVIStreamWrite need some way of returning how much of the
	data was actually written?  (Particularly in the case where
	it's doing ACM compression, it may only be able to write out 
	whole blocks of data....)


	EditStreamSetName
	EditStreamClone

	AVIStreamInfo could use a different structure than an
	AVIStreamHeader.  In particular, the structure could lose
	some useless fields and gain the stream name.  Same with
	AVIFileInfo. 

	During long operations, we need some kind of status callback.	


	Look at using IAVIFile, IAVIStream on the clipboard along with
	IDataObject.  This seems to require some work to "marshal"
	the interface from app to app....

	Given an open IAVIFile handle, retrieve its "file format", that
	is, some user-readable name for what kind of file it is....

	It would be nice to be able to write to the compression streams

	The options dialog doesn't make me happy....

Using AVIFile.


Initializing the AVIFile DLL:
Before using any of the APIs in AVIFILE.DLL, be sure to 
call AVIStreamInit.  After using them, call AVIStreamExit.
If you don't, bad things will happen.


Using AVIFile to read some kind of file: 

First, call AVIFileOpen with the OF_READ flag to open the file.
Then, you can call AVIFileInfo to find out how many streams are in
the file, and AVIFileGetStream to retrieve the streams you want.

Once you have a stream, you can can AVIStreamReadFormat to get the
bitmap format or wave format, and then call AVIStreamRead to actually
read the data you want.





AVIFile and the Component Object model:

The AVIFile APIs include two interfaces, IAVIFile and IAVIStream,
which work with the Component Object model which is part of OLE 2.0.

Class IDs
Each server or DLL that handles these interfaces needs to have a
Globally Unique ID (GUID), so that it can be distinguished from all
other handlers.  OLE uses 16-byte identifiers for this purpose.  If
you're making a new handler, you can run the UUIDGEN program to make
yourself a unique ID.

The Registration Database
The registration database is essentially just a replacement for .INI
files.  To look at what's going on in it, run "regedit -v".

DLLs which implement the IAVIFile and IAVIStream interfaces all need
to be listed in the registration database so that they can be found
when necessary.

Each DLL must be listed in the registration database by class ID,
with entries of the form:


HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = Wave File reader/writer
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\InprocServer = wavefile.dll

where HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is the root of the entire registration
database.  The InProcServer entry indicates that wavefile.dll can be
loaded within an application to implement the class in question.

The AVIFile library uses additional entries in the registration
database in order to know which handler to use by default to open a
given file.  If the file is a RIFF file, 

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\Extensions\WAV = {00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\RIFFHandlers\WAVE = {00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

You get a GUID by running the uuidgen.exe program that comes
with the SDK; it will spit out a 16-byte hex number for you.  You then
make a file with a .REG extension that looks like:
REGEDIT
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002} = JFIF (JPEG) Files 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002}\InprocServer =jfiffile.dll
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\Extensions\JPG = {5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002}

(Of course, use your GUID here.)  Then, on a user's machine, they can run
regedit -s whatever.reg and these definitions will get added to the 
registration database, allowing the system to find your DLL and know what
sorts of files it can load.



What are IAVIFile and IAVIStream?
(Note: you may just want to read the OLE 2 documentation here....)

These are examples of "interfaces".  An interface is a collection of 
"methods".





Implementing a handler DLL



IClassFactory
Obviously, it isn't enough for OLE to know the name of your DLL; some
standard entry point is required to establish communications.  The
method through which COMPOBJ.DLL does this isn't exactly
straightforward.  A handler DLL must export a DllGetClassObject
function; COMPOBJ calls that function to ask the DLL to return an
instance of the IClassFactory interface, which it then uses to
actually acquire an instance of the IAVIFile interface that we
actually care about.


Single-stream vs. Multi-stream
AVI files obviously support more than one stream of data in each
file.  Wave files, for example, are much simpler, in that they only
can have exactly one stream of audio.  This means that we only need
one stream object around, and we can make things even simpler by
having the same object support both the stream and file interfaces.

If you know that your handler will support, say, exactly one audio
and one video stream, things are also simpler than the completely
general case, because when you create your file object, you know that 
you will have to create exactly two stream objects.


Read-only vs. Read-write

A handler can be written which only supports reading or writing; you
can always return an error code from any method.  (One suggestion:
don't return unsupported from the FindSample function, but rather
just return that every frame is a key frame, every frame is non-empty, and 
that the only format change is frame 0)


Using C++
These handlers don't actually need to be implemented using C++; it
was just easier that way.


Installing your handler:
For your handler to be found, it needs to have the appropriate
entries in the registration database.
















Compression DLLs
When you call AVIMakeCompressedStream, you pass in a PAVISTREAM and
are returned another PAVISTREAM.  This new stream can be used in two
ways: either you can read from the stream, in which case you will
read data which is compressed from the original stream, or you can
write to the new stream, in which case the data you write will be
compressed and written to the original stream.

To use the "read" method, you would use the following sequence of
calls: (extra parameters left out because I can't remember them at
the moment)
AVIFileOpen(&pf, "foo.avi",...)
AVIFileGetStream(pf, &ps, ...)  
AVIMakeCompressedStream(ps, &psC, &options, ...)
AVIStreamReadFormat(psC, lpFormatC, &cbFormatC) // get compressed format
for (loop through frames)
	AVIStreamRead(psC, frame, ....)  // read compressed frames

To use the "write" method:
AVIFileOpen(&pf, "foo.avi", OF_CREATE | OF_WRITE...)
AVIFileCreateStream(pf, &ps, &strhdr, ....)
AVIMakeCompressedStream(ps, &psU, &options, ...)
AVIStreamSetFormat(psU, lpFormatU, cbFormatU) // set format of data
					// to compress
for (loop through frames)
	AVIStreamWrite(psU, frame, ....)  // write uncompressed frames,
					// which will be compressed and
					// written to the file





Using the Clipboard functions

The clipboard functions are easy.  To copy a bunch of streams to
the clipboard, call AVIMakeFileFromStreams to bundle them up into a
single PAVIFILE, then call AVIPutFileOnClipboard.  To get data off of
the clipboard, call AVIGetFromClipboard.  To see whether any data is
present on the clipboard, for enabling menus or such, you can just
call AVIGetFromClipboard to see if it returns anything, and release
any file it returns.

AVIFile: it's not just an API set, it's a way of life.

So, people are confused about how to approach the AVIFile APIs.
Let's try to help by making some things clear.


1.  AVIFile isn't just for AVI files.
Perhaps this would be clearer if these functions had some different
name, but let's live with AVIFile for now.  The important thing to
keep in mind is that we aren't talking about .AVI files, but about
some ideal time-based file format which supports the operations we'd
like it to support, like reading and writing from multiple
time-stamped streams.  If the APIs conform closely to what's actually
in .AVI files, it's just because I made up both the .AVI format and
the AVIFile APIs.

The guiding principle is that any other type of file containing this
time-stamped sort of data, be it a QuickTime file, an MPEG file, a
.WAV file, or whatever, should be accessible in one simple way.

2.  AVIFile isn't just for files.  
Having a uniform API to read these different sorts of files is
convenient, but we can go beyond that.  Once you have the abstract
concept of a "file" which is a bundle of "streams" (each of which has
a particular data type and format, along with a start time and
duration, and can be read from or written to at various points in
time), it is clear that not every "file" needs to correspond to an
actual disk file, and not every "stream" has to come from a "file" at
all.  

Useful kinds of streams to think about: 
Entirely synthetic streams, like the bouncing ball example; in this
case, a "stream" reduces to a function GiveMeVideoFrame(x).
Streams which are essentially filters applied to other streams; for
example, given a stream of video (that is, some abstract object that
can hand you frame 4 if you want it), you can build from that a
"compressed" stream, which is simply a stream that when asked for
frame 4 goes and asks the original stream for its frame 4, then
compresses it and hands it back to you, saying "here's frame 4, all
compressed like you wanted it." 

3.  AVIFile tries to conform to the Component Object model.
Since AVIFile is intended to be extensible to support additional file
formats, it has to have some way of transparently linking to DLLs
containing routines that understand those file formats.  In the past,
we in MMSys have done this sort of thing using installable drivers
and a message-based scheme.  (See MCI, ICM, and more....)  With the
release of OLE 2.0, we have a new standard for this sort of thing.
It's a little scary at first, requires either C++ or some C++-like
thinking, and involves header files you haven't seen before.  In any
case, we're all going to have to live with it.

4.  Don't be intimidated by talk of C++ and "objects".  

From a C point of view, all an "object pointer" like a PAVISTREAM is
is a pointer to a structure whose first member happens to be another
pointer to a table of functions.  This means that in addition to
carrying around data like "how long is this video sequence", the
structure also contains pointers to code that knows how to actually
get things done.  All C++ does for you is provide a nicer syntax for
doing this sort of thing.

You can make yourself a PAVISTREAM by hand.  All you have to do
is allocate room for a structure big enough to contain the pointer 
to the function table and any other data you need to keep around.
Then, you make a function table with the Read, Write, and other
functions to operate on your type of stream, and make sure your
structure points to your table.  Just like that, you have a bona fide
PAVISTREAM which you can pass to AVISave, AVIStreamRead, and so on.

5.  Luckily, you can usually ignore all of the "Component Object model"
stuff.
Unless you're doing something complicated, you should be able to just
call the various AVIFileXXXX and AVIStreamXXXX APIs and pretty much
ignore all of the talk of ISomethingOrOther and CLSID_Confusing.

If you are trying to make a DLL that will add support for reading and
writing a new file format, you will in fact have to learn something
about what a "class factory" is, but cross that bridge when you come
to it.

6.  AVISave() is just a helper function.
All the AVISave function does is copy some streams into a new file.
It doesn't do anything that you couldn't do yourself by calling the
AVIFileXXXX and AVIStreamXXXX APIs.  It does, however, make your life
easier by: calling AVIMakeCompressedStream for you according to the
options you pass in; calling AVIFileOpen and AVIFileCreateStream
appropriately to make the new streams in the new file you're making;
and finally, looping through all of the streams from start to end
copying the data from the old streams into the new file, and doing it
in the right order so that things come out nicely interleaved.

7.  AVIStreamReadData, AVIStreamWriteData, AVIFileReadData, and
AVIFileWriteData are not actually for reading and writing real data.
I know, these routines have strange names and they're just confusing
everybody.  

What they're not for: These routines are not what you use to read and
write audio samples and video frames and that sort of thing.  For
that, you must use AVIStreamRead and AVIStreamWrite.  (If you have a
PAVIFile, call AVIFileGetStream and then call AVIStreamRead.) 

What they're for: Reading and writing copyright information, the
author's name, and other stuff like that that's kept in INFO chunks
in RIFF files.

8.  AVIStreamGetFrame is just another helper function.
AVIStreamGetFrame (and AVIStreamGetFrameOpen/Close) are just
functions which handle the relatively simple task of getting a
decompressed video frame out of a stream.  This involves finding the
right ICM decompressor for the task at hand, figuring out where the
last key frame was, and decompressing frames as necessary.

Perhaps this should all be done automatically for you; perhaps you
should do this instead by opening a "decompressed" stream based on
the compressed stream you want to read.  It's not either of those
ways now, so use AVIStreamGetFrame.

8a. What in heck is AVIMakeCompressedStream() for?
AVIMakeCompressedStream makes a new stream pointer for you that acts
just like the old stream you already had, but is compressed or
decompressed.  That isn't very clear, so I'll try again: If you have
a PAVISTREAM which, when you read it, gives you back 8-bit RGB frames
of "Gone With the Wind", you can use AVIMakeCompressedStream to make
a stream that will return the same pictures, but compressed in, say,
CRAM format.  The reverse is also true: given a compressed stream,
AVIMakeCompressedStream can make you an uncompressed version of that
stream.

To use it, just fill out an AVICOMPRESSOPTIONS structure.  (Or pass
NULL, which will decompress.)

In theory, you can either read from the compressed stream or write to
it.  (Right now, this still doesn't work for audio compression....)
However, you can only do one at a time.



9.  What in the world is an HRESULT?  
For some reason, all OLE 2.0 functions return HRESULTs which could
potentially contain extra information about an error that occurred.
For now, they are essentially just the same as a plain error code.  
To convert one of the AVIERR_XXXX codes to an HRESULT, call 
ResultFromScode() on it.  To convert back, use GetScode()....

10.  In its current state, AVIFile is not finished.
Some things which are bad about the current AVIFile APIs:
AVISaveOptions() puts up a nasty big nested dialog which isn't
user-friendly. 
AVISave() doesn't handle palette changes correctly.
Almost nothing handles the concept of, say, a wave format changing
halfway through a stream.
T here is no way to find when the next palette change happens, short
of asking for the video format on every frame until you find a place
it changes.
Dealing with compressed and uncompressed streams is kind of screwy.
If you know exactly what you have and what you want, you can call
AVIMakeCompressedStream() to do what you need.
Right now, the handler for compressing streams only supports reading,
not writing.  There is no reason this should be true, and maybe I'll
fix it.
There are no status callbacks for anything.  If something takes a
really long time, you wait.
Error returns are generally not good, if they're there at all.
There is no way to find what a specific handler can do short of
trying to do it and seeing what works.
The documentation is still primitive.

11.  Miscellaneous hints:
Be sure to call AVIStreamInit() and AVIStreamExit().  If you don't,
the component object DLL won't get initialized and nothing will work.
Be sure the right information is in your registration database.  It
should all get put there automatically, but isn't too resistant to
tampering. 

Some functions take pointers to long variables which need to be initialized
to the size of your buffer before you call them.  You need to use code like:
cbSize = cbBuffer; AVIStreamReadFormat(pstream, 0, lpBuffer, &cbSize);
After this, cbSize will contain the actual correct size of the format, which 
you can then compare to the size you passed in to see if your buffer
was large enough.

NOTE:  The AVI read APIs are very preliminary and are totally unsupported by Microsoft Corp. at this time.   You are free to use the .lib and look at the sample code to figure out how to use these APIs to read data from AVI files.   We make no claims that this will be unchanged or become part of a final product.  






Reading AVI files

This document explains how to read and display frames of an AVI file from within an application.  There are functions to open up a certain stream of an AVI file, read frames of data from that stream, and get some information about the stream.  

You will come across the concept of streams many times when dealing with these API's.  Essentially, a video file can contain several different types of data, for instance a video sequence, an English soundtrack, and a French soundtrack.  For convenience, and to allow separate access to these components of a file, we refer to each of these as a separate stream, and when we open the file and get data from it, we tell it which stream we are interested in.

AVIVIEW.C  is a sample application that opens up every stream in an AVI file and displays the data for each stream in a window as a bunch of horizontal stripes of bitmaps (for a Video stream) and waveforms (for an Audio stream).  You can then scroll horizontally to see the data at any point in the file.

Opening a Stream in an AVI file

Once you know the filename of the AVI file, you open a stream with the AVIStreamOpen command:

PAVISTREAM AviStreamOpen(LPSTR szFile, DWORD fccType, LONG lParam, 						  PAVISTREAMHANDLER p)

szFile is the filename of the AVI file.  fccType is the type of stream.  The two choices for a regular AVI file are streamtypeVIDEO and streamtypeAUDIO.  An AVI file may also contain other types of streams.  The lParam is the number of the stream you want.  Zero is the first stream. If there is no type, the AVI handler will choose a stream for you.  If you specify a stream type, the AVI handler will give you a stream of that type.  The important thing to know is that you can call AviStreamOpen inside a loop with successively greater values for lParam, and open every stream in the file (or every stream of a given type).  As soon as the call returns NULL you have run out of streams.  If you are reading an ordinary AVI file, you can pass NULL for the PAVISTREAMHANDLER, to indicate that you want AVI to use its default handler.

If, however, you are opening a non-AVI file and wish to use these read APIs to access the data in that file even though it is not really an AVI file, you can... IF someone has written a stream handler for that type of file.  Ordinarily, you would pass NULL for the PAVISTREAMHANDLER for reading standard AVI files, but in this case you would pass a pointer to a handler that understood the type of file you were reading.  For information about writing a custom stream handler, see the document entitled "Using Custom Stream Handlers".  AVIVIEW.C uses these same APIs to read both AVI files (using the default handler) and to read an imaginary BALL file (using the custom stream handler "BALL" described in the document "Using Custom Stream Handlers").

AVIStreamOpen returns a pointer to a stream which you use in all subsequent calls to read data or get information or set options for that stream.

Here is the code fragment that AVIVIEW.C uses to open every stream (regardless of type) of the file "szFile" and remember the stream pointers returned by the Open function in an array:


gcpavi = 0;		//how many streams are opened

for (i = 0; i < MAXNUMSTREAMS; i++, gcpavi++) {
        gapavi[i] = AVIStreamOpen(szFile, 0L, i, NULL);
	if (gapavi[i] == NULL)
	    break;
    }


LONG AVIStreamAddRef(PAVISTREAM pavi)

This function increases the reference count of a stream pointer you have opened with AVIStreamOpen, if, for example, you are passing the pointer to a function that will be closing the stream, and you wish to keep the stream open.  You must call AVIStreamClose once for the AVIStreamOpen call, and once for every reference count increase you make with AVIStreamAddRef.




Closing a Stream

Once you are done reading from the stream, you close it by calling 

AVIStreamRelease(pavi);

You need to individually close every stream of the file that you opened.




Getting information about a Stream

Use the call:

LONG AVIStreamInfo(pavi, &avis, sizeof(avis))

to fill an AVIStreamHeader structure with information about a stream you have opened.  Use the stream pointer returned by the open call.  If you pass NULL for &avis, the function will return the size of the AVIStreamHeader structure.  Here is the information you get about a stream in an AVIStreamHeader:


typedef struct {
    DWORD               fccType;		// eg. streamtypeVIDEO
    DWORD               fccHandler; 
    DWORD               dwFlags;		// Contains AVITF_* flags
    DWORD               dwPriority;		
    DWORD               dwInitialFrames;
    DWORD               dwScale;        
    DWORD               dwRate; 		// dwRate / dwScale ==
								samples/second
    DWORD               dwStart;
    DWORD               dwLength;		// In units above...
    DWORD               dwSuggestedBufferSize;
    DWORD               dwQuality;
    DWORD               dwSampleSize;
    RECT                rcFrame;
    DWORD			dwEditCount;
    DWORD			dwFormatChangeCount;
    char			szName[64];
} AVISTREAMINFO;

For more information about the fields of this structure, see the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 4: AVI Files.  


Getting the Format of the Stream Data

LONG AVIStreamReadFormat(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos, 
				LPVOID lpFormat,  LONG cbFormat)

This function will return a format structure telling you about the data at a given position in the stream (a sample number for audio streams, or a frame number for video streams).  For a video stream, the buffer will be filled with an LPBI, with the palette information following it (if applicable) but NO DATA BITS.  For an audio stream, you will get a PCMWAVEFORMAT structure.  For a different type of stream, you will get whatever format data is associated with that type.

If you pass in a NULL buffer, the function will return the size of the buffer it needs to give you the format data.  The function always returns the number of bytes of information placed in the buffer.

For example, if you wanted to know the frame size or the bit depth or the palette being used by a given frame of the AVI's video stream, this function will return an LPBI that you could examine.  This function can also be used to determine the sample rate or quantization of the the audio.




Reading Data From a Stream

There are several ways to read data from a stream:

LONG AVIStreamRead(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lStart, LONG lSamples,
				LPVOID lpBuffer, LONG cbBuffer,
				LONG FAR * plBytes, LONG FAR * plSamples)


This function will read raw data from the stream into a buffer you supply.  You give the start sample (frame) and the number of samples (frames) to read.  The function can return the number of samples read, and also the number of bytes read (to store that many samples).

If you do not supply a buffer, the function will return the number of bytes required to store the sample data you request.

This function returns raw data.  For a video stream, this will be the bits that make up the image (that need to be placed after the LPBI returned by AVIStreamReadFormat to make up the DIB).  This image may be compressed and useless to you until you decompress the image into something you can display using the Image Compression Manager (ICM) described in the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 2: Using the Installable Compression Manager.  The type of compression will be indicated by the LPBI returned by the AVIStreamReadFormat call.  For a video stream, the length parameter lSamples is ignored, and the buffer is only filled with data for a single frame.

For an audio stream, the data returned will be actual wave samples.  These wave samples may also be compressed.  The compression type is indicated in the PCMWAVEFORMAT returned by the AVIStreamReadFormat call.


LPVOID AVIStreamGetFrame(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos)


If you don't want the hassle of reading the format and the data bits for a video stream and then handling the decompression yourself, the above call will do all of this for you.  If the frame of video you are reading depends on data in previous frames to make up its image, this function will also read all the data since the previous key frame up until the frame you specify to build up the entire image for the frame you request.  

AVIStreamGetFrame takes a pointer to a video stream, and a position (frame number) in the file and returns an LPBITMAPINFOHEADER which points to a valid uncompressed DIB that can be displayed using standard Windows calls, or using the DrawDib routines which handle images of different bit depths, and automatic dithering for displays that can't handle certain types of DIBS.  The DrawDib functions are described separately in the Video for Windows Development Kit, chapter 3: Using the DrawDib Functions.

LPVOID AVIStreamReadData(PAVISTREAM pavi, DWORD fcc, LPVOID lp,
					LONG cb)

Not implemented.  To be announced.



Finding Key Frames, Non-empty frames, or Format Changes in a Stream

AVIStreamFindSample(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lPos, LONG lFlags)

This function will start at the position in the file that you specify, and search forwards or backwards (depending on the flags set) for the nearest key frame, non-empty frame, or format change, and return that frame number.

The possible flags for search direction are FIND_PREV and FIND_NEXT.  Both of these flags will return lPos if the sample given qualifies.

The possible flags for search item are FIND_KEY, FIND_ANY, or FIND_FORMAT.


Positioning Within a Stream

LONG AVIStreamStart(PAVISTREAM pavi)

will return the sample (frame) number of the first sample in the stream.  Use this number with the read functions to access the first  sample of data.  (For instance, the frames of a movie may be counted starting at zero or one depending on the preference of the author).  This value can also be found in the AVISTREAMHEADER structure returned by the AVIStreamInfo call.

LONG AVIStreamLength(PAVISTREAM pavi)

will return the number of frames (or samples) in the stream.  This value can also be found in the AVISTREAMHEADER structure returned by the AVIStreamInfo call.

LONG AVIStreamSampleToTime(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lSample)

will take a sample (frame) number of an AVI stream, and return the time, in milliseconds, associated with that sample.  For a video frame, this will be the time, offset from zero for the start of the movie, that this frame will appear when the AVI is played at its proper speed.  For an audio sample number, this will be time that the particular sample will be heard.

LONG AVIStreamTimeToSample(PAVISTREAM pavi, LONG lTime)

is the opposite of AVIStreamSampleToTime.  It is more accurate to deal with the position of a file using its sample number, since the time in milliseconds is only an approximation of when an event is taking place.  These functions are not true inverses, as two consecutive samples of audio may both be heard in the same millisecond, and converting the time value back to a sample number may give a different sample number than the original one.



Helper Macros

There are also a number of macros available that combine the functionality of the above functions to make it easier for you to perform certain common tasks.  These macros are listed below, followed by the code they translate to, along with an explanation.


AVIStreamSampleToSample(pavi1, pavi2, lSample) :=
           AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi1,AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi2, lSample))

Given a sample in the stream pavi2, this will return the sample in pavi1 that occurs at the same time as the given sample.

AVIStreamNextSampleTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t) + 1)

This macro will tell you when the sample occuring at the time you provide will change to the next sample.  Basically, it informs you of the next "interesting" time in the stream.

AVIStreamPrevSampleTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t) - 1)

This macro is similar to AVIStreamNextSampleTime, but looks at the time for the sample that comes BEFORE the time you provide.






AVIStreamNextKeyFrameTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi,
		AVIStreamFindKeyFrame(pavi, AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t), 			SEARCH_FORWARD))

This macro returns the time of the next key frame in the stream, starting at a given time that you provide.

AVIStreamPrevKeyFrameTime(pavi, t) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi,
		AVIStreamFindKeyFrame(pavi,AVIStreamTimeToSample(pavi, t), 			SEARCH_BACKWARD))

This macro returns the time of the most recent key frame that occured before the time that you provide.

AVIStreamStartTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamStart(pavi))

This macro returns the starting time of the stream's first sample.

AVIStreamLengthTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamLength(pavi))

This macro returns the length of the stream in time, not samples.

AVIStreamEnd(pavi) :=
            (AVIStreamStart(pavi) + AVIStreamLength(pavi))

This macro returns the sample number associated with the end of the stream.  This sample number is not a valid sample number to be read, but represents the end of the file.

AVIStreamEndTime(pavi) :=
            AVIStreamSampleToTime(pavi, AVIStreamEnd(pavi))

This macro returns the time representing the end of the stream.

AVIStreamSampleSize(pavi, lPos) :=
	    AVIStreamRead(pavi, lPos, 1, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL)

This macro returns the size of the buffer needed to store one sample of information from this stream (the sample at the position you provide)

.

AVIStreamFormatSize(pavi, lPos) :=

Things to do in AVIFile:

Need handlers for:
	Quicktime files
	Targa files
	JPEG files
	MPEG files

Improve streaming interface

Speed improvements:
	Use GlobalDosAlloc for buffers?
	Read several frames at one time?

Current bugs:
	Error returns are lousy.


More things to do:
	Automatically generate open/save filter strings.  This would 
	require that we put something in the regdb to indicate which 
	handlers supported writing....

	Should there be some way to pass AVIFileOpen an HMMIO?  An
	IStorage or IStream?

	It would be nice to have some way to be notified when the contents
	of a stream change....  Look at IAdviseHolder

	ReadData and WriteData need to be renamed, because they
	confuse everybody.  Also, need better method for accessing
	DISP and LIST `INFO' chunks.

	Stream names need to be better supported.

	During long operations, we need some kind of status callback.

	Should everything have version numbers?

	"capabilities": Additional information via AVIFile/StreamInfo
	about what the handler can do

	Do handlers need parameters somehow?  Some way to configure
	stuff for a particular file format?  Am I deluding myself into
	thinking I can get away without this stuff?

	More thought is needed about "non-seekable" streams.  For
	instance: can a video capture device be thought of as a
	stream? 

	Can making a stream handler be made easier?  One thought: a
	C++ base class for a stream handler which people could
	override only the methods they want....

	How can you change the rectangle for a stream?
	Do we need an AVIStreamSetInfo command?


	Can we make streams be named?  Instead of opening streams by type 
	and number, people could enumerate the streams in a file and open
	them by name....  Looks more and more like IStorage....


	Everything needs to be renamed.  Functions shouldn't all
	start with "AVI".

	We need a new interface to handle change notifications.  Copy
	OLE Advise Holders, Advise Sinks.


	Marshal the AVIFile reader in the following way:
	Right before reading from an HMMIO, check the current task.
	Re-open the file for each new HTASK....

	Some way of getting an error string from an error value would
	be good.


	I don't really use the IEditStream interface for everything.
	I should make Vtbls for the editstrm.c implementation, and allow
	other handlers to support the stuff.

	How can you use ReadData/WriteData to deal with more than one
	chunk with the same ID?  How about INFO chunks?


Old Stuff that's done:

	Does AVIStreamWrite need some way of returning how much of the
	data was actually written?  (Particularly in the case where
	it's doing ACM compression, it may only be able to write out 
	whole blocks of data....)


	EditStreamSetName
	EditStreamClone

	AVIStreamInfo could use a different structure than an
	AVIStreamHeader.  In particular, the structure could lose
	some useless fields and gain the stream name.  Same with
	AVIFileInfo. 

	During long operations, we need some kind of status callback.	


	Look at using IAVIFile, IAVIStream on the clipboard along with
	IDataObject.  This seems to require some work to "marshal"
	the interface from app to app....

	Given an open IAVIFile handle, retrieve its "file format", that
	is, some user-readable name for what kind of file it is....

	It would be nice to be able to write to the compression streams

	The options dialog doesn't make me happy....

Using AVIFile.


Initializing the AVIFile DLL:
Before using any of the APIs in AVIFILE.DLL, be sure to 
call AVIStreamInit.  After using them, call AVIStreamExit.
If you don't, bad things will happen.


Using AVIFile to read some kind of file: 

First, call AVIFileOpen with the OF_READ flag to open the file.
Then, you can call AVIFileInfo to find out how many streams are in
the file, and AVIFileGetStream to retrieve the streams you want.

Once you have a stream, you can can AVIStreamReadFormat to get the
bitmap format or wave format, and then call AVIStreamRead to actually
read the data you want.





AVIFile and the Component Object model:

The AVIFile APIs include two interfaces, IAVIFile and IAVIStream,
which work with the Component Object model which is part of OLE 2.0.

Class IDs
Each server or DLL that handles these interfaces needs to have a
Globally Unique ID (GUID), so that it can be distinguished from all
other handlers.  OLE uses 16-byte identifiers for this purpose.  If
you're making a new handler, you can run the UUIDGEN program to make
yourself a unique ID.

The Registration Database
The registration database is essentially just a replacement for .INI
files.  To look at what's going on in it, run "regedit -v".

DLLs which implement the IAVIFile and IAVIStream interfaces all need
to be listed in the registration database so that they can be found
when necessary.

Each DLL must be listed in the registration database by class ID,
with entries of the form:


HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = Wave File reader/writer
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\InprocServer = wavefile.dll

where HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is the root of the entire registration
database.  The InProcServer entry indicates that wavefile.dll can be
loaded within an application to implement the class in question.

The AVIFile library uses additional entries in the registration
database in order to know which handler to use by default to open a
given file.  If the file is a RIFF file, 

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\Extensions\WAV = {00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\RIFFHandlers\WAVE = {00020003-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

You get a GUID by running the uuidgen.exe program that comes
with the SDK; it will spit out a 16-byte hex number for you.  You then
make a file with a .REG extension that looks like:
REGEDIT
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002} = JFIF (JPEG) Files 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Clsid\{5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002}\InprocServer =jfiffile.dll
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AVIFile\Extensions\JPG = {5C2B8200-E2C8-1068-B1CA-6066188C6002}

(Of course, use your GUID here.)  Then, on a user's machine, they can run
regedit -s whatever.reg and these definitions will get added to the 
registration database, allowing the system to find your DLL and know what
sorts of files it can load.



What are IAVIFile and IAVIStream?
(Note: you may just want to read the OLE 2 documentation here....)

These are examples of "interfaces".  An interface is a collection of 
"methods".





Implementing a handler DLL



IClassFactory
Obviously, it isn't enough for OLE to know the name of your DLL; some
standard entry point is required to establish communications.  The
method through which COMPOBJ.DLL does this isn't exactly
straightforward.  A handler DLL must export a DllGetClassObject
function; COMPOBJ calls that function to ask the DLL to return an
instance of the IClassFactory interface, which it then uses to
actually acquire an instance of the IAVIFile interface that we
actually care about.


Single-stream vs. Multi-stream
AVI files obviously support more than one stream of data in each
file.  Wave files, for example, are much simpler, in that they only
can have exactly one stream of audio.  This means that we only need
one stream object around, and we can make things even simpler by
having the same object support both the stream and file interfaces.

If you know that your handler will support, say, exactly one audio
and one video stream, things are also simpler than the completely
general case, because when you create your file object, you know that 
you will have to create exactly two stream objects.


Read-only vs. Read-write

A handler can be written which only supports reading or writing; you
can always return an error code from any method.  (One suggestion:
don't return unsupported from the FindSample function, but rather
just return that every frame is a key frame, every frame is non-empty, and 
that the only format change is frame 0)


Using C++
These handlers don't actually need to be implemented using C++; it
was just easier that way.


Installing your handler:
For your handler to be found, it needs to have the appropriate
entries in the registration database.
















Compression DLLs
When you call AVIMakeCompressedStream, you pass in a PAVISTREAM and
are returned another PAVISTREAM.  This new stream can be used in two
ways: either you can read from the stream, in which case you will
read data which is compressed from the original stream, or you can
write to the new stream, in which case the data you write will be
compressed and written to the original stream.

To use the "read" method, you would use the following sequence of
calls: (extra parameters left out because I can't remember them at
the moment)
AVIFileOpen(&pf, "foo.avi",...)
AVIFileGetStream(pf, &ps, ...)  
AVIMakeCompressedStream(ps, &psC, &options, ...)
AVIStreamReadFormat(psC, lpFormatC, &cbFormatC) // get compressed format
for (loop through frames)
	AVIStreamRead(psC, frame, ....)  // read compressed frames

To use the "write" method:
AVIFileOpen(&pf, "foo.avi", OF_CREATE | OF_WRITE...)
AVIFileCreateStream(pf, &ps, &strhdr, ....)
AVIMakeCompressedStream(ps, &psU, &options, ...)
AVIStreamSetFormat(psU, lpFormatU, cbFormatU) // set format of data
					// to compress
for (loop through frames)
	AVIStreamWrite(psU, frame, ....)  // write uncompressed frames,
					// which will be compressed and
					// written to the file





Using the Clipboard functions

The clipboard functions are easy.  To copy a bunch of streams to
the clipboard, call AVIMakeFileFromStreams to bundle them up into a
single PAVIFILE, then call AVIPutFileOnClipboard.  To get data off of
the clipboard, call AVIGetFromClipboard.  To see whether any data is
present on the clipboard, for enabling menus or such, you can just
call AVIGetFromClipboard to see if it returns anything, and release
any file it returns.

This document describes how messages will be input, stored and formatted
by a Win32 application.

1.  Message Input

    Messages are input as ASCII text in a text file.  The format of this
    file supports specifying multiple versions of the same message text,
    one for each language supported.  It also supports automatic assignment
    of code numbers to each message, along with the generation of a C
    language include file for use by the application for accessing the
    messages using symbolic constants.  The purpose of the message text
    file is to define all of the messages needed by an application, in a
    format that makes it easy to support multiple languages with the same
    image file.

    Message text files are converted into binary resource files by the
    MC program.  These binary resource files are then input to the RC
    compiler which will put them in the resource table for an
    application or DLL.

    The format of the message text file (default extension is .mc).
    Basic syntax is Keyword=Value, where spaces around the equal sign
    are ignored, and the value is delimited by white space from the next
    keyword=value pair.  Case is ignored when comparing against keyword
    names.  The value portion can either be a numeric integer constant,
    {NUMBER}, using C syntax; a symbol name, {NAME}, that follows the
    rules for C identifier names; or a file name that follows the
    rules for the FAT file system (8 characters or less, no periods).

    Comment lines are allowed in the message text file.  The comment
    syntax is the same as for WIN.INI, namely a semicolon begins a
    comment which is terminated by the end of the line.  Comments that
    exist by themselves on a line are copied as is to the output .h
    file, with the semicolon converted to the C end of line comment
    syntax (//).

    The overall structure of a message text file consists of a header
    section which contains zero or more of the following keywords:

        MessageIdTypedef={NAME}
        SeverityNames=({NAME}={NUMBER}:{NAME})
        FacilityNames=({NAME}={NUMBER}:{NAME})
        LanguageNames=({NAME}={NUMBER}:{FILENAME})

    These keywords have the following meaning:

        MessageIdTypedef - gives a symbolic name that is output as the
            typedef name for each numeric MessageId value.  The default
            value for this is NULL, which means there will be no type
            cast output when defining symbolic names for a MessageId.

        SeverityNames - defines the set of names that are allowed as the
            value of the Severity keyword in the message definition.
            The set is delimited by left and right parenthesis.
            Associated with each severity name is a number that, when
            shifted left by 30, gives the bit pattern to logically OR
            with the Facility value and MessageId to come up with the
            full 32-bit message code.  The default value of this keyword
            is:

                SeverityNames=(Success=0x0
                               Informational=0x1
                               Warning=0x2
                               Error=0x3
                              )

            Severity values occupy the high two bits of a 32-bit message
            code.  Any severity value that does not fit in two bits is
            an error.  The severity codes can be given symbolic names
            by following each value with :{NAME}

        FacilityNames - defines the set of names that are allowed as the
            value of the Facility keyword in the message definition.
            The set is delimited by left and right parenthesis.
            Associated with each facility name is a number that, when
            shift it left by 16 bits, gives the bit pattern to logically
            OR with the Severity value and MessageId to come up with the
            full 32-bit message code.  The default value of this keyword
            is:

                FacilityNames=(System=0x0FF
                               Application=0xFFF
                              )


            Facility codes occupy the low order 12 bits of the high
            order 16-bits of a 32-bit message code.  Any facility code
            that does not fit in 12 bits is an error.  This allows for
            4096 facility codes.  The first 256 are reserved for
            use by the system software.

            The facility codes can be given symbolic names by following
            each value with :{NAME}

        LanguageNames - defines the set of names that are allowed as the
            value of the Language keyword in the message definition.
            The set is delimited by left and right parenthesis.
            Associated with each language name is a number and a file
            name that will be used to name the binary output file that
            will contain all of the message text for that language.  The
            number corresponds to the Language Id tag to use in the
            resource table.  The number is separate from the file name
            with a colon.  The initial value of this keyword is:

                LanguageNames=(English=1:MSG00001)

            Any new names that an application defines in its .mc file
            which don't override any of the builtin names will be added
            to the list of valid languages.  This allows an application
            to support private languages with descriptive names.

    Following the header section are zero or more message definitions.
    Each message definition begins with one or more of the following
    keywords.

        MessageId={|{NUMBER}|+{NUMBER}}
        Severity={SEVERITY_NAME}
        Facility={FACILITY_NAME}
        SymbolicName={NAME}

    The MessageId keyword is required to mark the beginning of the
    message definition, although its value is optional.  If no value is
    specified, then the value used will be the last value used for the
    facility, plus one.  If the value is specified as +{NUMBER} then
    the value used will be the last value used for the facility, plus
    the number after the plus sign.  Otherwise if a numeric value is
    given, that will be value used.  Any MessageId value that does not
    fit in 16 bits is an error.

    Severity and Facility are optional keywords that can specify
    additional bits to OR into the final 32-bit message code.  If either
    of these are not specified they default to the value last specified
    for a message definition.  The initial values of these prior to
    processing the first message definition is:

        Severity=Success
        Facility=Application

    The value associated with these keywords must match one of the names
    given to the FacilityNames and SeverityNames keywords.  The SymbolicName
    keyword allows the ISV to associate a C symbolic constant name with the
    final 32-bit message code that is a result of ORing together the
    MessageId, Severity and Facility bits.  The constant definition is
    output to the generated .h file with the following format:

        //
        // {MESSAGETEXT}
        //

        #define CONSTANT_SYMBOL_NAME ((MessageIdTypedef) 0x12345678)

    where the comment before the definition is a copy of the message
    text for the first language specified in the message definition.
    The CONSTANT_SYMBOL_NAME is the value of the SymbolicName keyword.
    The MessageIdTypedef is not output if it is NULL, the default value.

    After the message definition keywords, comes one or more message text
    definitions.  Each message text definition begins with the Language
    keyword that identifies which binary output file this message text
    is to be output to.  Beginning on the very next line is the first
    line of the message text.  The message text is terminated by a line
    containing a single period at the beginning of the line, immediately
    followed by a new line.  No spaces allowed around keyword.  Within
    the message text, blank lines and white space are preserved as part
    of the message.

        Language={LANGUAGE_NAME}
        {MESSAGETEXT}
        .

    Within the message text, several escape sequences are supported for
    dynamically formatting the message.  The percent sign character (%)
    begins all escape sequences.


        %0 - This terminates a message text line without a trailing
             newline.  This can be used to build up long lines or to
             terminate the message itself without a trailing newline,
             which is useful for prompt messages.

        %n!printf format string!  - This identifies an insert.  The
             value of n can be between 1 and 99.  The printf format
             string must be bracketed by exclamation marks.  It is
             optional and defaults to !s! if not specified.

             The printf format string can contain the * specifier for
             either the precision or width components, and if so, they
             will consume inserts %n+1 and %n+2 for their values at run
             time.  MC will print a warning message if an explicit
             reference is made to these inserts elsewhere in the message
             text.

    Inserts must reference a parameter passed to the FormatMessage API
    call.  It will return an error if a message refers to an insert that
    was not passed to the FormatMessage API call.

    Any other character following a percent sign, other than a digit will
    be formatted in the output message without the percent sign.  Some
    examples:

        %% - will output a single percent sign in the formatted message text.

        %n - will output a hard line break when it occurs at the end of a
             a line.  Useful when FormatMessage is supplying normal line
             breaks so the message fits in a certain width.

        %r - will output a hard carriage return, without a trailing newline.

        %b - will output a space in the formatted message text.  This
             can be used to insure there are the appropriate number of
             trailing spaces in a message text line.

        %t - will output a tab in the formatted message text.

        %. - will output a single period in the formatted message text.
             This can be used to get a single period at the beginning of
             a line without terminating the message text definition.

        %! - will output a single exclamation point in the formatted
             message text.  This can be used to get an exclamation point
             immediately after an insert without it being mistaken for
             the beginning of a printf format string.

    Unicode support is not understood yet.  If the input file is ASCII
    text, do we need an escape sequence to allow input of Unicode values?
    Or do we just let them use DBCS in the text file, assuming they have
    a text editor that can do this.

2.  Message Compiler (MC)

    This program converts .mc message text files into binary files
    suitable for inclusion into a .RC file by the resource compiler.

    Command line syntax:

        MC [-v] [-w] [-s] [-h DirSpec] [-r DirSpec] filename[.mc] ...

    where:

        -v - generates verbose output to stderr.

        -w - generates a warning message whenever an insert escape
             sequence is seen that is a superset of the type supported
             by OS/2 mkmsgf (i.e.  anything other than %0 and %n).
             Useful for converting old OS/2 message files to this
             format.

        -s - Add an extra line to the beginning of each message that is
             the symbolic name associated with the message id.

        -h DirSpec - specifies the target directory of the generated
             .h file.  The file name is the name of the .mc file with a
             .h extension.

        -r DirSpec - specifies the target directory of the generated
             .rc file.  The file name is the name of the .mc file with a
             .rc extension.

        filename.mc - specifes one or more input message files that
                      will be compiled into one or more binary resource
                      files, one for each language that the message
                      files contain message text for.

    The message compiler reads the .mc file and generates a .h file
    containing all the symbolic name definitions.  For each LanguageId
    that was used to specify message text, it outputs a binary file
    containing a message table resource.  It also outputs a single .rc
    file that contains the appropriate RC syntax to include each binary
    file output as a resource with the appropriate name and type ids.

3.  Message Win32 API Calls

DWORD
APIENTRY
FormatMessage(
    DWORD dwFlags,
    LPVOID lpSource,
    DWORD dwMessageId,
    DWORD dwLanguageId,
    LPSTR lpBuffer,
    DWORD nSize,
    va_list Arguments
    )

Routine Description:

    This function formats a message string.  Input to this function is a
    message definition.  It can come from a buffer passed into this
    function.  It can come from a message table resource in a module
    already loaded.  Or the caller can ask this function to search the
    system message table resource(s) for the message.  This function
    finds the message definition based on the Message Id and the
    Language Id and copies the message text to the output buffer,
    processing any imbedded insert sequences if requested.

Arguments:

    dwFlags - Specifies options to the formatting process along with how
        to interpret the lpSource parameter.  The low order 16bits of
        this parameter are the maximum width of a line, in characters.
        Possible values are:

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER - the lpBuffer is a PVOID * and
            nSize is the minimum size to allocate.  This function will
            then allocate a buffer large enought to hold the formatted
            message and store the pointer to the buffer in the location
            pointed to by lpBuffer.   Caller should free the buffer
            with LocalFree when they are done using it.

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS - insert sequences in the message
            definition will be ignored and passed through to the output
            buffer as is.  Useful for fetching a message for later
            formatting.  If this flag is set, the lpArguments parameter
            is ignored.

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING - lpSource is a pointer to a null
            terminated message definition.  It can contain insert
            sequences just as the message text in the .mc file can.

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE - lpSource is a module handle that
            contains the message table resource(s) to search.  If this
            handle is NULL, then the current process's application
            image file will be searched.

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM - If the requested message was not
            found in lpSource or if lpSource was not examined (i.e. neither
            of the preceeding two flags was specified), then this function
            will search the system message table resource(s).

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_ARGUMENT_ARRAY - If set, specifies that the passed
            Arguments parameter is NOT a va_list structure but instead is
            just a pointer to an array of 32-bit values that represent
            the arguments.

        FORMAT_MESSAGE_MAX_WIDTH_MASK - The low order 8 bits specify the
            maximum width of each line formatted into the output buffer.
            A maximum width of zero, means that no restrictions are
            placed on the width, and only the line breaks in the message
            definition will be placed in the output buffer.  If a non-zero
            value is specified, then line breaks in the message definition
            text are ignored, and instead line breaks are calculated based
            on the maximum width, with white space delimited strings never
            being split across a line break.  Hard coded line breaks in
            the message definition text, that are identified by the %n
            escape sequence, are always output to the output buffer.

            If the width specified is FORMAT_MESSAGE_MAX_WIDTH_MASK, then
            line breaks in the message file are ignored and only hard coded
            line breaks are kept and none are generated.

    lpSource - specifies where to retrieve the message definition from.
        The type of this parameter depends upon the settings in the
        dwFlags parameter.

            FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE - lpSource is an hModule of the
                module that contains the message table to search.

            FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING - lpSource is an LPSTR that points
                to unformatted message text.  It will be scanned for
                inserts and formatted accordingly.

        If neither of these options is specified, then this parameter is
        ignored.

    dwMessageId - specifices the 32-bit message identifier that identifies
        the message being requested.  This parameter is ignored if the
        FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING flag is specified.

    dwLanguageId - specifices the 32-bit language identifier that
        identifies the language of the message being requested.  This
        parameter is ignored if the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING flag is
        specified.

    lpBuffer - specifies a pointer to a buffer where the formatted message
        is to be written.  A terminating null byte will also be written.
        If the FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER flag was specified, then
        this parameter points to a 32-bit pointer value that is filled in
        by this call with a pointer allocated via LocalAlloc to contain
        the text of the message.

    nSize - specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be stored in
        the output buffer.  This parameter is ignore if the
        FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER flag is set.

    Arguments - specifies a pointer to variable number of arguments.
        These arguments are used to satisfy insert requests in the
        format string.  Thus %1 in the format string specifies the
        first argument in the variable number of arguments described
        by the Arguments parameter; %3 would specify the third, etc.

        The interpretation of each 32-bit arguments value depends upon
        the formatting information associated with the insert in the
        message definition.  The default is to treat each pointer as a
        pointer to a null terminated string.

        By default the Arguments parameter is of type va_list, which is
        a language and implementation specific data type for describing
        a variable number of arguments.  If you do not have a pointer of
        type va_list, then specify the FORMAT_MESSAGE_ARGUMENT_ARRAY
        flag and pass a pointer to an array of 32-bit values that are
        are input to the message formatted as the insert values.
Return Value:

    DwORD - Returns the number of bytes actually stored in the output
        buffer, excluding the terminating null character.  Returns 0 if
        an error occurred.  Extended error status is available via the
        GetLastError API.

DOC file for AVI Installable compressors
ToddLa
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document covers what happens (from the drivers point of
view) when AVI loads, saves, edits, and plays a AVI file.


FORMAT OF A AVI FILE -------------------------------------------------------

AVI files are RIFF files with the following structure:

    RIFF('AVI'
        LIST('hdrl'
            avih(<MainAVIHeader>)
            LIST ('strl'
                strh(<Stream header>)
                strf(<Stream format>)
                strd(<Stream data>)
            )
        )
        LIST('movi'
	    00??(<driver Data>)
            .
            .
            .
	    00??(<driver Data>)
        )
        indx(<AVIIndex>)
    )

OPENING a file for decompression -------------------------------------------

this is what the driver see's when a AVI file is opened for playback
or editing.


    1.	The AVI runtime driver gets the FOURCC driver name from the stream
	header and tries to open the named driver.  drivers are
	listed in SYSTEM.INI

	    [Installable Compressors]
		VIDC.SAMP = icsample.drv

	This example lists a video driver ('VIDC') with the name 'SAMP'.

	The first message a device driver receives is DRV_OPEN. Your 
        device driver should allocate any instance data it uses when 
        it processes this message. (Your driver will receive DRV_OPEN 
        each time it is opened.)

    2.	If a 'strd' chunk exists for this stream, the AVI runtime driver 
        will send your driver an ICM_SETSTATE message. The <MI>lParam1<D> 
        parameter will contain a pointer to the data from 
	the file.

    3.	Depending on how the AVI runtime driver will use the decompressed 
        data, it will send either ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT
	or ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY to determine the decompression format.

	ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT:

	    When your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT, 
	    <MI>lParam1<D> points to the 'strf' data, and <MI>lParam2<D> 
            points to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure.

	    Your driver should fill in the <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> with 
            information about the format it will use for decompressing 
            the data.

	    If your device driver cannot handle the input format, or 
            the input format 'strf' is incorrect, your driver 
            should return ICMERR_BADFORMAT to fail the message.

	ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY:

	    When your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY, 
	    <MI>lParam1<D> points to the 'strf' data, and <MI>lParam2<D> 
            points to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure. For this message, 
            the AVI runtime driver filled the structure with a 
            description of the output format it wants to use.

	    The sugested format will be the native or best format
	    for the decompressed data.  For example, 
            if playback is on an  8-bit device, the AVI runtime driver 
            will suggest an 8-bit DIB.

	    Your driver does not have to accept the suggested format. 
            If you fail the message, the AVI runtime driver will 
            suggest alternate formats until your driver accepts one. 
            If your driver exhausts the list of formats normally used, 
            the AVI runtime driver will request a format with 
            ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT.

    4.	When the AVI runtime driver is ready, it sends the 
        ICM_DECOMPRESS_BEGIN message to the device driver. The AVI runtime 
        driver sets <MI>lParam1<D> to the input format ('strf' data) 
        and <MI>lParam2<D> to the decompressed format of the DIB.
	If either of the formats is incorrect, your device driver 
        should return ICERR_BADFORMAT.

    5.	The AVI runtime driver sends ICM_DECOMPRESS each time 
        it has an image to decompress. The <B>ICDECOMPRESS<D> 
        structure specified in <MI>lParam1<D> contains the 
        decompression parameters. The AVI runtime driver 
        uses the flags in the AVI index to ensure decompression 
        will start on key frame boundries, 

    6.	Your device driver receives ICM_DECOMPRESS_END when 
        the AVI runtime driver no longer needs data decompressed.
        When the device driver is no longer needed the system will 
        close it by sending DRV_CLOSE.


COMPRESSING a file ------------------------------------------------------

This is the sequence of messages that occur for compressing video data.

NOTE: When an AVI file is recompressed, each frame is decompressed to 
a full frame and passed to the decompressor.


    1.  The first message a device driver receives is DRV_OPEN. Your 
        device driver should allocate any instance data it uses when 
        it processes this message. (Your driver will receive DRV_OPEN 
        each time it is opened.)


    2.	The AVI runtime driver restores the device driver state 
        by sending ICM_SET_STATE. (The state is recalled from the 
        strd data chunk of the AVI file. The state information was 
        obtained with the ICM_GET_STATE message.)

    3.	The AVI runtime driver determines the size of the buffer needed to 
        hold the compressed data format by sending ICM_COMPRESS_GET_FORMAT. 
        When requesting the buffer size, the AVI runtime driver uses 
        <MI>lParam1<D> to point to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure 
        and sets <MI>lParam2<D> to NULL. Your device driver should 
        return the size of the buffer in bytes.

    4.	The AVI runtime driver requests the output format by sending 
        ICM_COMPRESS_GET_FORMAT with valid pointers in 
        both <MI>lParam1<D> and <MI>lParam2<D>. For this case, 
        your device driver should return the output format in 
        the buffer pointed to by <MI>lParam2<D>. 

	This data becomes the <B>strf<D> chunk in the AVI file.
	The data must start out like a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> data 
        structure. A color table (if used) follows this information. 
	The last part of the data is any additional information 
	required to decompress the file.

    5.	When the AVI runtime driver is ready to start compressing data 
        it sends the ICM_COMPRESS_BEGIN message. 
        The AVI runtime driver uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point to the 
        format of the data being compressed, and uses <MI>lParam2<D> 
        to point to format for the compressed data. If your device 
        driver cannot handle the formats, or if they are incorrect, 
        your driver should return ICERR_BADFORMAT to fail the message.

    6.	Before the AVI runtime driver starts compressing data, it sends 
        ICM_COMPRESS_GET_SIZE. For this message the AVI runtime driver 
        uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point to the input format and uses 
        <MI>lParam2<D> to point to the output format.

	Your driver should return the worst case size (in bytes) that any
	frame can compress to.  The AVI runtime driver uses this size 
        value when it allocates buffers for the compression.

    7.	The AVI runtime driver sends ICM_COMPRESS for each frame it 
        wants compressed. It uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point 
        to an <B>ICCOMPRESS<D> structure containing the parameters 
        used for compression.

	Your driver uses the buffers pointed to by the fields of 
        <B>ICCOMPRESS<D> for returning information 
        about the compressed data. 

        Your driver returns the actual size of the compressed data in the
	<B>biSizeImage<D> field in the <B>BITMAPINFO<D> data structure 
        pointed to by the <B>lpbiOutput<D> field of <B>ICCOMPRESS<D>.

        Your driver returns the chunk ID 
        in the buffer specified in the <B>lpckid<D> that it 
        assigns to the data.

	Your driver also returns a DWORD of flags in the buffer pointed 
        to by <B>lpdwFlags<D>. The flags will be placed	in the AVI 
        index for this chunk. The following flags are defined:

	    AVIIF_TWOCC 	Specifies ckid is a TWOCC.

	    AVIIF_KEYFRAME	Specifies this frame is a key frame.

	Your driver can define its own flags but they must be set in the high
	word only.

	If your driver handles temporal compression (that is, the compression 
        is based on the difference between two frames), it needs to save the
	previous frame(s) for temporal compresssion.

    8.	Your device driver receives ICM_DECOMPRESS_END when 
        the AVI runtime driver no longer needs data compressed, or when 
        the AVI runtime driver is changing the format or palette.
        If the AVI runtime driver will continue compressing data, it 
        will start the sequence by sending ICM_COMPRESS_BEGIN.
        When the device driver is no longer needed the system will 
        close it by sending DRV_CLOSE.


      The driver might also receive a ICM_COMPRESS_QUERY message 
      to determine if it supports the input or output format.

DOC file for AVI Installable compressors
ToddLa
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document covers what happens (from the drivers point of
view) when AVI loads, saves, edits, and plays a AVI file.


FORMAT OF A AVI FILE -------------------------------------------------------

AVI files are RIFF files with the following structure:

    RIFF('AVI'
        LIST('hdrl'
            avih(<MainAVIHeader>)
            LIST ('strl'
                strh(<Stream header>)
                strf(<Stream format>)
                strd(<Stream data>)
            )
        )
        LIST('movi'
	    00??(<driver Data>)
            .
            .
            .
	    00??(<driver Data>)
        )
        indx(<AVIIndex>)
    )

OPENING a file for decompression -------------------------------------------

this is what the driver see's when a AVI file is opened for playback
or editing.


    1.	The AVI runtime driver gets the FOURCC driver name from the stream
	header and tries to open the named driver.  drivers are
	listed in SYSTEM.INI

	    [Installable Compressors]
		VIDC.SAMP = icsample.drv

	This example lists a video driver ('VIDC') with the name 'SAMP'.

	The first message a device driver receives is DRV_OPEN. Your 
        device driver should allocate any instance data it uses when 
        it processes this message. (Your driver will receive DRV_OPEN 
        each time it is opened.)

    2.	If a 'strd' chunk exists for this stream, the AVI runtime driver 
        will send your driver an ICM_SETSTATE message. The <MI>lParam1<D> 
        parameter will contain a pointer to the data from 
	the file.

    3.	Depending on how the AVI runtime driver will use the decompressed 
        data, it will send either ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT
	or ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY to determine the decompression format.

	ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT:

	    When your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT, 
	    <MI>lParam1<D> points to the 'strf' data, and <MI>lParam2<D> 
            points to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure.

	    Your driver should fill in the <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> with 
            information about the format it will use for decompressing 
            the data.

	    If your device driver cannot handle the input format, or 
            the input format 'strf' is incorrect, your driver 
            should return ICMERR_BADFORMAT to fail the message.

	ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY:

	    When your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY, 
	    <MI>lParam1<D> points to the 'strf' data, and <MI>lParam2<D> 
            points to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure. For this message, 
            the AVI runtime driver filled the structure with a 
            description of the output format it wants to use.

	    The sugested format will be the native or best format
	    for the decompressed data.  For example, 
            if playback is on an  8-bit device, the AVI runtime driver 
            will suggest an 8-bit DIB.

	    Your driver does not have to accept the suggested format. 
            If you fail the message, the AVI runtime driver will 
            suggest alternate formats until your driver accepts one. 
            If your driver exhausts the list of formats normally used, 
            the AVI runtime driver will request a format with 
            ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT.

    4.	When the AVI runtime driver is ready, it sends the 
        ICM_DECOMPRESS_BEGIN message to the device driver. The AVI runtime 
        driver sets <MI>lParam1<D> to the input format ('strf' data) 
        and <MI>lParam2<D> to the decompressed format of the DIB.
	If either of the formats is incorrect, your device driver 
        should return ICERR_BADFORMAT.

    5.	The AVI runtime driver sends ICM_DECOMPRESS each time 
        it has an image to decompress. The <B>ICDECOMPRESS<D> 
        structure specified in <MI>lParam1<D> contains the 
        decompression parameters. The AVI runtime driver 
        uses the flags in the AVI index to ensure decompression 
        will start on key frame boundries, 

    6.	Your device driver receives ICM_DECOMPRESS_END when 
        the AVI runtime driver no longer needs data decompressed.
        When the device driver is no longer needed the system will 
        close it by sending DRV_CLOSE.


COMPRESSING a file ------------------------------------------------------

This is the sequence of messages that occur for compressing video data.

NOTE: When an AVI file is recompressed, each frame is decompressed to 
a full frame and passed to the decompressor.


    1.  The first message a device driver receives is DRV_OPEN. Your 
        device driver should allocate any instance data it uses when 
        it processes this message. (Your driver will receive DRV_OPEN 
        each time it is opened.)


    2.	The AVI runtime driver restores the device driver state 
        by sending ICM_SET_STATE. (The state is recalled from the 
        strd data chunk of the AVI file. The state information was 
        obtained with the ICM_GET_STATE message.)

    3.	The AVI runtime driver determines the size of the buffer needed to 
        hold the compressed data format by sending ICM_COMPRESS_GET_FORMAT. 
        When requesting the buffer size, the AVI runtime driver uses 
        <MI>lParam1<D> to point to a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> structure 
        and sets <MI>lParam2<D> to NULL. Your device driver should 
        return the size of the buffer in bytes.

    4.	The AVI runtime driver requests the output format by sending 
        ICM_COMPRESS_GET_FORMAT with valid pointers in 
        both <MI>lParam1<D> and <MI>lParam2<D>. For this case, 
        your device driver should return the output format in 
        the buffer pointed to by <MI>lParam2<D>. 

	This data becomes the <B>strf<D> chunk in the AVI file.
	The data must start out like a <B>BITMAPINFOHEADER<D> data 
        structure. A color table (if used) follows this information. 
	The last part of the data is any additional information 
	required to decompress the file.

    5.	When the AVI runtime driver is ready to start compressing data 
        it sends the ICM_COMPRESS_BEGIN message. 
        The AVI runtime driver uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point to the 
        format of the data being compressed, and uses <MI>lParam2<D> 
        to point to format for the compressed data. If your device 
        driver cannot handle the formats, or if they are incorrect, 
        your driver should return ICERR_BADFORMAT to fail the message.

    6.	Before the AVI runtime driver starts compressing data, it sends 
        ICM_COMPRESS_GET_SIZE. For this message the AVI runtime driver 
        uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point to the input format and uses 
        <MI>lParam2<D> to point to the output format.

	Your driver should return the worst case size (in bytes) that any
	frame can compress to.  The AVI runtime driver uses this size 
        value when it allocates buffers for the compression.

    7.	The AVI runtime driver sends ICM_COMPRESS for each frame it 
        wants compressed. It uses <MI>lParam1<D> to point 
        to an <B>ICCOMPRESS<D> structure containing the parameters 
        used for compression.

	Your driver uses the buffers pointed to by the fields of 
        <B>ICCOMPRESS<D> for returning information 
        about the compressed data. 

        Your driver returns the actual size of the compressed data in the
	<B>biSizeImage<D> field in the <B>BITMAPINFO<D> data structure 
        pointed to by the <B>lpbiOutput<D> field of <B>ICCOMPRESS<D>.

        Your driver returns the chunk ID 
        in the buffer specified in the <B>lpckid<D> that it 
        assigns to the data.

	Your driver also returns a DWORD of flags in the buffer pointed 
        to by <B>lpdwFlags<D>. The flags will be placed	in the AVI 
        index for this chunk. The following flags are defined:

	    AVIIF_TWOCC 	Specifies ckid is a TWOCC.

	    AVIIF_KEYFRAME	Specifies this frame is a key frame.

	Your driver can define its own flags but they must be set in the high
	word only.

	If your driver handles temporal compression (that is, the compression 
        is based on the difference between two frames), it needs to save the
	previous frame(s) for temporal compresssion.

    8.	Your device driver receives ICM_DECOMPRESS_END when 
        the AVI runtime driver no longer needs data compressed, or when 
        the AVI runtime driver is changing the format or palette.
        If the AVI runtime driver will continue compressing data, it 
        will start the sequence by sending ICM_COMPRESS_BEGIN.
        When the device driver is no longer needed the system will 
        close it by sending DRV_CLOSE.


      The driver might also receive a ICM_COMPRESS_QUERY message 
      to determine if it supports the input or output format.

CHANGES TO MCIAVI FOR 1.X:

    "other" streams are handled correctly, rectangle's will be
    mapped correctly and draw handlers will be called.

    draw handlers:

        DIB draw handler, there can now be a draw device for uncomressed
        frames, for example hardware can stretch frames, but does not
        need to decomptress.

        the full screen draw handler (DIB draw handler...) can be replaced.

        custom draw handlers can be installed per stream. (a app can
        override the default).  This is done with a new MCI command
        to set the draw procedure.

    formats:

        32 bit DIBs are supported, a decompressor can decompress to
        a 32 bit DIB if wants to.

    decompression to special DIB formats:

        upside down DIB

        MCIAVI will ask the decompressor in decompress to a "upside down"
        DIB.  a "upside down" is a DIB with the scans stored in memory
        top scan to bottom scan, (normal DIBs are stored bottom to top)

        a "upside down" DIB will have a negative biHeight, the height
        of the DIB is abs(biHeight).  the bits pointer passed points
        to the top scan, ie the first one.

        special DIB formats:

        to handle decompression to internal bitmaps in memory, a "new"
        DIB format is used, when biCompression == 'BITM' the DIB memory
        is in HUGE BITMAP format:

            biCompression       'BITM'
            biHeight            will be <0 for a top to bottom bitmap.
            biXPelsPerMeter     will be the width bytes of the bitmap.
            biYPelsPerMeter     will be the fill bytes of the bitmap.


    key frame info:

    a new structure is passed to ICM_DECOMPRESS:

        struct {
            DWORD               dwFlags;    // flags (from AVI index...)
            LPBITMAPINFOHEADER  lpbiInput;  // BITMAPINFO of compressed data
            LPVOID              lpInput;    // compressed data
            LPBITMAPINFOHEADER  lpbiOutput; // DIB to decompress to
            LPVOID              lpOutput;
            DWORD               ckid;       // ckid from AVI file
            int                 iFrame;     // frame info.
            int                 iNextKey;
            int                 iPrevKey;
        }   ICDECOMPRESSX;

    NOTE before using any of the extra info in this structure the
    deompressor should check the size field.

    example:

    case ICM_DECOMPRESS:

        //
        // make sure we have a ICDECOMPRESSX structure
        //
        if ((DWORD)lParam2 >= sizeof(ICDEOMPRESSX))
            return DecompressX(pi,
                 (ICDECOMPRESSX FAR *)lParam1, (DWORD)lParam2);
        else
            return Decompress(pi,
                 (ICDECOMPRESS FAR *)lParam1, (DWORD)lParam2);

    NEW MESSAGE ICM_SET

        #define ICM_SET (ICM_RESERVED+40)
        #define ICM_FRAMERATE       mmioFOURCC('F','r','m','R')
        #define ICM_KEYFRAMERATE    mmioFOURCC('K','e','y','R')

        before playing starts two params get sent down to the decompressor:

            ICM_SET
                lParam1 = 'FrmR'                    (set the frame rate)
                lParam2 = microseconds per frame

            ICM_SET
                lParam1 = 'KeyR'                    (set the key frame "rate")
                lParam2 = average key frame rate    (ie key frame every 15)

        NOTE the key frame rate is a average.


TO DO:
    named streams.
    multiple video streams.
    linked streams (data in another file...)

        DIB draw handler, there can now be a draw device for uncomressed
        frames, for example hardware can stretch frames, but does not
        need to decomptress.

        the full screen draw handler (DIB draw handler...) can be replaced.

        custom draw handlers can be installed per stream. (a app can
        override the default).  This is done with a new MCI command
        to set the draw procedure.

    formats:

        32 bit DIBs are supported, a decompressor can decompress to
        a 32 bit DIB if wants to.

    decompression to special DIB formats:

        upside down DIB

        MCIAVI will ask the decompressor in decompress to a "upside down"
        DIB.  a "upside down" is a DIB with the scans stored in memory
        top scan to bottom scan, (normal DIBs are stored bottom to top)

        a "upside down" DIB will have a negative biHeight, the height
        of the DIB is abs(biHeight).  the bits pointer passed points
        to the top scan, ie the first one.

        special DIB formats:

        to handle decompression to internal bitmaps in memory, a "new"
        DIB format is used, when biCompression == 'BITM' the DIB memory
        is in HUGE BITMAP format:

            biCompression       'BITM'
            biHeight            will be <0 for a top to bottom bitmap.
            biXPelsPerMeter     will be the width bytes of the bitmap.
            biYPelsPerMeter     will be the fill bytes of the bitmap.


    key frame info:

    a new structure is passed to ICM_DECOMPRESS:

        struct {
            DWORD               dwFlags;    // flags (from AVI index...)
            LPBITMAPINFOHEADER  lpbiInput;  // BITMAPINFO of compressed data
            LPVOID              lpInput;    // compressed data
            LPBITMAPINFOHEADER  lpbiOutput; // DIB to decompress to
            LPVOID              lpOutput;
            DWORD               ckid;       // ckid from AVI file
            int                 iFrame;     // frame info.
            int                 iNextKey;
            int                 iPrevKey;
        }   ICDECOMPRESSX;

    NOTE before using any of the extra info in this structure the
    deompressor should check the size field.

    example:

    case ICM_DECOMPRESS:

        //
        // make sure we have a ICDECOMPRESSX structure
        //
        if ((DWORD)lParam2 >= sizeof(ICDEOMPRESSX))
            return DecompressX(pi,
                 (ICDECOMPRESSX FAR *)lParam1, (DWORD)lParam2);
        else
            return Decompress(pi,
                 (ICDECOMPRESS FAR *)lParam1, (DWORD)lParam2);

    NEW MESSAGE ICM_SET

        #define ICM_SET (ICM_RESERVED+40)
        #define ICM_FRAMERATE       mmioFOURCC('F','r','m','R')
        #define ICM_KEYFRAMERATE    mmioFOURCC('K','e','y','R')

        before playing starts two params get sent down to the decompressor:

            ICM_SET
                lParam1 = 'FrmR'                    (set the frame rate)
                lParam2 = microseconds per frame

            ICM_SET
                lParam1 = 'KeyR'                    (set the key frame "rate")
                lParam2 = average key frame rate    (ie key frame every 15)

        NOTE the key frame rate is a average.


TO DO:
    named streams.
    multiple video streams.
    linked streams (data in another file...)

AVI and Palettes
----------------


This is an overview of AVI's use of palettes: there are some small
complexities beyond this that are not generally significant.


Palette Sources
---------------

When playing on a palettised display, AVI must use a palette for
drawing the frames. It gets these palettes from one of these places:

	- from the AVI file header. Attached to the DIB header at the
start of an 8-bit file will be a colour table (an array of 4-byte
RGBQUAD values). The frame DIBs  will consist of indices into this
table. In addition, new palettes can appear throughout the movie
to be used for frames from that point onwards.

	- from the dither proc. If the movie is a higher colour
resolution, drawdib will dither it to the display colour resolution.
In the case of 8-bit displays, 16 and 24-bit videos will be dithered
to a standard 256-colour palette created  in drawdib\dith775.c which
has 7 levels of red and green and 5 levels of blue.

	- from the codec. If the video is a higher colour resolution
and being decompressed to 8-bit palettised, the codec will supply the
palette. for example, the Video 1 codec will decompress 16-bit CRAM
videos directly to 8-bit pal using the standard 7-7-5 palette (same
as the dither code's palette).

	- 4-bit displays will always use the 16-colour VGA palette.

In all of the cases, once we have a frame fully decompressed/dithered
and ready to draw, it is a DIB that consists of a series of indices
into one of these palettes.  We may also have:

	- A client palette: a palette handle can be sent us from the
client. This represents the palette used by the window we are playing
in. We need to draw using this palette to avoid redraws of the
surrounding window when playing in place. In this case we need to
deal with two palettes: the palette containing the colours actually
used in the DIBs (from the avi file or supplied by dither/codec), and
the palette we need to draw with, supplied by the client.

Using The Palette
-----------------

	We draw the frame using SetDIBitsToDevice (or possibly
StretchDIBits). This will interpret the DIB bits in one of two ways
depending on the fuColorUse flag (in fact there are more than two,
but we only use these)

DIB_PAL_INDICES:	this means that the bytes in the DIB are
indices directly into the system palette.

DIB_PAL_COLORS	the bytes in the DIB are indices into a colour table
supplied as the bmiColors field of the bitmapinfoheader supplied.
This colour table must contain indices into the logical palette
selected into the DC (the header including colour table, and the DC
are supplied as arguments).

The DIB_PAL_COLORS case is slower since GDI has to translate the DIB
bytes once using the bmiColors table, and then once again from the
logical palette of the DC to the system palette. However, since we
can't realistically change the DIB data, we can only use
DIB_PAL_INDICES if the system palette is the same as our palette,
which depends on the RealizePalette behaviour:


Realizing Palettes:
-------------------

Before drawing the DIB, we select the palette we want to draw with
into the DC and then call RealizePalette. This has one of two
behaviours:

- if we are the foreground app, RealizePalette assigns entries in the
system palette to contain the colours in our logical palette. The
system keeps some entries in the palette with standard colours in
(the first 10 and last 10 entries) - these are the 'static' colours;
it will allow us to use the remaining entries.

- if not, RealizePalette creates a mapping between our logical
palette and the nearest colours in the current system palette.

When a foreground app realizes a palette, it changes entries in the
system palette, and all other apps need to re-Realize their palettes
in order to get a mapping to the new system palette (unless they are
only using the default, static colours). Thus when we start playing a
video, all other palette-aware apps change colours (when the system
palette changes) and then redraw with the mapping to the new system
palette.


Support for DIB_PAL_INDICES.
---------------------------

Using DIB_PAL_INDICES is only possible if the system palette not only
contains all our colours, but in exactly the same order. To ensure
that this is possible, AVI palettes are generally created containing
the static colours as the first and last 10 colours, and
movie-specific colours in between. Thus when we are foreground and
realize the palette, the system palette will end up exactly the same
as the movie palette, and we can use DIB_PAL_INDICES with its
significant performance benefits.

Whenever the system palette changes, we compare all the colours in
the system palette with the colours in our DIBs. If the two colour
tables are the same, we know it is safe to use DIB_PAL_INDICES. If
not, then we use DIB_PAL_COLORS with a colour table. This colour
table maps the contents of the DIB to the logical palette: this is a
no-op, since the logical palette for our dc is the same as the DIB
palette. The real translation is being done between the logical
palette and the current system palette, and this is set up by GDI
when we issue a 'realizepalette' call.

Support for client Palettes
---------------------------

We are sometimes given a client palette to use (mplayer does this if
playing in place, in an app that is using a non-default palette). The
reason for this is to avoid the flash and re-draw of the client app
that would be necessary if we realized our palette and changed the
system palette. In this case, we select the client palette as our dc
palette, and we build a colour table that maps entries in our palette
to the nearest entry in the client palette. When we then draw - using
DIB_PAL_COLORS - GDI will use this colour table to translate between
the DIB palette and the DC's logical palette ( which is the client
app's palette), and then will translate between the logical palette
and the system palette (probably the same).

NOTE:  MCIWnd is an unsupported API for the Video for Windows 1.0 Developer's Kit and is included as a sample only.   Your application is free to use mciwnd.lib and the APIs for mciwnd but you do so at your own risk and PSS will not answer questions about this component if you ask.







Using MCIWND to Make Developing MCI Applications Easier

Overview

Using the MCI interface to allow your application to play MCI device files can sometimes be confusing and complicated, especially with all of the different commands that a device might support.  Also, there is no user interface built in to MCI to let the user control the playback of files - an application must provide its own scrollbar and buttons for the user to play, pause, rewind, or seek through a file, or not provide this service at all.

MCIWND is a library that your application can link to that will create a new class of window.  Your application needs only to create a window of this class, and then send it a message to open an MCI file.  It can then send other messages to control the playback of the file, or give the user this control with the built in toolbar, scrollbar and menus.

MCIPLAY.C is sample code of an Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application that uses this window class to allow the playback and control of multiple MCI devices/files. 

Services of the MCIWND window class

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	A Toolbar with a PLAY, STOP, RECORD and MENU buttons (when applicable). NOTE:  Holding shift down while pressing the PLAY button will play the media backwards (if supported) and holding control down will play the device in FULLSCREEN mode (for windowed devices).

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	A Trackbar (scrollbar) to allow seeking within a file.  For devices that support tracks (for instance, a CD player) you will see tic marks on the playbar showing you where each track begins, and the page up and page down keys will take you from track to track (for your convenience).


SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	A Pop-Up Track Menu with some common commands when the right mouse button is clicked over the window


SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Simple single-command macros for many of the common MCI commands which eliminates the need for longer, multi-line mciSendCommand or mciSendString calls.

Using MCIWND

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Include the file MCIWND.H in your application's source files to give you access to function prototypes and Macros and defines you will need.

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Link your application with MCIWND.LIB to get the new functionality.

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Call MCIWndRegisterClass(HINSTANCE hInst) to register the new Window Class "MCIWND_WINDOW_CLASS".  This function returns TRUE if successful.

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Use the standard windows function CreateWindow() to create a window to play an MCI file inside of.

	or...

	Use the MCIWndCreate(HWND hwndParent, HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD dwStyle, LPSTR szFile) function.  This takes the place of CreateWindow() and has the advantage of being able to open an MCI device in the same call as the window is created in. NOTE:  You do not need to call MCIWndRegisterClass() if you use this function, only if you use CreateWindow().

	For non-windowed devices, you will need a window to hold the toolbar and trackbar.  If there will be no controls, and you are playing a non-windowed device (EG playing a Sound file) you may want to leave the window invisible.

	For both of these calls, you have some new styles you can choose from as well as the standard window styles.  They are as follows:

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOAUTOSIZEWINDOW	Never automatically resize the window.  By default, the window size will change automatically to reflect any change in the size of the windowed device's picture (for a windowed device).  The window is also automatically resized whenever a new file is opened or closed.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOAUTOSIZEMOVIE	Never automatically change the size of the device's playback window image to match the new size of the MCI window when it changes.  For MCI devices that can window (have video to display), MCIWND will ordinarily resize the image to any size you make the window.  

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOPLAYBAR		Do not put a playbar (Toolbar and Trackbar) in the window.  By default, a playbar appears.  It provides a PLAY, STOP, RECORD and MENU button (when appropriate), as well as a Trackbar to seek through the file.

	
	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOMENU		Do not provide a pop-up menu or a menu button on the playbar.  Normally, pressing the right mouse button over the window will bring up a track menu with some common commands.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_RECORD		Provide a record button on the playbar or menu, if the device supports it, and a file "new" command.  By default, only the non-destructive commands are available on the playbar and menu.
	
	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOERRORDLG	Will prevent MCIWND from bringing up an error dialog box whenever someone sends the window an MCI command that fails.  If your application is interested in knowing the most recent error, it can use the MCIWndGetError() macro.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOTIFYMODE	Whenever the state of the device changes (eg. from Stop to Play) the parent window will receive a MCIWNDM_NOTIFYMODE msg with an lParam of the new state of the device (eg. MCI_MODE_STOP).  The application can get the text string of the new mode by using the MCIWndGetMode() macro.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOTIFYPOS		Whenever the position of the device changes (eg. as it's playing) the parent window will receive a MCIWNDM_NOTIFYPOS msg with an lParam of the new position in the media.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOTIFYMEDIA	Whenever a file is opened or closed, or a new device is loaded, the parent window will receive a MCIWNDM_NOTIFYMEDIA msg with an lParam of the new filename.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_NOTIFYSIZE		Whenever the size of the MCI playback area changes (which may also affect the size of the MCI window if the MCIWNDF_NOAUTOSIZEWINDOW flag is off), the parent will receive a MCIWNDM_NOTIFYSIZE msg.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_SHOWNAME		Sets the window text of the window to the filename of any MCI file you open in this window.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_SHOWPOS		Sets the window text of the window to include the position of the device.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWNDF_SHOWMODE		Sets the window text of the window to the mode of the MCI device (eg. "playing" or "stopped")

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	To open an MCI file or device using the macro MCIWndOpen(HWND hwnd, LPSTR sz, UINT f).  Hwnd is the window you have created, and sz is the name of the file or device to open.   F is currently unused and should be set to 0.
	
SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	To bring up an open dialog and let the user choose a file to open into the window, use MCIWndOpenDialog(hwnd).

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	To open a new (empty) file to record into, use MCIWndNew(HWND hwnd, LPSTR sz).  Set sz to the name of the device you wish to create a new file for.

SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	Send the window a command using one of the following macros.  Unless otherwise specified, the return code is the same as you would get from mciSendString() using the same command.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndClose(hwnd)		Close the MCI file.  You can then re-open another file in the same window, or just call open again and the currrent file will close automatically.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPlay(hwnd)		Play the file from the current position.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndStop(hwnd)		Stops the device.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPause(hwnd)		Pauses the device.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndResume(hwnd)		Resumes playing (after a pause).

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSeek(hwnd, lPos)		Seeks to a specified position in the file.  The units depend on the current time format of the device.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndHome(hwnd)		Seek to the beginning of the media.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndEnd(hwnd)		Seek to the end of the media.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndRecord(hwnd)		Record into either or new or existing file at the current position.  To stop recording, use MCIWndStop(hwnd).
	
	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndEject(hwnd)		Ejects the media (eg. for a CDAUDIO device).

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPlayReverse(hwnd)	Play the file backwards starting at the current position.	

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPlayFrom(hwnd, lpos)	Play the file forward starting at the specified position.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPlayTo(hwnd, lpos)	Play from the current position to the specified position.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndPlayFromTo(hwnd, lFrom, lTo)	Play the specified section.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetRepeat(hwnd, f)	From now on, all PLAY commands sent will repeat if f is TRUE, or not repeat, if f is FALSE.  Default is FALSE.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetRepeat(hwnd)		Gets the status of the repeat flag, as set by MCIWndSetRepeat.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetMode(hwnd)		Returns the current mode of the device (eg. MCI_MODE_PLAY.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetDeviceID(hwnd)	Gets the deviceID of the open file which you will need if you wish to call mciSendCommand to do any commands that are not supported by this interface.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetAlias(hwnd)		Gets the alias of the open file which you will need if you wish to call mciSendString to do any commands that are not supported by this interface.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetPosition(hwnd)	Returns the current position in the file.  The units for this and the following positions depend on the current time format.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetPositionString(hwnd, lp, len)	Returns the current position in the file, just as MCIWndGetPosition does.  But it also fills the string pointed to by lp (up to a length of len) with a string description of the position, usually just the string version of the integer returned by the function.  However, for a device that supports tracks, it will give you a pretty printed position of the form "TT:MM:SS:FF" (tracks, minutes, seconds, frames).

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetStart(hwnd)		Returns the starting position of the file.  Seeking here will place the file at the beginning

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetLength(hwnd)	Returns the length of the file.  The start plus the length will give you the end of the media.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetEnd(hwnd)		Returns the end position of the file.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndStep(hwnd, n)		Steps n frames or milliseconds, depending on the time format of the device.  A positive value is a step forward.  A negative value is a step backwards.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndDestroy(hwnd)		Destroys the window.  No return code.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetZoom(hwnd, n)	For windowed devices, sets the size of the device's playback window to n percent of its original (authored) size.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetZoom(hwnd)		Returns the last value set with the MCIWndSetZoom() macro.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetVolume(hwnd, n)	Sets the volume of audio playback (if supported) to n.  1000 is normal volume.  Higher numbers are louder.  Lower numbers are quieter.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetVolume(hwnd)	Gets the current volume.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetSpeed(hwnd, n)	Sets the playback speed of the device (if supported) to n.  1000 is normal speed.  Higher numbers are faster.  Lower numbers are slower.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetSpeed(hwnd)		Gets the playback speed of the device.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndRealize(hwnd, f)		Tells MCI to realize the palette of the image it is displaying in the window.  f is TRUE if the window is in a background application.  You should call this function in your app's WM_PALETTECHANGED and WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE code, instead of using the standard windows function RealizePalette.  This MCIWnd function will use the palette of the MCI device and call RealizePalette for you.  On the other hand, you could just pass the WM_PALETTECHANGED or WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE msg on to the MCI window and this will happen automatically.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSendString(hwnd, sz)	Takes the place of mciSendString(sz, NULL, 0, NULL).  Simply give the string to send to the window.  Leave out the alias after the first word.  (eg.  sz = "set time format frames" is a valid command).

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetError(hwnd, lp, len)	Gets the most recent error returned by the last command you executed.  The return value is the error code.  If  lp is a valid pointer, the text of the error string will be returned in lp up to a maximum length of len.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetTimeFormat(hwnd, lp)	Sets the time format of the device to the string supplied.  (Eg.  "frames" or "milliseconds").  Other formats may be supported by some devices, but may have a strange affect on the scroll bar if the position values are not continuous (eg. tracks or SMPTE time format).  For these devices you may wish to turn the playbar off (use the MCIWNDF_NOPLAYBAR flag).  The time format of the device determines how to interpret a position in the file.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetTimeFormat(hwnd, lp, len)	Gets the current time format of the device.  The code for the time format is returned by the macro.  If lp is a valid pointer, the text of the time format mode will be returned in lp up to a maximum length of len.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndUseTime(hwnd)
	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h  MCIWndUseFrames(hwnd)	A quick way to set the time format of the device to either milliseconds or frames mode.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndValidateMedia(hwnd)	If you ever do anything to a device that changes the time format of the media (like changing time formats in some other way than by using an MCIWnd macro) the starting and ending position of the media, as well as the trackbar will still be using the old values, and need to be updated.  Send this message to update these values.  Normally, you should not need to use this macro. 
	

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetActiveTimer(hwnd, n)	This value determines how often MCIWND will poll to update the scrollbar, or the position reported in the window caption, or notify the parent of some change to the media.  This number determines the number of milliseconds between updates when the MCIWND window is the active window.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetInactiveTimer(hwnd, n)	This value determines how often MCIWND will poll to update the scrollbar, or the position reported in the window caption, or notify the parent of some change to the media.  This number determines the number of milliseconds between updates when the MCIWND window is the inactive window.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetTimers(hwnd, active, inactive)	This macro will set both values at once, but the values are limited to 16 bit quantities.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetActiveTimer(hwnd)	Returns the value of the active timer.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetInactiveTimer(hwnd)	Returns the value of the inactive timer.  The default is 2000 milliseconds.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetPalette(hwnd)		Returns the palette being used by the windowed device to display its image.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndSetPalette(hwnd, hpal)	Tells the windowed device to use the specified palette for displaying its image.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetFilename(hwnd, lp, len)	Returns the filename currently being used by the open MCI device in lp, up to a maximum of len characters.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetDevice(hwnd, lp, len)	Returns the name of the currently open MCI device in lp, up to a maximum of len characters.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndGetStyles(hwnd)		Returns the current style of the MCIWND window.  This value is the bitwise or of all the MCIWNDF_* values that were set when the window was created, or set by the MCIWndChangeStyles() macro.

	SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h	MCIWndChangeStyles(hwnd, mask, value)	Changes the style of the MCIWND window.  Mask is the bitwise or of all the MCIWNDF_* flags that you wish to add or remove.

Notes on conversion from win3.1 to NT.
======================================

1. Change from MSCDEX to NT CDRom driver IOCTLs.

   -- Driver sharing capabilities (??) - does the driver allow anything ?
   -- Drive labelling (config stuff too).


   Problems :

       Apparently no SCSI-2 command to tell if the tray is open.

   For now the only conditions we detect are the PLAY_STATUS conditions
   and inability to read the TOC.  We only read the TOC when asked to
   by CdReady or CdGetNumTracks.

2. Device sharing implications ??

   Seems at the moment that ANYONE can open CDRom (is it exclusive ?).

   The MCICDA on windows allows sharing between apps.  This means we
   need a server implementation or a kernel driver or just proper
   sharing access in the kernel driver (what should be access required
   for playing CDs ?).

3. Beware track numbering problems - is there always a 1 ?

4. PAUSE-RESUME.  This is effectively NOOPED (or at least the RESUME is).
   So PAUSE always stops.

   Underneath in MSCDEX the thing they're fighting is that PAUSE while
   PAUSEd STOPs (ie forgets its PAUSED).  Also MSCDEX calls PAUSE
   STOP.

   In NT to STOP we ... ?


5. A BASIC problem with the way all this stuff is written is that
   it's written by people all the way over to CDEX land.
   The devices report status AFTER they've tried to do what you want.
   This helps greatly with integrity.  The code is written with all
   kinds of defensive test BEFORE issuing a command which is pretty
   bogus.

6. flip3, flip4 etc.  Change these to portable versions where necessary.
   (flip4 seems OK and fits in with other poor implementations).

Notes :

   mciGetDriverData returns a pointer to the stream - SeqStreamType so
   the stream is equated to a logical device.

   GETMOTWORD = 'Get Motorola word' (!)

   Within the timer interrupt routine use the critical section to get
   the other side of the mutual exclusion.

   SERIALIZATION :  A critical section is used which is held over calls
   to mciDriverEntry and in the sequencer tasks but released when
   getting messages (blocking) or temporarily while yielding.

Tasking structure :

 Application task :
    mcicmds.c!msOpen
         |
         V
    mciseq.c!msOpenStream -> mmTaskCreate with routine mciStreamCycle
                         |
                         V
                    TaskSignal
                    PostAppMessage
                         .
                         . WTM_QUITTASK, WTM_DONEPLAY, WTM_FILLBUFFER
                         .
 Sequencer task :

                    GetMessage
                    TaskBlock
                         |
                         V
               mciseq.c!mciStreamCycle
                         |
                         V
               mmseq.c!midiSeqMessage - SEQ_TRACKDATA, SEQ_SETPORTOFF
                                            |          SEQ_GETINFO
                                            V
                                        NewTrackData


mciStreamCycle just keeps the buffers for the current stream stoked up.

Thus : there is 1 (extra) task PER LOGICAL DEVICE.
There is 1 SEQ structure per task and 1 stream structure per task (which
contains an HMIDISEQ handle hSeq to the SEQ structure).  The SEQ
structure remembers the HTASK.


The SeqStreamType structure is the per-stream data on the MCI side.
This is unfortunately shared between application and stream tasks.


There is no need to inhibit threading between sequencer tasks, only
between the main task and associated sequencer tasks.

Use of Yield etc :

    mciseq.c!msOpenStream - appears to have a spurious yield near the start

    mcicmds.c!msOpen - calls Yield to allow the stream task to start
        properly.  We need to force this to happen now.  Note that this
        is subtle because multiple people might be running - so we
        probably need a special event per task.

    mcicmds.c!msPlay - sits in a loop at the moment !  Need the event
                       again.

    mmseq NEVER yields or blocks

    mciseq.c!mciStreamCycle :
           TaskBlock near start when finished init - other side of
           Yield in msOpen.  Also later Blocks again for more work.
           This is the other side of msPlay ?

           mmTaskYeild - probably unnecessary since nothing was kicked off ?

......................................................................


MIDISEQ_DONE


Timers :
========

util.c!OneShotTimer has pointer to NPSEQ structure passed to it.

         --> mmseq.c!TimerIntRoutine
         |
         |
util.c!MIDICallback

Conversion Issues

    tasking
    File format
      Seems OK because :

      1. mmio... is used to get at the chunks
      2. The data is in big-endian format and macros are used which will
         work for either format (GETMODWORD, GETMOTDWORD etc).

    file access

      OK - via MMIO

    parameter sizes
    api
    build
    globals
      list.c - arrayOfLists

    window messages
    alignment / structure packing / structure overlays



Comments :
==========

1. This code is essentially uncommented.  On the positive side the
   structure is reasonably clean (though overcomplex and relying
   on 'messages' (untyped calls) rather than subroutine calls which
   means many bugs will get by the compiler into runtime code.

BUGS

o  What should we map to?
      The following needs to be supported in the CPL.

      1) Many to many:
         For output this would allow multiple applications
         to open the mapper and we would merge this midi data
         to ALL output midi devices.

         For input this would allow multiple applications
         to open the mapper and we would merge the midi
         data from ALL midi input devices and send it to 
         ALL the applications.

      2) Many to one:
         For output this would allow multiple applications to
         open the mapper and we would merge the data from the
         applications to a single midi device.

         For input this would allow multiple applications to 
         open the mapper and we would route the input from a
         single midi device to all applications.

      3) One to many:
         For output this would allow a single application to
         open the mapper and we would route the data received 
         from the application to all devcies.

         For input this would allow a single application to 
         open the mapper and we would merge the data received
         from all devices to this application.
   

      4) One to one:
         For output this would allow a single application to
         open the mapper and we would map the data to a single
         midi device.

         For input this would allow a single application to 
         open the mapper and we would map the data from a
         single midi device to this application.

   o  Do i autodoc the sample code? including the midimapper?

   o  We need to do something about error codes.....
      For any error conditions that need expalanation we
      should Log the error.

   o  How should i process the other MXDM_* messages?
         -  MODM_RESET
         -  MODM_POLYMSG

         -  MIDM_POLYMSG

The definitive reference for MIDI Mapper's registry entries.

Aliases are kept in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE because they describe the hardware
setup (instrument-port-driver mapping) and are therefore global to the
machine.

Schemes are also global because we want at least the default schemes (which
map all 16 channels to one instrument on a port) to be available to all users.

The current scheme is stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

This is a little subproject for Win32 Sound Recorder (SNDREC32.EXE).

This version of Sound Recorder is the merge of 2 parallel projects.
A-CliffG (Cliff Grabhorn: 404-378-5965) ported the NT 1.0 application
to OLE 2.0.  In order to support ACM, LaurieGr ported the VFW/Bombay
soundrecorder that was ACM aware to Win32.  After this, JohnYG merged
the two parallel efforts.

There are 2 essential subdirectories:

\+---SoundRec
 |
 +---O2Base

SoundRec contains the primary application sources.

O2Base is a class library that SoundRec is dependant on to provide
all OLE 2.0 support and debugging.  O2Base includes full support
for in-place editing and other useful OLE functionality.  Check it out!

SoundRec is dependant upon O2Base.LIB and so, must be
build *last*.

This function plays a waveform sound.

The function can play wave resources from an application, or wave files named either explicitly or via an alias in the [sounds] section of WIN.INI.

Parameter	Type/Description

lpszName	LPSTR  Points to the name of the resource, file or alias of the sound to be played.

hModule	HANDLE  If lpszName is the name of a resource then this parameter supplies the handle of the module from which the resource is to be loaded.

dwFlags	DWORD   Specifies the nature of lpszName and how the sound should be played.

Value	Meaning

SND_ALIAS	The lpszName parameter is an entry in the [sounds] section of WIN.INI of the form:  alias=filename.  filename is an unqualified, partially or fully qualified name of a waveform file.  See the description of the OpenFile API for how the file is found.  May not be used with either SND_FILENAME or SND_RESOURCE.

SND_FILENAME 	The lpszName parameter is the name of a wave file.  May not be used with either SND_ALIAS or SND_RESOURCE.

SND_RESOURCE	The lpszName parameter is the name of a resource.  May not be used with either SND_ALIAS or SND_FILENAME.

SND_ASYNC	Specifies that the sound should be played asynchronously.  The call to PlaySound will return as soon as the sound is started.  May not be used with SND_SYNC.

SND_SYNC	Specifies that the sound should be played synchronously.  The call to PlaySound will not return until the sound has completed playing.  May not be used with SND_ASYNC.
	This is the default mode of playing.

SND_NODEFAULT	This flag may be used in conjunction with the SND_ALIAS flag to prevent the default system sound being played if the alias supplied by the lpszName parameter cannot be found.

SND_NOWAIT	When this flag is set, the call to PlaySound will fail if no suitable wave device is immediately available to play the sound.   If this flag is not set, then, assuming that there is at least one wave device in the system, the call will wait for a wave device to become available.


Return Value	

The return value is TRUE if the sound is played and FALSE if not.  Note that if the SND_ASYNC flag is set a return value of TRUE indicates only that the thread has started which will attempt to play the sound.  There is no indication that the sound will actually be played.

Comments

The PlaySound function provides a simple mechanism to play wave files and wave files built into an application as resources of type WAVE.  To add a wave file to an application, the resource file should have an entry of this form:

	SoundName	WAVE		ding.wav

The resource can then be played by calling:

	PlaySound("SoundName", hModule, SND_RESOURCE);

Note that for all cases, the application must have enough memory quota to map the entire file into memory.  This limits the file size which can be played to about 250 k bytes.

When playing an alias name from WIN.INI the default action is to search for the given name and if not found to search for the SystemDefault entry and play that sound.  If  the application does not want the default sound to be played it should set the SND_NODEFAULT flag.

This is only a very brief overview.  There is quite a bit of
additional documentation in the source code itself.


Goals of robust tesselation
---------------------------

The tesselation algorithm is fundamentally a 2D algorithm.  We
initially project all data into a plane; our goal is to robustly
tesselate the projected data.  The same topological tesselation is
then applied to the input data.

Topologically, the output should always be a tesselation.  If the
input is even slightly non-planar, then some triangles will
necessarily be back-facing when viewed from some angles, but the goal
is to minimize this effect.

The algorithm needs some capability of cleaning up the input data as
well as the numerical errors in its own calculations.  One way to do
this is to specify a tolerance as defined above, and clean up the
input and output during the line sweep process.  At the very least,
the algorithm must handle coincident vertices, vertices incident to an
edge, and coincident edges.


Phases of the algorithm
-----------------------

1. Find the polygon normal N.
2. Project the vertex data onto a plane.  It does not need to be
   perpendicular to the normal, eg. we can project onto the plane
   perpendicular to the coordinate axis whose dot product with N
   is largest.
3. Using a line-sweep algorithm, partition the plane into x-monotone
   regions.  Any vertical line intersects an x-monotone region in
   at most one interval.
4. Triangulate the x-monotone regions.
5. Group the triangles into strips and fans.


Finding the normal vector
-------------------------

A common way to find a polygon normal is to compute the signed area
when the polygon is projected along the three coordinate axes.  We
can't do this, since contours can have zero area without being
degenerate (eg. a bowtie).

We fit a plane to the vertex data, ignoring how they are connected
into contours.  Ideally this would be a least-squares fit; however for
our purpose the accuracy of the normal is not important.  Instead we
find three vertices which are widely separated, and compute the normal
to the triangle they form.  The vertices are chosen so that the
triangle has an area at least 1/sqrt(3) times the largest area of any
triangle formed using the input vertices.  

The contours do affect the orientation of the normal; after computing
the normal, we check that the sum of the signed contour areas is
non-negative, and reverse the normal if necessary.


Projecting the vertices
-----------------------

We project the vertices onto a plane perpendicular to one of the three
coordinate axes.  This helps numerical accuracy by removing a
transformation step between the original input data and the data
processed by the algorithm.  The projection also compresses the input
data; the 2D distance between vertices after projection may be smaller
than the original 2D distance.  However by choosing the coordinate
axis whose dot product with the normal is greatest, the compression
factor is at most 1/sqrt(3).

Even though the *accuracy* of the normal is not that important (since
we are projecting perpendicular to a coordinate axis anyway), the
*robustness* of the computation is important.  For example, if there
are many vertices which lie almost along a line, and one vertex V
which is well-separated from the line, then our normal computation
should involve V otherwise the results will be garbage.

The advantage of projecting perpendicular to the polygon normal is
that computed intersection points will be as close as possible to
their ideal locations.  To get this behavior, define TRUE_PROJECT.


The Line Sweep
--------------

There are three data structures: the mesh, the event queue, and the
edge dictionary.

The mesh is a "quad-edge" data structure which records the topology of
the current decomposition; for details see the include file "mesh.h".

The event queue simply holds all vertices (both original and computed
ones), organized so that we can quickly extract the vertex with the
minimum x-coord (and among those, the one with the minimum y-coord).

The edge dictionary describes the current intersection of the sweep
line with the regions of the polygon.  This is just an ordering of the
edges which intersect the sweep line, sorted by their current order of
intersection.  For each pair of edges, we store some information about
the monotone region between them -- these are call "active regions"
(since they are crossed by the current sweep line).

The basic algorithm is to sweep from left to right, processing each
vertex.  The processed portion of the mesh (left of the sweep line) is
a planar decomposition.  As we cross each vertex, we update the mesh
and the edge dictionary, then we check any newly adjacent pairs of
edges to see if they intersect.

A vertex can have any number of edges.  Vertices with many edges can
be created as vertices are merged and intersection points are
computed.  For unprocessed vertices (right of the sweep line), these
edges are in no particular order around the vertex; for processed
vertices, the topological ordering should match the geometric ordering.

The vertex processing happens in two phases: first we process are the
left-going edges (all these edges are currently in the edge
dictionary).  This involves:

 - deleting the left-going edges from the dictionary;
 - relinking the mesh if necessary, so that the order of these edges around
   the event vertex matches the order in the dictionary;
 - marking any terminated regions (regions which lie between two left-going
   edges) as either "inside" or "outside" according to their winding number.

When there are no left-going edges, and the event vertex is in an
"interior" region, we need to add an edge (to split the region into
monotone pieces).  To do this we simply join the event vertex to the
rightmost left endpoint of the upper or lower edge of the containing
region.

Then we process the right-going edges.  This involves:

 - inserting the edges in the edge dictionary;
 - computing the winding number of any newly created active regions.
   We can compute this incrementally using the winding of each edge
   that we cross as we walk through the dictionary.
 - relinking the mesh if necessary, so that the order of these edges around
   the event vertex matches the order in the dictionary;
 - checking any newly adjacent edges for intersection and/or merging.

If there are no right-going edges, again we need to add one to split
the containing region into monotone pieces.  In our case it is most
convenient to add an edge to the leftmost right endpoint of either
containing edge; however we may need to change this later (see the
code for details).


Invariants
----------

These are the most important invariants maintained during the sweep.
We define a function VertLeq(v1,v2) which defines the order in which
vertices cross the sweep line, and a function EdgeLeq(e1,e2; loc)
which says whether e1 is below e2 at the sweep event location "loc".
This function is defined only at sweep event locations which lie
between the rightmost left endpoint of {e1,e2}, and the leftmost right
endpoint of {e1,e2}.

Invariants for the Edge Dictionary.

 - Each pair of adjacent edges e2=Succ(e1) satisfies EdgeLeq(e1,e2)
   at any valid location of the sweep event.
 - If EdgeLeq(e2,e1) as well (at any valid sweep event), then e1 and e2
   share a common endpoint.
 - For each e in the dictionary, e->Dst has been processed but not e->Org.
 - Each edge e satisfies VertLeq(e->Dst,event) && VertLeq(event,e->Org)
   where "event" is the current sweep line event.
 - No edge e has zero length.
 - No two edges have identical left and right endpoints.
 
Invariants for the Mesh (the processed portion).

 - The portion of the mesh left of the sweep line is a planar graph,
   ie. there is *some* way to embed it in the plane.
 - No processed edge has zero length.
 - No two processed vertices have identical coordinates.
 - Each "inside" region is monotone, ie. can be broken into two chains
   of monotonically increasing vertices according to VertLeq(v1,v2)
   - a non-invariant: these chains may intersect (slightly) due to
     numerical errors, but this does not affect the algorithm's operation.

Invariants for the Sweep.

 - If a vertex has any left-going edges, then these must be in the edge
   dictionary at the time the vertex is processed.
 - If an edge is marked "fixUpperEdge" (it is a temporary edge introduced
   by ConnectRightVertex), then it is the only right-going edge from
   its associated vertex.  (This says that these edges exist only
   when it is necessary.)


Robustness
----------

The key to the robustness of the algorithm is maintaining the
invariants above, especially the correct ordering of the edge
dictionary.  We achieve this by:

  1. Writing the numerical computations for maximum precision rather
     than maximum speed.
     
  2. Making no assumptions at all about the results of the edge
     intersection calculations -- for sufficiently degenerate inputs,
     the computed location is not much better than a random number.
     
  3. When numerical errors violate the invariants, restore them
     by making *topological* changes when necessary (ie. relinking
     the mesh structure).
     
     
Triangulation and Grouping
--------------------------

We finish the line sweep before doing any triangulation.  This is
because even after a monotone region is complete, there can be further
changes to its vertex data because of further vertex merging.

After triangulating all monotone regions, we want to group the
triangles into fans and strips.  We do this using a greedy approach.
The triangulation itself is not optimized to reduce the number of
primitives; we just try to get a reasonable decomposition of the
computed triangulation.

Originally, TK and AUX were maintained as separate libraries (LIBTK.LIB
and LIBAUX.LIB).  Later, they were combined via a hacked up makefile
into a single library, GLAUX.LIB.  However, to make the build process
cleaner, the TK source files have been moved into the libaux directory
(with the prefix "tk" prepended to the filenames to prevent name
collisions with the aux files.  This also makes it easy to identify the
TK source files) where everything is compiled into GLAUX.LIB.

This directory remains to preserve the history of changes made to
TK.

net/atm
    this sub-project contains implementation of ATM-related technologies.
    this includes the lane, rawwan, and uni drivers, atm samples, as well as
    the winsock2 service provider which exposes rawwan to winsock clients.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/atm.h moved to newnt:net/atm/genx/inc/atm.w because this
    file is published to the DDK.  it was given a .w extension so that it
    can be run through the "cleansing" process (which takes care of copyright
    headers, etc) before being published.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/atm40.h moved to newnt:net/atm/inc.

    oldnt:inc/laneinfo.h moved to newnt:net/inc.  it is used by net/config
    so it needs visibility outside of net/atm.  recommend it be renamed
    with an atm prefix -- e.g. atmlanep.h

    oldnt:inc/rawanuser.h moved to netnt:net/atm/inc since the service
    provider implemnetation now lives under net/atm.  this header no longer
    needs to have global visibility because it is only included by files
    under net/atm.

    oldnt:inc/ws2atmsp.h moved to newnt:net/atm/inc since the service
    provider implementation now lives under net/atm.  this header no longer
    needs to have global visibility because it is only included by files
    under net/atm.

net/dlc
    this sub-project builds the DLC driver as well as the user mode api.

    oldnt:net/dlc moved to newnt:net/dlc/api
    oldnt:ntos/dlc moved to newnt:net/dlc/driver

net/ndis
    this sub-project contains the implementation of ndis.sys.  it specifically
    DOES NOT contain any and all ndis miniports.  most ndis drivers for OEM
    hardware have moved to the Drivers project.

    oldnt:inc/ndispnp.h moved to newnt:net/ndis/genx/inc because this file
    is published internally for other projects to use.  it was given a .w
    extension so that it can be run through the "cleansing" process.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/ndis*.h moved to newnt:net/ndis/sys because these headers
    were only included by code under net/ndis/sys.  (Except for ndiswah.h
    which moved to newnt:net/inc.)

net/sfm
    this sub-project contains the implementation of Services for Macintosh

    rules.mk files were not brought over since they relied on the outdated
    net\ui project.

net/tcpip
    this sub-project contains the implementation of TCP/IP, it's command-line
    utilities, APIs, and services.

    /apis     - user-mode programattic APIs expsosed via DLL.
    /commands - command line utitlies that ship with the product.
    /driver   - tcpip.sys
    /services - TCP/IP services (e.g. RIP Listener, Echo, Chargen, TFTP, etc.)
    /tools    - Internal tools and test programs that do not ship.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/trace (trace.dll) was dropped.  rtutils.dll exports
    the same functionality.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/relay (relay.dll and router.exe) was dropped.
    this is the DHCP relay agent which is no longer standalone.
    it's functionality is now provided by rras.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/routetab (routetab.dll) was dropped.  iphlpapi.dll
    exports the same functionality for NT5.  Win9x shares this source, so it
    may be that we need to bring it over to newnt eventually.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/winipcfg was dropped.  It is not listed in layout.inf
    so it seems it is not shipped.  (Althought I think it is shipped in
    Windows 9x.)

net/tdi
    this sub-project contains the implementation of tdi.sys.  it specifically
    DOES NOT contain any and all tdi providers.

    oldnt:inc/tdi*.h moved to newnt:newnt/tdi/genx/inc/tdi*.w since
    they are published internally to NT.

	// to be locked on entry, it can do something like:

Enumeration functions

	WeakEnumerateList(list, pfn) -- calls pfn on each item in the list, but releasing
	list lock before calling pfn. Since it releases the list lock, it can't simply
	process the elements in order.

	Several flavors of these enumeration functions:
	1. Enumerate holding list lock and object lock throughout -- strict enumeration.
	2. While(change) {Run-through-items until lock released}
	3. Optimistic, weak enumeration -- maintain next pointer within list structure,
	   if next pointer matches when you next get list lock, use it, otherwise

	4. Concept of using a "impromptu list", using the pTmpNext field --
	 optimisically, all the objects that need to be worked on will have their
	 pTmpNext field unused (set to an illegal value) so can be used to set up
	 a temporary list -- no needto synchronize access to this list -- only the
	 creator can use it and must disband it (set pTmpNext members back to the
	 illegal value)  when done. Potential of having multiple pTmpNext fields
	 to minimize risk of collisions if objects are heavily used.

	5. Enumeration of functions that use only static-data -- no need to claim lock.
	6. Various search/modify funcions -- enumeration could return a single one, or
	   a (perhaps impromptu) list of objects found by the the function, or
	   could delete the objects found by the function.


	Goal is to not to require user code to have to enumerate lists explicitly, 
	and to minimize the amount of explicit lock and refcount manipulation.
	[Enumeration functions hide any temprefing done]

temporary combo impromptu list + temp-list:
typedef struct
{
	OBJECT *pImpromptuList;
	SLIST *pOthers;         // these ones had the pTmpNext field in use so we
							// explicitly create an SLIST of pointers to these.
} ENUMERATION_RESULT;

FreeEnumerationResult(ENUMERATION_RESULT *ER, STACKRECORD *pSR, BOOLEAN fDeref)
{
	// run throuch impromptu list, de-refing the tempref.
	OBJECT *pObj = pER->pImpromptuList;
	while (pObj!=NULL)
	{
		OBJECT *pNextObj = pObj->pTmpNext;
		pObj->TmpNext = ILLEGAL_POINTER;

		if (fDeref)
		{
			Lock(pObj, pSR);
			TmpDeref(pObj, pSR);
			Unlock(&pObj, pSR); // if object has gone, pObj will be set to NULL.
		}

		pObj = pNextObj;
	}

	// Run through pOthers list;
	while (pOthers != NULL)
	{
		Pop(&Others, &pObj);
		if (bDeref)
		{
			Lock(pObj, pSR);
			TmpDeref(pObj, pSR);
			Unlock(&pObj, pSR); // if object has gone, pObj will be set to NULL.
		}
	}

}

Locking:
	bit in lock struture can be set to prevent unlocking -- preventing a lower-level
	function from temporarily unlocking/locking a function

Tasks -- should be associated with the adapter/interface, not each object -- because tasks -- hmm well maybe let each object decide. Timers -- are they tasks?

You can have a "primary state change task pointer " for an object -- at any one time
an object can have only one such task active, although it may vary depending on the
state change involve -- eg ConnectCallTask to move fron unconnected to connected,
and  DisconnectCallTask to move from connected to unconnected.
The object's primary state should reflect the task running:
 unconnected, connecting*, connected, disconnecting* (* means that a state-change
 task is running).

A task can register itself to pend until some other particular task is completed.
When a task completes it's list of other tasks are completed one by one, making
sure locks and inter-task refcounts are properly maintained.


ValidateXXXPacket function -- verifies that internal structures of incoming packets are valid, i.e., fields like sizes and offsets don't point to locations outside the packet.

Concept of Collections  of objects -- hides details of how the collection is organized -- hash table, list, hybrid, etc , alloc/dealloc,

Use arrays of pointers freely. Possibly keep a dynamic estimate the the size
of these arrays to allocate.

Dynamic array class:
typedef struct
{
	UINT TotalSize;
	UINT UsedSize;
	PVOID Array;		<< reallocate if limit is reached, copying from old array.
} DYNAMIC_POINTER_ARRAY;

Could release cached empty resources every minute so.

StateHistory: each entry is a pair: LUID describing where state was changed and
the acutual state.

LinkRecord -- each entry is a pair: LUID describing where the link was made and
the actual object linked to.

	Local variable used to verify that all locks claimed were released.
	Root task id can be used in logging.

	Initially label all assert cheking in retail -- log number of asserts hit
	in a global variable.

	Keep all static info about an object together -- no need to get lock when
	looking at that data.

	Does it make sense to simply use InterlockedIncrement/Decrement to maintain
	refcounts -- not require locking?

Locking:
	tasks-allocators, groups, etc, have their own locks, which are
	only used by the rm apis, and never locked *across* APIS. This allows
	them to be used independently of any other locks that may be held.
	For simplicity, we can have a single "rm_private_lock" for this purpose.

	-- think about using the resource tracking apis, as well as implementing the
	   extra checking in the LinkObjects code above.

2/8/1999 JosephJ
	Re-think the allocation of tasks ...
	- allocation handled by user, allowing user to embed tasks in objects, add
	  specialized fields and so on.
	- no "private context" -- any private context is expected to be allocated by
	  the user. Typically each task consists of the standard task header followed
	  by any private data.

	Todo:
	1. revise task apis to reflect above change.
	2. revise tests

2/11/1999 JosephJ
	Decide to claim both pOtherTask and pTask's locks (in order) in
	PendTaskOnOtherTasks. It is possible to deadlock if pTaskA tries to pend to
	pend on pTaskB at the same time that pTaskB tries to pend on pTaskA, but that
	is not a valid thing to try to do anyway.

	Of course, one thing we can do is to 1st lock the pointer that is greater
	in value.

	Hit the following:

	Fix:

2/22/1999 JosephJ Fast Send Path

 Use of RouteCacheEntry.
 	We (arp module) has use of RouteCacheEntry.rce_context,  (private\inc\ip.h)
 	which is of size RCE_CONTEXT_SIZE, which is defined to be 2*sizeof(void*).

 	So we can hold 2 pointers there.

 	RCE is valid memory from the point it shows up in our iptransmit function until
 	it is invalidated by a call to our invalidate-rce function.

 In order to make the fast-send-path as fast as possible, but still allow for
 invalidating the RCE when the mapping from IP->VC breaks down, we'll use the
 RCE as in atmarpc.sys: it contains (a) ptr to a pIP structure and (b) pointer
 to the next RCE entry associated with the same pIP structure.

 However, to speed things up, pIP will contain a pfnTransmit function which will
 be set to a fast-transmit-function when conditions are ideal (mapping from 
 pIP to pVC exists, valid pVC). pfnTransmit will be set to other transmit
 functions if the conditions are less-than-ideal. These functions will queue 
 the packet if registration is in progress, or may fail the packet if IP entry
 is in the process of being aborted.

2/23/1999 JosephJ Task params
 One option is to initialize the private portion of the task with whatever paramters
 required *before* calling RmStartTask -- no need to pass in those paramters
 using the single UserParam field.


2/23/1999 JosephJ  RmUnloadAllObjecsInGroup:

  New rm function RmUnloadAllObjecsInGroup:
  	internally creates a task and in the context of that tasks, unloads all the
  	objects in the group one-by-one.

  One cool feature is that if RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup is called several
  times on the same group, the "correct" thing happens: all will complete after
  all the objects are unloaded.

2/23/1999 JosephJ  Timers
	To get exactly-once and proper abort semantics, consider calling the timer
	handler with the object's lock held.

	TODO:

3/1/1999 JosephJ Summary of associations:
	Instead of separately tracking who's linked to who, who is a parent/child of who,
	which tasks are running, etc., and also to allow arbitrary associations to be made
	(and later unmade), I introduced the concept of "associations", which are
	triples: The association is defined by the triple
	(Entity1, Entity2, AssociationID) -- only ONE such tuple may
	be registered at any time with object pParentObject.
	Note: It is valid for both of the following to be registered at the same
	time: (a, b, 1) and (a, b, 2)
	No association should exist at the point the object is deleted.

	Associations are implemented using a hash table, which is located in
	the diagnostic-info part of an object.

3/1/1999 JosephJ Associations and debugprinting
	Added support for printing information about all outstanding associations for
	a particular object. The format of the display is controlled by the caller
	of RmDbgAddAssociation -- the caller passes in an optional format string to
	be used when displaying the association.

	The amazing thing is that after I got this to work with the user-mode

	was just perfect, including the rather hairy dumping of associations.

03/04/1999  JosephJ MCast address adds/removes.
	From IP/ATM code, we see that we may get multiple adds for the same
	address, and hence we need to maintain ref counts on these entries.

	This is not the case for unicast addresses.

	Since I am treating all types of IP addresses the same as far as
	liveness is concerned, I will keep add/remove ref counts for all types.

03/04/1999  JosephJ Adding custom information to !rm obj, tsk
	Some way to identify a function to call (in user mode) that knows how
	to print custom information about the specific instance.

	> tsk 0x000732C8
	Task 0x000732C8 (TaskO2)
		Hdr:

		Waiting for NdisInitializeAdapter(MP=0x923450900) to complete.

03/04/1999  JosephJ "Verbose" mode for grp
	Currently, only the pointers to the mebers are printed, 4 to a line.
	In verbose mode, switch to one line per member, and allow custom printing
	of member information. Eg (for LocalIP entries):
	0xFE723948 169.240.233.001 RESOLVED

03/04/1999   JosephJ ASSERT_SAME_LOCK_AS_PARENT
	Defined the above macro to assert the case that an object uses the same
	lock as it's parent.


03/04/1999   JosephJ Verifying things aren't changed when an object is unlocked.
	Partial support for is already in the RM api's (the pfnVerifier function stuff).
	We should condider actually using it earlier on the development phase so
	that we catch problems sooner.
	We need to change RM api's (RmLock/UnlockObject) so that they
	compute a checksum on entry and exit -- see earliest entry in this log.
	Basic algorithm:
		RmWriteLockObject(pObj,)
		{
			Lock object
			CurrentState = pfnObjVerifier(pObj, fLock==TRUE);
			ASSERT(CurrentState == pObj->LastSavedState);
		}

		RmUnlockObject(pObj)
		{
			pObj->LastSavedState = pfnObjVerifier(pObj, fLock=FALSE);
			Unlock object.
		}
			

03/04/1999   JosephJ Comments on LocID
	LocID is a 32-bit (typically random) number that identifies a point in the
	source code. I prefer this to saving line/file numbers because:
	1. 32-bit number is easier to carry around.
	2. It's more robust w.r.t. code changes -- simply grep for that number.
	On the downside, you need to make sure that the LocIDs are unique -- easy
	to screq up if you cut and paste code. In unimodem, I has a very elaborate scheme
	that would scan all sources and build a logging C++ file which would only compile
	if the IDs were unique. A simpler script could extract the places where
	these are declared and do a simple check for uniqueness.
	

03/04/1999   JosephJ  Problems with deadlock when using Groups.
	Unfortunately, specifying the RM_LOCKED option could cause deadlock, especially
	the object being looked up does not have its own lock but instead is using
	its parent's lock. Need to find the proper solution to this.


03/04/1999   JosephJ  Size of the context passed in ArpIpQueryInfo.
		Traced this (looking at ip and tcp sources and index1) to
		private\inc\tdiinfo.h (DON'T use tcpipmerge\h\tdiinfo.h, which is for win9x).
		The structure used is TCP_REQUEST_QUERY_INFORMATION_EX.Context, which
		is defined as:
		#define CONTEXT_SIZE                16
		ULONG_PTR     Context[CONTEXT_SIZE/sizeof(ULONG_PTR)];

		So basically we have 4 DWORDS, which is 4ptrs in 32-bit and 2ptrs in
		64-bit.

03/04/1999   JosephJ  Implementing ArpIpQueryInfo.
		We need a mechanism that will deal with our plan to use
		dynamically-resizable hash tables.
		Solution: simply put the IP address in the context.
		We can add an Rm API: RmGetNextObjectInGroupByKey(,...pKey...), which
		will lookup an object that matches pKey and gets the object after it.
		It fails if it doesn't find the object with pKey, or if there is no object
		after the object with the given key, OR if there has been a hash
		table resize. How do we know if there has been a hash table resize? Hmm....
		We may want to add a UINT HashTableGeneration to GROUP, and add the
		Generation to the context.


03/04/1999   JosephJ  Populating the arp cache with static arp entries.
		Good to do this for it's final functionality but also to get
		the bootstrap going.

		For now, just get them from an internally-compiled table.
		Later think about adding them via the standard mechanism.


03/04/1999   JosephJ  Implementing ArpIpQueryInfo (contd...)

		Following are the structures returned. atmarpc.sys (arpif.c) simply
		declared a local char array of sizeof(IFEntry) -- since it's clearly
		the largest. We should probably define a union -- see later down..

		#define MAX_PHYSADDR_SIZE   8

		private\inc\llinfo.h
		typedef struct IPNetToMediaEntry {
			ulong           inme_index;
			ulong           inme_physaddrlen;
			uchar           inme_physaddr[MAX_PHYSADDR_SIZE];
			ulong           inme_addr;
			ulong           inme_type;
		} IPNetToMediaEntry;

		private\inc\ipinfo.h
		typedef struct AddrXlatInfo {
		    ulong       axi_count;
		    ulong       axi_index;
		} AddrXlatInfo;


		private\inc\llinfo.h
		typedef struct IFEntry {
			ulong           if_index;
			ulong           if_type;
			ulong           if_mtu;
			ulong           if_speed;
			ulong           if_physaddrlen;
			uchar           if_physaddr[MAX_PHYSADDR_SIZE];
			ulong           if_adminstatus;
			ulong           if_operstatus;
			ulong           if_lastchange;
			ulong           if_inoctets;
			ulong           if_inucastpkts;
			ulong           if_innucastpkts;
			ulong           if_indiscards;
			ulong           if_inerrors;
			ulong           if_inunknownprotos;
			ulong           if_outoctets;
			ulong           if_outucastpkts;
			ulong           if_outnucastpkts;
			ulong           if_outdiscards;
			ulong           if_outerrors;
			ulong           if_outqlen;
			ulong           if_descrlen;
			uchar           if_descr[1];
		} IFEntry;

		union
		{
			AddrXlatInfo 		AddrInfo;
			IPNetToMediaEntry 	ArpEntry;
			IFEntry		 		Stats;
		} InfoBuf;
		...

		Need to get the adapter info -- stuff in arpGetAdapterInfo, to
		fill out the above structure.

		WIN98: Win98 doesn't like more than 6 chars for IFEntry.if_physaddrlen,
		although it does tolerate more (at-least-7) in AddrXlatInfo.inme_pysaddrlen.

		WIN98 also takes at-leat-7 for LLIPBindInfo.lip_addrlen (IpAddinterfaceRtm)

		NT pIFEntry->if_physaddr <- set to MAC address (6 bytes) + SAP Sel(1 byte)
		W98 pIFEntry->if_physaddr <- set to MAC address (6 bytes, munged due toELAN)
		LLIPBindInfo.lip_addr <- set to ATMAddress starting at ESI offset (7 bytes)
		IPNetToMediaEntry.inme_physaddr <- dest atm addr at ESI offset (y bytes)

		Any reason why pIFEntry->if_physaddr would be different from
		BindInfo->lip_addr?

		MacAddress seems to be used ONLY for pIFEntry.

03/05/1999  JosephJ Thoughts on logging..
	- Log fixed-sized entries (taken from a global list, just like the association
	free-list -- well associations today used alloc's but that'll change).
	- Logs maintained per-object.
	- Log-entry recovery strategy:
		-- all object's log entries deleted when the object is deleted.
		-- If global log entry pool goes empty, then...
			if (the object's log is larger than some threshold)
			{
				we reuse the oldest log entry for that object
			}
			else
			{
				the oldest log entry in the globally-threaded list	
				of log entries entry is reclaimed.
			}
	- KD extensions as well as IOCTLs to display an object' state and logs.

03/05/1999  JosephJ Ideas on using the same code for kd extensions AND IOCTL dump
	Seems possible to use the same code to both collect and dump information in KD
	and from a user mode app that does IOCTLs to the device object representing
	the driver -- after all, conceptually the same thing is going on: there
	is a memory-space transition.

	This is well worth exploring since then once you write an extension, the
	IOCTL support will essentially come for free!

	Unfortunately, we shouldn't allow the user mode app to read arbitrary
	memory from kernel-mode -- so we have to think about this some more.


03/05/1999  JosephJ Strategy for managing ip/1394 encapsulation header buffers
	Keep a fixed-sized, pre-initalized pool of these, and simply queue the packet
	if you run out. More precicely, the send-path would look like:
		Fast path case (vc available for sending, and no pkts queued waiting for
		bufs):
			if (can-back-fill)
			{
				backfill and send
			}
			else
			{
				if (allocate header buf succeeds)
				{
					chain and send
				}
				else
				{
					switch send handler to slow path;
					queue pkt in waiting-for-bufs queue

03/05/1999  More corny locking problems when parent and child share a lock.
	Sometimes we'd like to do the following:
		Lock(pParentObj)
		......
		Create pChildObject
		call Func(pChildObject); // pChildObject's lock released on return from Func

	So RmWriteLock gets called with pParent, and RmUnlock gets called with pChild.
	But RmWrite (extra-checking-version) saves some context of the pParent object,
	so that effectively, it uses the parent's context when freeing the lock;
	So the parent's verifier is called, not the child's.

	This will actually work, but is quite strange behavior which is not at all
	obvious by the call to RmUnlockObject(pChild).

	We'll live with this for now -- see for example the code in 
	ArpIpAddAddress.

	But there is a problem when we implement verification of state preservation
	across locking: Since pChild's verifier function is not called on exit,
	we will assert the NEXT time we try to lock pChild!

	The fix is for RmUnlockObject to call the verifier for pParent(UNLOAD),
	followed by calling verifier for pChild(LOAD), if it detects that
	the object being unlocked is not the same as the object being locked
	(it can do this by looking into the LOCKING_INFO context).

	A bit tricky, but this is fairly clear semantics.

03/05/1999  Locking problems, continued...
	Implemented new function RmDbgChangeLockScope which does the things 
	described above (only if RM_EXTRA_CHECKING is defined, of course).

	Also now RmUnlockObject checks to make sure that the
	RM_LOCKING_INFO.pVerifierContext is a pointer to the object being unlocked.

03/07/1999  JosephJ		Thoughts on location of kdextension sources
	To help things stay in synch, consider keeping a subdir .\kd, which has
	the kd extension code that is sensitive to privately-defined structures.
	This code is actually compiled as part of the debug build of the main component
	-- this will force the code to stay in synch.
	The kd extension dll (which needs to be in another directory)
	would need to includes these files by reaching over into this directory.

03/07/1999  JosephJ		Need to move rm-private state out of Hdr.State

	Since object-specific info is protected by pHdr->pLock, while rm-private state
	is protected by the pHdr->RmPrivateLock,  we can't have both of them use
	pHdr->State; So we need to move rm-private state into its own DWORD.
	This DWORD is dwRmState;

03/07/1999  JosephJ		Registering root objects with RM

	We need to have a mechanism to register root objects with RM, so that multiple
	components (eg. arp1394 and nic1394) can use the RM apis.
	Currently, the primary reason for doing so is to maintain separate global logs
	for each component. Another parameter is the "InterfaceGuid" to uniquely identify
	the component to match up with object-specific information for KD extension
	dumping. More things may need to be added on a per-component basis.

	We have to do some work/re-specification of APIs to allow for a single binary
	that would work for components which have/have-not defined RM_EXTRA_CHECKING.

	typedef struct
	{
		GUID						InterfaceGUID;
	#if		RM_EXTRA_CHECKING
		UINT						NumDbgLogEntries;
		PFN_RM_MEMORY_DEALLOCATOR	pfnDbgLogBufDeallocator;
	#endif // RM_EXTRA_CHECKING
	
	} RM_GLOBAL_INFO, *PRM_GLOBAL_INFO;

	typedef struct
	{
		RM_OBJECT_HEADER 			Hdr;
		PRM_ROOT_INFO    			pRootInfo;
		LIST_ENTRY 					linkRegisteredEntries;

	} RM_ROOT_OBJECT_HEADER;

	
	RmInitializeRootObject(
			IN PRM_ROOT_OBJECT_HEADER,
			PRM_ROOT_INFO    			pRootInfo;
			...
		)
	{
		if (InterlockedCompareExcahnge(RmGlobal_Initialized, 1, 0))
		{
			// Do one-time initialization, including lock and list of 
			// global entries.
		}

		// Add component to global list of registered components.
	}

	
	RmDeinitializeRootObject(
			IN PRM_ROOT_OBJECT_HEADER,
			...,
		)
	{
		//  look for an deinitialize component

		// with global lock held
		if (last-registered-entry)
		{
			// free any globally allocated resources, except of
			// course the global lock itself.
		}
	}

03/07/1999  JosephJ		Thoughts on the obect verifier function...
	
	 To help ensure that no one is READING a piece of data when the object lock
	 is not held, the verifier can reverse the bits of the data on unlocking and
	 flip them back on locking.

03/08/1999 JosephJ		Implemented object logging!
	 Key features:
	 	-- Fixed-sized log entries (RM_DBG_LOG_ENTRY)
	 	-- Each entry has two LIST_ENTRYs: to be a link in the object's list
	 		of log entries and the global list of log entries.
		-- Logging to the object consists of allocating a log entry and inserting
		   it in the head of the object's log list and the global log list.
		-- On deallocation of the object, we free all the entries in object's
		 	log.
		-- Provision to add a buffer to the entry which is freed when the entry
		  is removed from the log -- for cases where the things being logged may
		  go away when the object is still alive.

	Types:
		PFN_DBG_DUMP_LOG_ENTRY 	-- allows customized display of log entries
		RM_DBG_LOG_ENTRY		-- the fixed-size log entry.
	Functions:
		RmDbgLogToObject		-- make an entry in the object's log
		RmDbgPrintObjectLog		-- dump the object log to dbgout
		RmDbgPrintGlobalLog		-- dump the global log to dbgout.


	In order to initialize the global log list, I added the following two RmApis:
	RmInitializeRm		-- call 1st, before any other rm api.
	RmDeinitializeRm	-- call after last rm api, and all async activity complete.

	The above functionality is all implemented and tested via the usermode tests
	in .\tests.

	Note: Once multiple components are using the RM api's, we'll need a more
	sophisticated registration mechanism -- see 07/07/1999  entry "Registering root
	objects with RM"

03/09/1999  JosephJ Consider making init functions fail etc if associated object is
	deallocated.

	We could fail RmInitializeHeader/Task if the parent object is in the deallocated
	state. However,  I'm not sure if it buys us anything -- after all, as soon as
	you return from successful RmInitializeHeader, someone could call
	RmDeallocateObject on the parent, and you get the same result as if the
	parent was already deallocated and we didn't check in RmInitializeHeader.

	What we really want is exact semantics on unloading/deallocating objects.

03/09/1999 	Special allocator for unload-related tasks
	It's ugly for task allocation to fail as part of unloading an object.
	To address this, we should consider special allocation/deallocation for
	unload tasks, that must be called at passive level and will block until
	a free unload-task becomes available.

03/11/1999 RM api enhancements -- more on root objects
	(see 03/07/1999  entry "Registering root objects with RM")
	RootObjects should be an extended hdr structure, with the following info
	-- list of tasks (for debugging only)
	-- "name space GUID", used by kd to load custom information about all the objects
		under the GUID.
	-- Global log (one per root object).
	   
	typedef struct {
		RM_OBJECT_HEADER Hdr;
		LIST_ENTRY	listTasks;
		LIST_ENTRY	listLog;
		...
	} RM_ROOT_OBJECT_HEADER;

03/11/1999 RM api enhancements -- special "unload object" tasks.
	-- Given the similarity of the way shutdown tasks are handled, especially
		the way they deal with existing shutdown tasks, we should consider
		shutdown tasks to be a special kind of tasks with an extended task header
		(below). Also, have a field in all objects to hold THE
		 shutdown task. The RmApis can implement the logic of waiting on THE
		 shutdown task, etc. MOREOVER, it can then support the concept of
		 PARALLEL unload, because it can use the extra fields in the extended
		 shutdown task header to store stuff (LONG to be interlocked-
		 decremented and if zero a task to be un-pended).
	typedef struct
	{
		RM_TASK_HEADER	TskHdr;
		LONG			TasksLeft;			<< interlock-decrement this and if 0 ...
		PRM_TASK		pCoordinatingTask;	<< ... unpend this task.
	} RM_SHUTDOWN_TASK;


	The object's unload task handler will be only called once, regardless of
	howmany times someone requests to unload the object -- this is supported
	by a new Rm API, something like:
		RmUnloadObject(pObj, OPTIONAL pTask,...)  -- if pTask NULL, will block.
	(also the existing RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup)

	Since the handler function will only be called once, it can be simplified --
	the code to deal with existing handler-functions can be taken out.

03/11/1999 RM api enhancements -- stastics gathering(if RM_EXTENDED_CHECKING enabled)
	For the following
		- per root object (global stats)
		- per object
	Stats (current, tot, max)
		- tasks allocated
		- object age (how long it's been around)
		- number of children allocated

	For Groups (current, tot, max)
		-we already maintain some group stats -- rough number of accesses and
		 number links travesed (since it's munged (scaled down), this is not
		 really a true number).
		- Number of adds/deletes/lookups
		- Number of members
		- Links traversed
		- Some idea of how long objects live in the group
			(age can be determined at the time the object is deallocated)
			- best would be a histogram, say of multiples of 16 ms (8 DWORDS)
				<=1ms, <=16ms, <=256ms, <=4s, <=65s(~1m), <=1Ks(16m), <=16Ks(4h), >..
			- quick to compute histogram index: 16-char array L2 of log_2(nibble):
				PUCHAR *puc = (PUCHAR) &val;
				UINT Index =
				(L2[puc[0]]+(L2[puc[1]]<<4)+(L2[puc[2]]<<8)+(L2[puc[3]]<<12))>>2;

		arpInitializeConstBufferPool

	So we have to keep the #if BACK_FILL code.

03/11/1999  JosephJ Ideas on logging enhancements
	- Integrate debug logging with object logging -- single logging model
	  that optionally goes to object log and/or debug log.
	  (So for example a lot of stuff can get logged to the object logs, without
	  choking up the debugger).
	- Verbosity controlled on multiple basis:
		- per-object
		- per stack_record
		- per module
	- Add a SINGLE_LIST_ENTRY to the log entry for stack_record logging -- to be able
	  to dump all log entries made when a particular stack record is in scope.
	  - rather than trying to properly deal with stack_records and/or objects going
	    out  of scope, we simply add the log entry to the HEAD of the stack-record
	    list. This way we don't have to worry if log entries already in the
	    stack-record log are still alive (note we would need to know that if we
	    were using the doubly-linked SLIST_ENTRY).
	  - The kd extension would have to deal with the fact that some of the entries
	    may be deallocatd.
	
03/12/1999 	JosephJ RouteCacheEntry information:
	From:	Joseph Joy  Friday, March 12, 1999 7:43 AM
	Subject:	questions on arp RouteCacheEntry semantics

	NK,
	Are the semantics of RouteCacheEntry passed in to the arp module's lip_transmit
	routine documented anywhere?
	[Nk Srinivas]   Document ???? ;-)
	
	If not, can you answer the following questions? (I need this for my ip/1394 arp
	implementation).
	
	1. From the 1st time we see a particular RCE (with arp context portion all
	 	zeros) until the point the arp modules lip_invalidate handler is called,
		can we assume that the rce will always refer to the same destination IP
		address?
		[Nk Srinivas]  Yes.
	2. Is it possible for the lip_transmit routine to be re-entered for a send with
		the same RCE -- i.e., two or more concurrent calls made to lip_transmit
	 	specifying the same RCE?
		[Nk Srinivas]  yes.
	3. Is #2 is true,  can we assume that the FIRST time a particular RCE is
		specified in lip_transmit, lip_transmit will NOT be reentered with the same
		RCE until the former call to lip_transmit returns? (I hope so).
		[Nk Srinivas]  No. same rce will be passed in every call.
	4. In practice, under moderate to heavy loads, can I assume that the vast
		majority (>99%) of lip_transmit calls are made with a non-NULL RCE?
		[Nk Srinivas] [...] *All* tcp/udp/raw  traffic uses RCE. Only icmp/igmp
		do not use rce.

03/13/1999 	JosephJ New RM APIs RmResumeTaskAsync and RmResumeTaskDelayed
	Added the above two APIs which seem to provide a "big bang for the buck."
	Description:
		RmResumeTaskAsync -- resumes task in the context of a work item
		RmResumeTaskDelayed -- resumes task in the context of a timer handler.

	Potential  uses of RmResumeTaskAsync:

	1.	There is a potential problem with the way that task completion is handled,
		that could lead to excessive use of the stack.

		The specific case where this would happen is if
	 	there are a large number of objects in a group, and
		their shutdown tasks all call SuspendTask and ResumeTask on themselves.
		What will happen is that when RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup is called for
		this group, you will have the shutdown handlers for EACH object in the
		group on the stack (in facta couple of times each).

		To avoid this pathalogical situation (which except for its use of the 
		stack is otherwise perfectly correct), RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup can
		unload each object as a separate work item.

	2.	If a task wants to do something at passive level and it can be sure
		that it is currently at passive level.

	Potential uses of RmResumeTaskDelayed:
	1.	For debugging, to delay completion of some operation makes it extremely
		easy to do it).
	2.	If a task needs to do something after a fixed period of time -- say to
		send a retry after 3 seconds.

03/13/1999 	JosephJ 	Ageing of objects
	The use of ageing timers can be completely hidden from the user if objects
	have ages and they WILL be unloaded (it's shutdown task will be started) if
	the age expires. The rm API RmResetAgeingTimer is used to extend the object's
	life.

	Support for ageing of objects, plus the RmResumeTaskDelayed api described 
	above, should pretty-much obviate the user's need for explicit timers.

03/14/1999  JosephJ	Finished implementing RmResumeTaskAsync and RmResumeTaskDelayed
	Finished implementing and testing (in user mode) the above two functions
	(see 03/13/1999 entry "New RM APIs RmResumeTaskAsync and RmResumeTaskDelayed").
	To test in user mode, I wrote user-mode versions of the following Ndis APIs:
		NdisInitializeWorkItem
		NdisScheduleWorkItem
		NdisInitializeTimer

	The following are used for references to external objects, such as RCEs and
	packets:
		RmLinkToExternalFast		Addrefs object
		RmLinkToExternalEx			Debug versions of the above, adds an association
		RmUnlinkFromExternalFast	Delrefs object
		RmUnlinkFromExternalEx		Debug version of the above, dels an association
	TODO: need to make the fast versions inline, and also currently 
	RmUnlinkFromExternalEx declares a stack-record -- it should do this only
	if the object needs to actually be deallocated (i.e call another function
	 which declares a stack log)

03/19/1999  JosephJ Thoughts on cleaning up the task handlers
	- Separate PendCompletion-, End- and Abort-handlers.
	- No "UserParam", even on starting -- instead, just NDIS_STATUS.
	- User is expected to setup the task with any required initialization parameters
	  *before* calling RmStartTask.
	- "START" is a special pend code value of (ULONG)-1, sent to the task's
	  PendCompletion handler.
	- RmStartTask has return type VOID.
	- PendCompletion and Abort handlers have return type VOID.
	- Only the End handler returns NDIS_STATUS (anything besides PENDING).
	  (This return status is passed on any tasks that may be pending on it).

	The PendCompletion handler prototype becomes...
		typedef
		VOID
		(*PFN_RM_TASK_PENDCOMPLETE_HANDLER)(
			IN	struct _RM_TASK	*			pTask,
			IN	OS_STATUS					Status,
			IN	PRM_STACK_RECORD			pSR
			);

	RmStartTask's prototype becomes...
		VOID
		RmStartTask(
			IN	PRM_TASK					pTask,
			IN	PRM_STACK_RECORD			pSR
		);

03/22/1999 	JosephJ Support for retail debugging or RM objects
	- May want to consider adding links to children and peers (4 ptrs overhead!)
	  purely for debugging purposes. At least make it a compile option independent
	  of DBG
	- Support the following RM dbgextension:
		!rm scantree <obj addr>	<pattern>
			-- scans the obj at addr <obj addr> and all its children for 
				pattern <pattern>
		!rm tree <obj addr>
			-- lists the entire tree of objects, starting at oject <obj addr>

	bp atmarpc!DbgMark "dd (esp+4) l1; g poi(esp)"

03/23/1999  JosephJ Media-specific parameters is 5 DWORDs from base ....
			but NIC1394_MEDIA_PARAMETERS, whose 1st field is a union
			which includes a UINT64, needs to be 8-byte aligned!
			Fix? Probably redefine the UniqueID to be UniqueIDHi and UniqueIDLo

03/24/1999  JosephJ Wierdness involving MIB processing in ip.c
	Previously, the arp module could be net-stopped and started, but then
	arp, ipconfig, etc wouldn't work, and what was happening is the the reloaded
	arp module was being given the OLD entity instance values (from its previous
	life). I found that sometime after we initiate unload by calling IP's
	pDelInterfaceRtn, Ip calls  ArpIpGetEList. At this stage (i.e. we are closing),
	we need to set the pAT/IFEntity->tei_instance to  INVALID_ENTITY_INSTANCE to
	fix this problem.

03/24/1999 	JosephJ 		Adding to fake Ndis calls:
	Adding more variations to the fake versions of the following Ndis calls:
		NdisClMakeCall
		NdisClCloseCall
		NdisCoSendPackets
	We need to randomly chose among the following variations:
	- failure OR success
	- async OR sync completion for make/close call
	- async OR sync (i.e. while NdisCoSendPackets still on stack) completion for
	  SendPkts.
	- For async completion of make/close call and async completion of sendpkts,
	  to call the completion call back in dpc OR passive level.
	- For async calls, delay for some random amount of time.

03/25/1999 JosephJ	Implemented all of the above fake ndis call variations!
	Check out fake.c -- it now has a pretty elaborate mechanism for controlling
	the probabilities of the variations of behaviour of the fake versions of
	NdisClMakeCall, NdisClCloseCall and NdisCoSendPackets -- basically it allows
	you to specify weights of the above variations (failure/success, async/sync
	etc) and then generates samples based on those weights. Here's an example
	of how the delay amount is specified:
		static
		OUTCOME_PROBABILITY
		DelayMsOutcomes[] = 
		{
			{0,			5},		// Delay 0ms, etc...
			{10,		5},
			{100,		5},
			{1000,		1},
			{10000,		1}
		};
	The above means that 0,10, and 100ms delays each have a weight of 5 and
	1000ms and 10000ms each have a weight of 1.

	TODO: May want to add jitter to the outcome values, where they make sense.
	It's easy to do that -- for example Val += (R*Val/32), where R is a random
	signed integer in the range of -8 to 8 (need to watch for overflow and 
	boundary conditions). Anyway, I don't think this will add anything tangible
	(i.e. find bugs that would not have otherwise been found).

	The code to generate samples based on weights, and the fake versions of the
	calls themselves, were first tested in user mode via the tests in
	tests\tarp.c (test functions  test_ArpGenRandomInt() and test_arpDbgFakeCalls().)
	test_ArpGenRandomInt actually prints out results to show that the actual
	percentages  match the specified weights. Here is some sample
	output(pretty good results!):
			NUM_TRIALS = 100....
				Outcome=0x0; True%=0.032258; Computed%=0.020000
				Outcome=0x1; True%=0.064516; Computed%=0.050000
				Outcome=0x2; True%=0.129032; Computed%=0.170000
				Outcome=0x3; True%=0.258065; Computed%=0.240000
				Outcome=0x4; True%=0.516129; Computed%=0.520000
			...
			NUM_TRIALS = 10000....
				Outcome=0x0; True%=0.032258; Computed%=0.034800
				Outcome=0x1; True%=0.064516; Computed%=0.063300
				Outcome=0x2; True%=0.129032; Computed%=0.126400
				Outcome=0x3; True%=0.258065; Computed%=0.256800
				Outcome=0x4; True%=0.516129; Computed%=0.518700
	The core random number generator is based on Numerical Recipes ran1() --
	see fake.c for details.

	Today I used the above fake version of the APIs to test arp1394 -- it worked
	fine for basic pings, but arp1394 has just hit an assert when I tried
	"net start atmarpc" while pings were ongoing. So the test infrastructure is
	bearing fruit!

	The great thing about these fake versions is that I can continue to use them
	in the future for regression testing of arp1394.

03/25/1999  JosephJ Ahem...above-mentioned assert is due to be a bug in fake.c

03/25/1999 	JosephJ IPDelInterface should be called at PASSIVE!

	Check out the following stack trace. The bugcheck happened because
	IPDelInterface was called at DPR level (our good-old fake close-call completion
	callback did this, by design). So obviously we must switch to passive before
	calling IPDelInterface. But this stack is an example of the potential
	problem I mentioned in the  03/13/1999 note
	"New RM APIs RmResumeTaskAsync and RmResumeTaskDelayed":
			1.	There is a potential problem with the way that task completion
				is handled, that could lead to excessive use of the stack.
	So basically we need to figure out key points to do a "resume task asynch."
	I could make "RmCancelPendOnOtherTask" do a RmResumeTaskAsync instead
	of RmResumeTask EXCEPT that we need a work item to do this.

03/26/1999  JosephJ Some proposed modifications to RM task handling ...
	- RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup causes the cascaded chain of start tasks above
	  if the unload task of each object returns synchronously or asynchronously
	  but with the original start task still on the stack. This has to change.
		A One fix is for RmUnloadAllObjectsInGroup to call an unload *function*
		  (instead of starting a task) for each object. This unload function would
		  take the unload-all-objects task as an argument and if
		  necessary start a task and make the coordinating task pend on it. If this
		  function returns synchronously, however, then the unload-all-objects task
		  can go on to the next task.
		B Another fix is to make RmPendTaskOnOtherTask return PENDING if the
		  task has been pended or SUCCESS if OtherTask has already completed.
		  Currently, typical sequence of starting and pending on another task is:
		  		pOtherTask = AllocTask(...);
		  		RmPendOnOtherTask(pTask, pOtherTask,...);
		  		RmStartTask(pOtherTask,...);
		  With the proposed change, the sequence becomes...
		  		pOtherTask = AllocTask(...);
		  		RmTmpReferenceObject(&pOtherTask.Hdr,...);
		  		RmStartTask(pOtherTask,...);
		  		Status = RmPendTaskOnOtherTask(pTask, pOtherTask, ...);
		  		RmTmpDereferenceObject(&pOtherTask.Hdr,...);
		  		if (PEND(Status))
		  		{
		  			// we're pending on the other task.
		  			...
		  		}
		  		else
		  		{
		  			// Other task is complete. Go on to the next step.
		  			//
		  		}
		 For now, we can use an StartAndTryPend internal api used only
		 by the unload-all-objects task so we don't have to go and change things
		 everywhere.

		 Implemented option 'B', but specifically for use by  rmTaskUnloadGroup.
		 The new version of the pend function is called RmPendTaskOnOtherTaskV2
		 (called only by rmTaskUnloadGroup).

03/26/1999  JosephJ Was a bug in my code to switch to async before calling DelIF...
	Following is an example of using dumps of object associations and logs to
	quickly find out what's going on and where the problem is....

	The net stop was hanging, but the system was otherwise available. So I broke

	Note the 2486 log entries above!
	So basically what's happening is that the IF shutdown task was in an
	endless loop of switching to async -- this was because it was
	checking whether it was at PASSIVE wit the IF lock held!

	Moved & modified  makefile and sources down to w2k and also win98.

03/28/1999 	JosephJ ARP packet handling (contd...)
	Implemented arpParseArpPkt and arpPrepareArpPkt (in arp.c)

03/28/1999 	JosephJ Thoughts on cleaning up RmLookupObjectInGroup
	RmLookupObjectInGroup is too overloaded -- split it up into a LookupOrCreate
	function and a pure Lookup function. Or maybe use macros...

03/29/1999 	JosephJ	max_rec and sspd info in ARP pkts...
	We should request that sspd info be removed from the ARP pkt.
	Anyway, I've sent mail to georgioc asking how to get this information for the
	local host.

03/30/1999 	JosephJ	Yet another way to handle failures in the task handler....
			From  arpTaskInitializeInterface(...):
						// Couldn't allocate task. Let's do a fake completion of
						// this stage...
						//
						UNLOCKOBJ(pIF, pSR);
						RmSuspendTask(pTask, PEND_SetupReceiveVc, pSR);
						RmResumeTask(pTask, (UINT_PTR) Status, pSR);

03/30/1999 	JosephJ	Thougts on using tasks to help write pageable code

	Support for "pageable" tasks -- the rm api's can make
	sure that the context is passive (switching to passive if
	required) whenever the handler is called.
	We can require only the START and (optional) complete handlers
	to be nonpaged. Even the START handler doesn't need to be
	pageable -- if we require that RmStartTask be called at
	PASSIVE.

	I think this is a pretty cool concept and should be explored further.

03/31/1999 	JosephJ	Static ping works!
	Today, we got ping and ttcp to work across two machines, over ip/1394!
	Throughput was dismal -- ~ 250K bytes/sec (2M bits/sec), but otherwise
	it's stable (pinged all night, continues to ping...), provided you don't
	try to yank the cable etc in the middle. ADube is working on nic1394 to fix
	the latter problems.

	Great thing is that ABSOLUTELY NO FIXES were required in atmarpc.sys to get
	this to work (I just compiled atmarpc.sys with the option to use the real
	make/close call and send pkt apis.).

04/02/1999 	JosephJ RM logging contd...
	Add another SLIST_ENTRY for threading together all log entries generated during
	a particular stack trace. The stack record would contain the list head.

	Consider putting refcounts on each log entry.

04/07/1999 	JosephJ fake api's caught case where we could be calling add if at DPC
	The fake recv makecall completed at DPC level,and this caused a bugcheck when
	we called IP's add IF routine. Fixed this by switching to passive if required,
	before calling IP's add IF routine.

04/07/1999 	JosephJ verified that this is 64-bit clean (checked and fre)

04/07/1999 	JosephJ Added arp1394 and arp13kd sources to the tcpipmerge project.
	Did this today.

04/08/1999 	JosephJ added tmp ref in RmResumeTask
	RmResumeTask now tmpref task before calling pfnHandler so that it can be
	sure pTask is around on return from pfnHandler. Actually hit this situation today
	(and bugchecked) on the mp machine during "net stop", when using the fake
	ndis apis (with delayed completions.). Had never this this before, though the
	bug has been around. Chalk up another win to the fake apis (see 04/07/199 
	entry "fake api's caught...").

04/19/1999  JosephJ Proposed new general format for unloadobject:

	Eventually we'll move all unloads to conform to this format, and change
	RmUnloadAllObjects in group to use this mechanism....

		)
	/*++
	
	Routine Description:

		Initiate the asynchronous unload of pIF. If pIF is currently being loaded
		(initialized), abort the initializeation or wait for it to complete before
		unloading it. If pIF is currently being unloaded and pCallingTask is 
		NULL, return right away, else (pCallingTask is not NULL),
		suspend pCallingTask and make it pend until the unload completes.
	
		NO locks must be held on entrance and none are held on exit.

	Arguments:

		pIF				- Interface to unload.
		pCallingTask	- Optional task to suspend if unload is completing async.
		SuspendCode		- SuspendCode for the above task.

	Return Value:

		NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS	-- on synchronous success OR pCallingTask==NULL
		NDIS_STATUS_PENDING	-- if pCallingTask is made to pend until the operation
   							completes.

04/20/1999  JosephJ Do we have a "pPrimaryTask" for  an object.
	Consider ARP1394_INTERFACE.
	We could have 3 pointers: pLoadTask,pUnloadTask, and pReinitTask, or
	we could have a single pointer: pPrimaryTask.
	
	New\Current		Loading				Reiniting			Unloading
	
	Loading			INVALID				INVALID				INVALID
	
	Reiniting		wait				wait,then quit		quit or wait, then quit
	
	Unloading		wait				wait				wait

	From the above matrix, we see that in all cases if an incoming task sees that
	there is an existing task, it can basically wait for it to complete before
	going on to the next stage. It is simpler to do this if there is only
	one "existing task" to wait for -- the pPrimaryTask.

	Common code for the task handlers:

	case START:
		 // FALL THROUGH

	case PEND_ExistingPrimaryTaskComplete:
		LOCKOBJ(pIF, pSR);
		if (pIF->pPrimaryTask!=NULL)
		{
			PRM_TASK pPrimaryTask = pIF->pPrimaryTask;
			tmpRef(pIF->pPrimaryTask,pSR);
			UNLOCKOBJ(pIF,pSR);
			RmPendTaskOnOtherTask(
				pTask,
				PEND_ExistingPrimaryTaskComplete,
				pPrimaryTask,
				pSR
				);
			Status = NDIS_STATUS_PENDING;
			break;
		}

		//
		// There is no primary task currently -- make pTask the primary task.
		//
		arpSetPrimaryIfTask(pIF, pTask, pSR);


		.... start doing stuff ...


04/20/1999  JosephJ Dbg associations: consider adding a payload
	Maybe replace entity 2 by "payload" -- like szFormat, it's not used in
	distinguishing different associations. This is useful if you want to make
	sure that there is only one kind of a particular association, but still save
	the payload as part of the association.


04/20/1999  JosephJ Note on RM "philosophy"
	- High-level logical concepts should have real data structures associated
	  with them -- eg "reconfiguring", "initializing"  use tasks.

	- Try to keep code associated with a single logical operation together

04/21/1999  JosephJ	Life of objects contd...

	States: INITING INITED REINITING DEINITING DEINITED

	Actions:
	 Create		-- synchronous, leaves state in INITING stage.
	 Bind   	-- object is now visible
	 Initialize -- async initialization
	 Reinit		-- async re-initialization
	 Deinit		-- async de-initialization
	 			   deleted.
	 Delete		-- inverse of Create, except that object is only actually freed
				   when the refcount goes to zero..

	Sub states: ACTIVE,DEACTIVATING,ACTIVATING, DEACTIVATED
	Sub actions:
	Activate -- async activation
	Deactivate -- async deactivation

04/23/1999  JosephJ arpTaskUnloadRemoteIp <-> arpTaskSendPktsOnRemoteIp interaction
	arpTaskUnloadRemoteIp checks only on starting if there is a send-task bound
	to pRemoteIp -- it relies on the fact that once the unload task is
	bound, no NEW pSendTask will bind to pRemoteIp. The sendpkts task thus
	needs to check whether there is a pUnloadTask bound and if so not bind
	itself. This fix was added today -- I hit it during stress. There may be
	analogous bugs hiding elsewhere.

	We should consider how to make these things "automatic" -- somehow the
	unload task waits for all tasks started before unload to finish,
	and all non-unload-related tasks automatically fail if unload is in progress.

04/25/1999  JosephJ More Task Stats 
	 -- count of number of times a task's handler is called

04/30/1999 	JosephJ	Bug in the way we read adapter config.
	Basically, immediately after our call to NdisOpenAdapter completes, we may
	get a call to our  ArpCoAfRegisterNotify. The latter can't assume that
	the task that issued NdisOpenAdapter is in fact completed, and on MP machines,
	in fact it sometimes doesn't complete.

	So what to do? Currently we fix this by pending on the adapter bind task if
	it is in fact arpTaskInitializeAdapter. A bit hacky...

04/30/1999 	JosephJ	Bug in the way we handle RmResumeTask and perhaps others..
	We can't rely on the state of the task after calling the handler function,
	because the lock is released in between.

05/18/1999  JosephJ Stats gathering.

Potential apis to use:

	NdisGetCurrentSystemTime returns the current system time, suitable for setting
	timestamps. 

	KeQueryPerformanceCounter provides the finest grained running count available
	in the system. KeQueryPerformanceCounter is intended for time stamping packets
	or for computing performance and capacity measurements. It is not intended for
	measuring elapsed time, for computing stalls or waits, or for iterations.
	
	Use this routine sparingly, calling it as infrequently as possible. Depending
	on the platform, KeQueryPerformanceCounter can disable system-wide interrupts
	for a minimal interval. Consequently, calling this routine frequently or
	repeatedly, as in an iteration, defeats its purpose of returning very
	fine-grained, running time-stamp information. Calling this routine too
	frequently can degrade I/O performance for the calling driver and for the
	system as a whole.
	
	Implementation:

	pIf->stats.StatsResetTime;		// Set by a call to NdisGetCurrentSystemTime.
	
	Sends:
	Pkt.WrapperReservedEx[sizeof(PVOID)] -- used for storing 4-byte timestamp.

	Tasks:
	Add LONGLONG timestamp field for tasks; Stats actually maintained within rm.
	(Later to be moved into root object header).

06/03/1999 	Broadcast channel support in ARP1394.

	Arp1394 needs to make a call specifying special-channel number
	"NIC1394_BROADCAST_CHANNEL". It must not specify the 
	NIC1394_VCFLAG_ALLOCATE flag.

	The broadcast channel is a virtual channel maintained by the miniport for
	broadcast. The miniport deals with the details of the BCM and the re-allocating
	of the channel after a bus reset.

	Arp1394 tries just once, during interface activation, to make a call to
	the broadcast channel. It does not fail initialization if the call fails.
	If we get an incoming close on this channel, arp1394 does not try to
	re-make the call.

	TODO: need to add eventlog entries for serious errors
	like these.
	TODO: perhaps keep an internal log of serious errors like these, which our
	utility can dump (eventually move to WMI).

	The make-call to the channel is made by the interface-activation task
	(arpTaskActivateInterface) and closed by the interface-deactivation task
	(arpTaskDeactivateInterface).

06/03/1999 	Address resolution protocol implementation
	We start an address-resolution (AR) task for each remote-ip that needs address
	resolution. pRemoteIp->pResolutionTask points to the  official AR task.

	The AR's task is responsible for creating and linking a pDest to the remote IP.
	Note that there may be many tasks (each associated with different remote-ip
	objects) running concurrently, each of which resolve to the same pDest.

	The AR task goes through the following steps:

	- prepare and send an arp request
	  -- resume-task delayed
	[if we get a response that corresponds to this remote-IP,
	 we setup the linkage to the pDest and cancel the delayed resume-task]
	 -- if resume-task-delayed resumes normally (this is a timeout), we
	   repeat the process 3 times, then fail.

06/08/1999 	Broadcast channel implementation plan.
	1. Implement and test bc channel setup/teardown using fake makecalls.
	2. Implement and test 1st phase of arp resolution (sending out 3 requests)
		by using fake send packets on the broadcast channel.
	3. Implement the remaining phases of arp resolution -- processing received
		responses and requests.
	4. Perhaps test this by adding to ioctl utility ability to simulate received
	   packets.

06/23/1999  Dealing with different kinds of VCs.

	We need a common VC header.

	typedef struct
	{
		PCHAR							Description;
		CO_SEND_COMPLETE_HANDLER		CoSendCompleteHandler;
		CO_STATUS_HANDLER				CoStatusHandler;
		CO_RECEIVE_PACKET_HANDLER		CoReceivePacketHandler;
		CO_AF_REGISTER_NOTIFY_HANDLER	CoAfRegisterNotifyHandler;


		CL_MAKE_CALL_COMPLETE_HANDLER	ClMakeCallCompleteHandler;
		CL_CLOSE_CALL_COMPLETE_HANDLER	ClCloseCallCompleteHandler;
		CL_INCOMING_CLOSE_CALL_HANDLER	ClIncomingCloseCallHandler;
		
	} ARP_STATIC_VC_INFO;

	typedef struct
	{
		ARP_STATIC_VC_INFO pStaticInfo;
		UINT	

	} ARP_VC_HEADER;

06/24/1999 Implementing timeouts
	We have RmResumeTaskDelayed, which uses NdisSetTimer;
	We need something like RmResumeDelayedTaskNow which cancels the timer and if
	the timer has not fired, resumes the task with an appropriate status.

	Since responses to arp requests may come at random times or not at all,
	the task should not have a stage which completes when the response is received;
	or rather it should not be explicitly completing whenever a response is
	received. Instead, if a response is received, the following should happen:
		- Update the information in the destination object, setting the state to
		  be resolved.
		- If a task is running, abort it
	The task does the following (asynchronously)
		while (state != resolved &&  (number of tries not exceeded))
		{
			send arp request packet;
			wait retry-delay << this wait will be aborted if an arp response
							 << is received.
		}

	This deals with receiveing delayed or unsolicited arp responses while in the
	middle of address resolution.

06/24/1999  A note on refcounts for timeouts:
	We need to make sure that in all cases, the task is around when the timer fires.
	This needs to happen even when RmResumeDelayedTaskNow is called.

	RmResumeDelayedTask should do the following:
		if (CancelTimer succeeds)
		{
			Call resume task handler
		}
		else
		{
			do nothing.
		}

	So I don't think any explicit ref counting need be done for the tasks after all!
	
06/24/1999  Dealing with broadcast/multicast addresses which may map to either
	the broadcast channel or a mcap-allocated channel.

	One idea is to implement the broadcast channel as a destination object.
	This is a good idea, because then a lot of things will fall through.
	We do need to actually establish the call, but this can be done implicitly when
	we send our unsolicited arp response when the first add-ip arrives.
	
06/28/1999 

	To implement the above scheme, we also need to do the arp-registration work,
	and rip out the code we're written to maintain the explicit broadcast channel
	(stuff in pIF->bccinfo).

	ArpCoSendComplete -- needs to look at vctype and/or packets to decide what
	to do for the broadcast channel case.

	
07/01/1999 JosephJ	Broadcast/Multicast "address resolution"
	To maximize shared code, we treat broadcast and multicast sends similarly
	to unicast sends, except that we automatically resolve them to the broadcast
	channel in stead of sending out an ARP request for them.

	So the first time we are asked to send to non-unicast address A, we go down
	the slow send path, create a remote-IP object for it, link it to the broadcast
	channel destination destination object, and go from there.

	We DO need to know if this is a non-unicast address, but we only check this
	if there is NO linkage to a destination object -- which will happen only on
	the FIRST packet sent to that particular ip address. Subsequent packets will
	go through the medium send path (look up remoteIP, send on the VC associated
	with the destination object).

	The test for whether an address is non-unicast is not trivial, and is borrowed
	from the atmarpc code -- basically it needs to check for classD,
	all-1's, subnet-broadcast (based on the subnet-masks of all the local
	IP adresses registered), and network broadcast (based on the break up of address
	space into classes.)


	Following is an example of the list of local IP addresses registered 
	0: kd> dd 0x80872628+0x4c l3
	80872674  00000002 ffffffff 00000000	<<< all 1's
	0: kd> dd 0x80856828+0x4c l3			
	80856874  00000000 bbfdfea9 0000ffff	<<< local IP, subnet mask 0xffff
	0: kd> dd 0x80857128+0x4c l3
	80857174  00000001 010000e0 00000000	<<< class D address 224.0.0.1

	NOTE: According to Amritansh, the stack could also be run in "BSD mode", where
	all-ZEROs represents the broadcast address -- even in the host-id portion
	for directed broadcasts. This is why the broadcast address is passed in
	as a  "Add local address."

07/02/1999  Support for enumerating all objects in a group.
	Currently this is required in 4 places:
		1. ioctl.c -- looking for a specific interface
		2. ioctl.c -- looking for a unicast local-ip object
		3. ioctl.c -- reporting the arp table.
		4. ip.c    -- reporting the arp table.
		5. ip.c	   -- determining if an ip address is non-unicast.

	It would be good for the rm api's to support enumeration through all items
	in a group.

	PVOID
	RmEnumerateObjectsInGroup(
		pGroup,
		pfnFunction,
		pvContext,
		pSR
		);

	Enumeration continues until the enumerator function returns false.
	typedef
 	INT
	(*PFN_RM_GROUP_ENUMERATOR) (
			PRM_OBJECT_HEADER	pHdr,
			PVOID			  	pvContext,

07/09/1999  ResumeDelayedTaskNow semantics and problems.
	Is it possible for someone to call ResumeDelayedTaskNow and have it resume

07/13/1999  Lookaside lists for protocol data.
	We could use lookaside lists (NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList) for protocol
	packet data, but we choose to use
	NdisAllocateMemoryWithTag, because we don't expect to be using a lot of these
	packets.

07/13/1999  General thoughts on fault insertion.
	Either the implementation of APIs themselves should have a mechanism for fault
	insertion, or there should be a machanism to add a shim that inserts faults.
	Either way, it would catch many many bugs that would otherwise go undetected.

07/13/1999  protocol context for ARP pkts:
	We use the PCCommon structure defined in ip.h even for ARP packets. This
	is also done in the ATM arp module (atmarpc.sys). sizeof(struct PCCommon)

	The only field we actually USE however, is PCCommon.pc_owner, to distinguish
	it from IP pkts on send completion.

07/14/1999 Making sure we properly abort the resolution task.
	pResolutionTask needs to have to variables:
		fAbort
		fTimerInitialized

	if (fTimerInitialized, it's ok to called cancel timer)
	if (fAbort, then the task won't do a resume).

	Never mind. This is best handled WITHIN the RM API's, by appropriate use
	of internal.
	The semantics of ResumeDelayedTaskNow are as follows:
	 It will cause the abort of the task if it's currently delay-suspended OR. If it
	 is NOT suspended, it will cause an immediate abort the NEXT time it is
	 suspended. After the abort, the state is cleared so it will not cause the abort
	 of a subsequent suspension.

	 (in AtmArpPnPReconfigHandler, a config-string is passed in).
	 Gets it's value from the registry (arpcfg.c, AtmArpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration).
	 This is not W98 specific.

	AtmArpCfgOpenLISConfiguration uses it to get the configuration name before
	opening the registry.

In summary there are THREE strings:
	pAdapter->ConfigString   <- passed in adapter bind handler SS1 (W98 only:
									converted from ANSI to unicode).
							<- used in reg af-handler to read registry.
	(pAdapter->bind.ConfigName)

	pAdapter->IPConfigString <- read from registry as unicode
							<- used to create an IF (or multiple for ipatmc).
	(pAdapter->bind.IpConfigString)

	pInterface->IPConfigString <- constructed from pAdapter->IPConfigString.
								 (W98: converted to ANSI before calling IP's
								 add-IF rtn.)
	(pIF->ip.ConfigString)


07/22/1999  JosephJ Ryan Schoff got atmarpc.sys (aka arp1394.sys) loaded under win98.
	We hit a breakpoint in NDIS.SYS complaining about the NULL SendCompleteHandler.
	I had set some handlers to NULL because they would never be used, and W2K NDIS
	is happy with that but NDIS is not.

07/26/1999  JosephJ A-DavHar hit a bug in arp1394 during stress where we had
   launched the recv-fifo cleanup task while a make-call task was ongoing. Fixed
   the recv-fifo task to wait for the makecall task to complete before doing its 
   thing. TODO: Need to do this for the other kinds of VCs as well (
   broadcast and send-fifo VCs).

08/03/1999  JosephJ	We hit the following assert:
	A13: rmVerifyObjectState:FATAL: Object 0xFF8D4828 modified without lock held!
	A13: rmVerifyObjectState:To skip this assert, type "ed 0xFF8D1B74 1; g"
	A13: !ASSERT( !"Object was modified without lock held!" ) C:0xFF8D4828 L:4830, rm.c

	This is because pRemoteIp's state was modified without RmLockObject(pRemoteIp)
	being called on it (it's safe because we had pIF's lock at that time, and pRemoteIp
	shares the lock with pIF). The bug is that we're not calling 
	RmDbgChangeLockScope before/after change pRemoteIp's state.

	Hit this again -- this time -- same cause. Temporarily disabled assert. TODO: need
	to cleanup the code by adding changelockscope.


08/19/1999  JosephJ 
	Added code in n134cfg.c to initialize and dump the config rom unit directory
	for 1394 net devices. Used code from wdk\1394\bus\buspnp.c


08/23/1999  JosephJ Got arp1394.sys to load in Windows Millennium, build 23459...
	This is with modified mstcp.dll and nettrans.inf that recognize the new
	nic upper binding "ndis1394".
	But arp1394.sys is s failing initialization because 
	arpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration is failing, which we would expect to ALWAYS
	fail (even on w2k) because it's looking for subkey ATMARPC, which doesn't exist.
	Perhaps it's because  arpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration calls
	NdisOpenConfigurationKeyByName which on w2k returns success
	 (but sets *pInterfaceConfigHandle to NULL) if the key doesn't exist.
	It so happens that arpGetInterfaceConfiguration, which calls
	arpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration, *can* deal with this somewhat indirect
	failure mechanism without returning failure, but if
	arpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration *were* to return failure, it returns failure.

	I'm going to change arpGetInterfaceConfiguration so that it ignores
	arpCfgReadAdapterConfiguration returning failure.


08/24/1999  JosephJ Arp1394.sys now loads and works (ping works) on Millennium.

09/16/1999 JosephJ Alternative to  RmDbgChangeLockScope
	See  "08/03/1999  JosephJ	We hit the following assert:" entry.
	Instead of RmDbgChangeLockScope, we should add "RmDbgFakeLockObject"
	and "RmDbgFakeUnlockObject" -- these functions just run the verification
	code but do not actually lock/unlock the object. They *do* verify that the
	object is indeed locked.

09/17/1999  JosephJ  Win98/Millennium Netconfig: IPConfig value under ndi\interface.
	This is Win98/Millennium  specific.
	pIF->ip.ConfigString is an ANSI value. It is created by reading the "IPConfig"
	value under the interface's key. With proposed changes to elminiate having to
	change mstcp.dll, "IPConfig" will no longer be created. It so happens that
	the value of IPConfig is the same as the interface key (which is passed into
	System).

09/17/1999   JosephJ [Version 2] Support for retail debugging or RM objects
	[ See 03/22/1999 note with the same title]

	For now, we're going to add 4 ptrs to EVERY object. We can back off from
	this strategy later. This is PURELY for retail-mode debugging purposes.
	- Support the following RM dbgextension:
		!rm scantree <obj addr>	<pattern>
			-- scans the obj at addr <obj addr> and all its children for 
				pattern <pattern>
		!rm tree <obj addr>
			-- lists the entire tree of objects, starting at oject <obj addr>
Mon 09/27/1999  JosephJ !tree implemented

	Real output:

Tue 09/28/1999  JosephJ Millennium llipif.h
	We keep a win9x copy of llipif.h checked under w98\llipif.h.
	I did a windiff against the llipif.h in \\muroc\slm
	(\\muroc\slmro2\proj\net\vxd\src\tcpip\h\llipif.h)
	I found that the muroc version had one field extra in the LLIPBindInfo struct:
	---------- TDI\TCPIPMERGE\1394\ARP1394\W98\llipif.h next ----------
	294a295
	>    uint      lip_pnpcap;         //initial pnp capability flags.
	This is a set of flags used to determine Wakeuponlan capability.
	
Wed 09/29/1999  JosephJ Millennium tdiinfo.h
	MAX_TDI_ENTITIES 32(mill) 4096(w2k)
	INVALID_ENTITY_INSTANCE -1 (w2k) (not defined in mill). We don't use it either.
	

	ArpIpGetEList appears to be the same as the Win9x version.

	Fixed the problem
	Basically the bug is that we were not checking entity value and type
	for Win98 -- I copied that behavior from atmarpc, but it was in fact
	not compiled in in atmarpc, because DBG_QRY WAS defined for win98 (see
	arpif.c  AtmArpIfQueryInfo).

	BUGBG: need to look at the return value of AtmArpCopyToNdisBuffer -- the
	code the checks this was added RECENTLY to atmarpc.sys -- after I created
	the sources for arp1394. Apparantly we could hit this in low mem situations.

Mon 10/18/1999  JosephJ Bringing down the IF when the media is "disconnected"

 	-----Original Message-----
 	From: 	Joseph Joy (Exchange)  
 	So you trigger add/del based on NDIS_STATUS_WAN_LINE_UP/DOWN?
  	-----Original Message-----
  	From: 	Amritansh Raghav (Exchange)  
  	actually i do use IPAddInterface an IPDelInterface to do this
  	remember that this can only be done at PASSIVE so NdisStatus may not be the
	place to do it (of course i got this to work by asking jameel to provide a hack
	whereby he doesnt  raise the irql for the lineup status indication)
   	-----Original Message-----
   	From: 	Joseph Joy (Exchange)  
   	Hi Amritansh,
   	I'd like to dynamically make the IP interface associated with a 1394 adapter
	appear and disappear based on whether there are any other ip/1394 capable
	devices attached.
   	The local ndis1394 miniport itself stays enabled regardless of whether there
	are remote nodes or not. So I'd like to trigger the appearance/disappearance
	based on some status indication.
   	I'd like ipconfig to not list the interface at all (not just list it as
	"disconnected") if there are no remote nodes active.
   	Looks like you have a solution for wan devices -- the interface is only
	listed via ipconfig if there is an active wan connection. How is this done?
	Arvind tells me that wanarp doesn't call IPDelInterface.
	
	We've decided to trigger off "disconnected" status.
	On register notify: check if status is disconnected.
	If disconnected: don't init interface, else: init interface.

	On connect notification: if IF is going away -- queue task to re-
	start based on registry config (unless adapter going away).

	On disconnect notification: start delayed task to get rid of adapter.

Mon 10/18/1999 Registering local arp addresses.
	Ethernet arp has the following logic
		ARPAddAddr:
			for local, unicast addresses it
				subits an arp request
			 returns IP_PENDING

	NOTE: When sending an arp request, we need to be careful about which
		Src ip address we use -- using the one for the correct subnet!
		see ip\arp.c (SendARPRequest).

	CONFLICT:
		If it's a response confict and we're still registering the local address,
		we fail the local address by calling 
                SendARPRequest(Interface, *SPAddr, ARP_RESOLVING_GLOBAL,)
    IPAddAddrComplete(Address, SAC,   IP_DUPLICATE_ADDRESS);
    (where SAC == Context2 passed to our AddAddress routine).

Wed 11/03/1999  JosephJ	RM: factoring out common functionality for load/unload
	Rewriting adapter's arpTaskInitialize/ShutdownAdapter to be similar to
	the interface's in the sense that there is a primary and secondary task, 
	and the primary task is the one responsible for (a) waiting for other
	primary tasks to complete and (b) running the "compensating" transaction if the 
	the actual activate-adapter task fails. Also the task is written to minimize
	the adapter-specific code -- with the view towards of eventually having
	a generic RM-supplied task handler to do this for any object.
	arpTaskInitialize/ShutdownAdapter are also written to emulate the flattening
	of message types -- they handle start, pend-completes and end in a single
	case statement which supports fallthrough.
	TODO: consider adding pPrimaryTask and pSecondaryTask to the object header,
	and adding Init/Shutdown (aka load/unload) and activate/deactivate handlers
	to the object's static info. This will be required to move to 
	common load/unload handling.
	ALSO: look at arp[Set|Clear][Primary|Secondary]IfTask in util.c -- these
	could be generalized.

Wed 11/03/1999  JosephJ	RM: Generalizing load/unload to arbitrary tasks
	The general idea of (a) and (b) can be applied to other (user defined)
	operations on the object, not just init/shutdown. Think about how RM can
	provide standard "caretaker" tasks which will do (a) and (b) -- letting
	the user-defined tasks focus on pure functionality, not queuing and cleanup
	on failure -- the latter is a bit analogous to exception handling in the
	synchronous world.


Wed 11/03/1999  JosephJ	RM: More thoughts on state validation
	Add the concept of a state validation function which gets called to validate
	state transitions -- at the point the object is unlocked. The function is
	given the old and new states (the rm object dword state variable).

Wed 11/03/1999  JosephJ RM: Validate parent type
	Allow an object's static info to specify the allowed parent type -- this is
	important because much code assumes that a parent is of a particular type.

Fri 11/05/1999  JosephJ Why ICS wasn't binding to nic1394.h
	Needed to add ndis1394 to the lower binding in setup\inf\usa\icsharep.inx

Fri 11/05/1999  JosephJ Debugging the "autonet address" problem.

	The problem: We weren't getting an autonet address, and DHCP wasn't working.

	From Scott Holden:
		set a bp on RequestDHCPAddr (This is in VIP)

		If it hits this breakpoint, then we are going to DHCP.
		If it goes to DHCP, see if it hits VIP_Set_Addr or VIP_Set_Addr_Ex.

	I set and found out that it was being called, but eventually it was failing
	because arp1394 was failing a QueryInfo because it was not in the IF_PS_INITED
	state (because the interface's init task was still running). Setting
	the check in QueryInfo to take EITHER PS_INITED or AS_ACTIVATING made it
	work.

Fri 11/05/1999  JosephJ Re-wrote adapter init/shutdown code
	It's now a two-level scheme similar to what the interface uses --
	init/shutdown and activate/deactivate.

Thu 11/11/1999  JosephJ Deferred interface init until adapter is "connected"
	Modified  arpTaskInitInterface (co.c) so that it will check if the
	adapter is connected before proceeding to make the call to the broadcast
	VC and (and subsequently adding the IF). It currently simply waits for 5
	seconds before each attempt to check the connect state (it doesn't hook
	into the connect notification -- we should do that). It also needs to
	switch to passive before calling NdisRequest (which is actually a macro
	which ends up calling NdisCoRequest in the context of a work item) -- because
	we Block until the request completes asnc. So it's a lot of overhead just
	to get the connect status which would be eliminated if we hooked into
	the connect status notification. On the plus side: the modifications to 
    enable this  delay-until-connect functionalty is very localized -- score one
    for the RM Tasks!

Thu 11/11/1999  JosephJ RM: Finer granularity of tmpref end lock cheking
	We should add support for checking that there are no outstanding
	tmprefs and locks for *sub* trees of the call tree -- by allocating
	stack variables that save the value of the lock and tmpref on entry.

Thu 11/11/1999  JosephJ RM: More flexible display of object logs
	It would be nice to be able to display the integrated logs for an
	object and it's sub-object (optionally upto a certain level).
	We need to efficiently scan the global log looking for all entries
	which meet this criterion. How do we do this?

    One way is to build up
	a hierarchical naming scheme for objects -- so we just do a prefix match
	to decide if the object is a descendent of the particular top-level object
	whose logs we are displaying.

	All log entries will need to have the fully-qualified name of the object that
	created the log.

	A simpler scheme is simply to walk the parent list and display it if one of
	the ancestors is the top-level object -- probably this will suffice for now.

	TODO: we do need a way to keep logs available for objects that have gone away
	-- how to do this? And what are the implications for the above hierarchical
	display scheme?

Sat 11/13/1999  JosephJ Propery fill out arp sspd and maxrec

11/16/1999  JosephJ MCAP Details
	Receive side:
	* Single multi-channel VC
	* 64-byte TTL array for each channel.
	* Incoming MCAP advertisement:
		- go through recv mcast addresses -- If we're intersted in it,
		  add entry to channel.
	* New MCAST group to receive:
		- send out MCAP request 3 times and/or until resolved.
	* Timer:
		- Check TTL -- delete channel if required.

	array[] of (TTL, NodeID) Unknown NodeID == FF (after bus reset).
	64-bit bitmap of channels currently used

	pMultiRecvDest
		- Vc
		- Array of (TTL, NodeID)
		- Bitmap
		- pChangeChannelsTask

To Do:
	1. Mcap pkt parsing and generation code.
	2. Task to create multi-channel recv VC.	
	3. Fake multi-channel VC handler.
	4. Add recv mcast-address: Task to send out MCAP requests
	5. Timer code: check TTL for mcast; check arp table -- timer stops
	   if no activity.
	6. Make ipfwadm generate fake MCAP recv packets.

11/18/1999  JosephJ Target_ip_address in arp response
 From Sony's Kaz Honda November 18, 1999:
	> So in ARP responses, the target_IP_address should be ignored. Regardless, we
	> fill it with the target_IP_address
	> of the ARP request (not the destination IP address). I don't think we're
	> doing anything wrong here.
	
	Hmm... Year, you're right. You're doing anything wrong literally.
	But for the driver like ours which emulates Ethernet, 1394ARP is
	transformed into EtherARP and the driver must fill target_IP_address
	in EtherARP. So filling target_IP_address with the destination IP
	address is more helpful.

 So I now specify dest ip addr in the target_IP_address for arp responses.

01/28/2000  JosephJ MCAP revisited
	For now, we'll implement both send & receive side, and use regular channels,
	instead of multi-channel receive because of the complications of implementing
	multichannel receive in NIC.

	typedef struct
	{
		// Channel number.
		//
		UINT			Channel;

		// IP multicast group address bound to this channel.
		//
		IP_ADDRESS		IpAddress;

		// Absolute time at which this mapping will expire.
		//
		LARGE_INTEGER	ExpieryTime;

		// TBD
		//
		UINT			Flags;

		// NodeID of owner of this channel.
		//
		UINT			NodeId;

	} MCAP_CHANNEL_INFO;

	MCAP_CHANNEL_INFO McapInfoArray[NUM_CHANNELS];

	arpUpdateMcapInfo(pIF, pMcapPkt);


---------------------------------------
Receive side:
Every 10 seconds, we do the following:
Check our list of local multicst addresses -- if any of them are in our mcap
database, initiate calls to them.
If they are pointing to obsolete channels., we teardown calls from them.

This process only goes on as long as there are (a) local mcast ip addresses
and (b) received advertise msgs.


Send side:
Check channel db -- if address is assigned a channel, make call to it.


We're going to create CHANNEL "Destinations" for both send & receive.
We'll thus be getting packets on channels even if we aren't 
interested in them. That's ok for now; Later we'll add the ioctl support
for starting/stopping sends/receives.

So...

Destinations can be created if we're interested in either sending or receiving.

Periodic Task:
It's period varies depending on activity.
Can be woken up even if it's sleeping for a long time.

It does the following:

	1. Checks for ageing of pRemoteIPs
	2. Checks channel map and pDests, making sure that pDests are shut down if
	   uninteresting.
	3. Creates new pDests




ARP WORK ITEMS
1. Age out entries
2. Detect conflicts in local IP addresses.
3. Display only unicast addresses in ipconfig.
4. Don't queue packets to be sent out waiting for arp resolution -- only keep one
   packet.
5. Request an other FIFO address if ther one we asked for is already taken
   (or ask nic1394 to allocate one for us).
6. Remove "FATAL object locked w/o ..."
7. Hook CONNECT/DISCONNECT notifications, and bring down stack (add some
   damping).

DEBUGGING SUPPORT
1. Collect address-resolution time statistics.
2. OID to get and report NIC-specific stats via IPFWADM.EXE
x3. Option to make copies of packets on send and receive.
4. Simple memory alloc wrappers.
5. Get a13kd to work!
x6. Keep track of reentrancy
x7. MILL: make sure we call back to tcpip at passive.

IPFWADM modifications
Display address properly



ARP_COPY_RECV_PKTS
ARP_COPY_SEND_PKTS

02/05/2000 Fixed bug dealing with failure of const buffer allocation.
	If arpSendIpPkt can't allocate a const buffer, we call arpCompleteSentPkt
	with  special return value NDIS_STATUS_NOT_RESETTABLE so that it knows
	not to try to remove the const buffer. Of course, we'd break if the
	miniport sompletes a send with this status. We have an assert to catch that.

1. Change dest to include other params, change compare, "virtual channel"
2. Re-write IntF/DeintIF to use msg normallzation
3. Incorporate creation/deletion of maintenance task
4. Maintainance task:
	go through LIP list
	for each LIP
		go through channel list
			if you find  matching address
				find recv channel
					if found link?

	go through RIP list
	for each RIP send VC
		if !marked dirty
			mark dirty
			if linked to channel pdest
			check if channel is still mapped to group
			if not, unlink.
			if required initiate link to new pdest (possibly channel)
		else
			//expired
			unlink from pdest and get rid of it

	
	

	
	 

02/10/2000  RM API thoughts -- reducing stack depth
	
	See earlier references to  this problem:
		03/13/1999 	JosephJ New RM APIs RmResumeTaskAsync and RmResumeTaskDelayed
		03/25/1999 	JosephJ IPDelInterface should be called at PASSIVE!

	We can keep a list of tasks that need to be resumed in the stack record,
	and resume those tasks in the context of the first rm api call.

	Pseudo code:

	RmResumeTask:
	{

		SET_RESUME_PARAM(pTask, Status);
		QUEUE_RESUME_TASK(pTask, pSR);

		if (MUST_QUEUE_RESUMETASK(pSR))
		{
			return;						// RETURN
		}

		SET_MUST_QUEUE_RESUMETASK(pSR);

		while (resume-task queue not empty)
		{
			extract head of queue

			//
			// Code from current version of RmResumeTask goes here...
			// NOTE: the queue could get added to while processing this.
			//
		}
	}

02/11/2000  JosephJ When calling Mill IPAddInterface, it expects

			null terminated. We were hit by this because apparently we just

02/16/2000  JosephJ RM APIs observation
	Don't write code after "SuspendTask/PendTask" -- it may not get executed
	until after the task has been resumed -- this is counter intuitive.
	For example:
		we were setting pIF->pBroadcastDest to a pDest which was returned
		after calling RmPendTaskOnOtherTask -- well the code to
		set pIF->pBroadcastDest was not actually executed until the task
		was complete -- the task completed in the context of the call
		to RmPendTaskOnOtherTask itself! One more reason to implement
		the resume-task-at-top-level semantings. (see 02/10/2000  entry).

08/15/00 - Route Cache Entries.
		When the arp module is passed a Route Cache Entry, then it should
		validate its contents because the contents could point to
		another destination.

11/15/00 - Only applicable to bridge mode - 
	The bridge sends STA packets to detect loops. These packets have a 
	unique EtherType. Arp1394 now acccepts this EtherType and propogates it 
	over the wire as part of the Link Layer (IP1394 Encapsulation) header. 

	The receiving arp1394 recognises the STA EtherType and 
	constructs a new Ethernet Header for the Packet as it  is being translated
	into Ethernet.

	In bridge mode - The Remote Ip structure has an Ethernet Destination. This 
	causes problems when the pRemoteIp is used to construct an Arp Packet. 
	Therefore the actual Ip Address should be stored in pRemoteIp->IpAddress, 
	however all RemoteIp Lookups are done on the basis of the pRemoteIp->Key

12/14/00 - A deadlock was uncovered in RmLookupObjectInGroup. To fix it, the function
        can no longer guarantee the caller that the object will be created
        and locked in the same operation.  The Group lock will not be held
        in conjunction with the Object Lock.

12/14/01 - The PoMgmt code is being modified (for which notes were not added), 
	so that PoMgmt is always supported by the ARP module except in the corner 
	case wherein the Interface has not initialized yet. This is being done so 
	that the arp module does not get unbound from the nic when the machine is 
	standing by and thereby retains its IP address through the standby operation.

    First ntc checkin.  

            Outstanding nic issues - Media connect/ disconnect
    
            Removing timers from the recv code

10/26/99

	Added packet logging code. This can be activated by the PKT_LOG define

	Added Spin Lock debugging. This is currently used by reassembly structures only.


11/10/99

  For the reassembly structs-  garbage collection is performed in the following 
  manner. Whenever a reassembly is invalidated, it marks the reassembly 
  structure as dirty/ Every n seconds, the garbage collector comes around and 
  looks for reassmbly structs that need to aborted/freed. It pops them from the 
  remote node list and frees them.

  The only exception is in the remove remote node code path, Where  the 
  reassemblies are popped out of the list and freed




11/15/99 
   The bus driver does retry to send packets that have not been acknowledged.
   This causes fragments to arrive out of order

	An out of order packet can be inserted into the beginning ,end or middle of 
	an existing chain. FragTable in the REassembly structure is used to find
	the correct position

Adding Ethernet support :

Requests come down MpCoRequest, ICS calls on CLess Send handlers


Multichannel - Use ChannelVCs for now and allocate resources when the Oid 
comes down 

11/30/00 
In the bridge code path, it is possible for us to Load the ARP1394 Driver 
in the middle of a request. As part of its initialization, the arp module will
send requests down which do not get to us because NDIS has blocked all requests 
by setting the fMiniport_ProcessingRequest

1/21/02
The main change is to Fix Power Management support through a Hiberante/standby 
operation. To do this, the miniport needs to free all outstanding resources 
allocated on the 1394 bus. This is done in co-operation with the arp module, 
which is required to delete all of its VCs as part of the Set Power. 
The miniport then just frees the Broadcast Channel Register and enters into Low 
Power state.

As part of the resume, it will re-start the Broadcast Channel Register

    adapter.c: AtmArpPnpEventHandler checks if this is for us (atmarp) or IP.
            If it's us, it calls AtmArpPnPReconfigHandler which
            currently does nothing. I need to stop and restart the
            ip interface.
            Q: we specifically look for Reconfig and if not that we
            pass it up to IP -- shouldn't we be more discerning? How
            do IP reconfigs happen?

    callmgr.c AtmArpCoRequestHandler currently handles:

                    is onlyc alled from here and AtmArpUnbindAdapterHandler.
                Q: what events lead to each of the above?

    Q: Useful debugger extensions? ndis/atm-specific?
    Q: Dumping pInterface and other atmarpc structures?

	Implementing GetCfInfoName handler. Other place which this is implemented:
		ndis\trfccntl\psched3\psched.

	Need to return a systemwide unique unicode string
	* (confirm with ofer).
	atmarpc needs to allocate this and keep it alive for the duration of
	the flowinfo object. Simplest solution is to allocate it on creation
	of the flow (in the  AtmArpGpcAddCfInfoNotify function).

	Since it needs to be unique, we'll base it on the WMI interface name
	and keep a per-interface "flow index" which we'll tack on to the name.
	* Check with Ofer if this is ok.

	TODO: change to new address reporting format:
	NETWOR_ADDRESS: AttressType needs to be filled in to
		 NDIS_PROTOCOL_ID_TCPIP
	NETWORK_ADDDRESS_LIST: the Address array needs to be filled with
	type NETWORK_ADDRESS_IP, not the dword-sized IP_ADDRESS.

	Places which mess with pInterface->pAtmArpList:
	adapter.c: AtmArpShutdownInterface
	arpproc.c: AtmArpSearchForAtmentry -- looks for an atmentry and optionally 
				creates one if it doesn't match
	marspkt.c:	AtmArpMcHandleMulti -- adds an atm entry.
	utils.c:	AtmArpDereferenceAtmEntry	-- unlink an atmentry.
	utils.c:	AtmArpDeallocateInterface -- deallocating pInterface (goes 
				through and MEM_FREEs all atmarp entries.)
	Interface shutdown operation:
	 1st thing to do is to claim interface lock and set "shutting down bit" for 
	 	each list.
	 2nd: Do not allow list items to be added once this shutting-down bit 
	 	is set.
	 3rd: list is NEVER unlocked with entries having ref-count zero.
	 4th: If entry is unlocked and in list and list, it is always
	 	  in a consistant state -- even just before deallocating.
	 4th: If the entry is DOWN, don't do anything constructive with them.

	pInterface->pJoinList; is not protected when shutting down.
	it is manipulated in ipmcast.c, with the interface lock held, so
	it would be a matter of aquiring the interface lock when cleaning
	up pJoinList in ShutdownInterface.

	pUnresolvedVcs: locked by pInterface, but it is not protected
		in AtmArpCallConnectedHandler(...):
			pVc->pNextVc = pInterface->pUnresolvedVcs;
			pInterface->pUnresolvedVcs = pVc;
		(there is a check that pInterface->AdminState is up, but
		 we never claim the lock on pInterface!).
		(However, this applies only for PVCs, so perhaps this is not
		 such a big deal.)


	pAtmEntry->pVcList;

	AtmArpHandleInARPReply(...) acquires locks in the following order...

	{
	case Loading:
	case Active:
	case Deallocating:
		// check that various timer are not pending
		// check that "in-parent-list" bit is clear
	}
}

Structures to validate:
Following structures have timers/refcounts/locks

		ATMARP_ATM_ENTRY:				RefCount	Lock

		ATMARP_IPMC_ATM_ENTRY: 	Timer

		ATMARP_IPMC_JOIN_ENTRY: Timer	RefCount

		ATMARP_IP_ENTRY:		Timer	RefCount	Lock

		ATMARP_VC:				Timer	RefCount	Lock

		ATMARP_INTERFACE: 		Timer  	RefCount	InterfaceLock
								McTimer				ArpTableLock
													AtmEntryListLock
													TimerLock
													WmiLock

We can assert that contained timers are not active on deallocation of
a structure.

Following table lists the logical "parent" of each structure 
		ATMARP_ATM_ENTRY:		In INTERFACE:AtmEntryList
								flag:AA_ATM_ENTRY_ACTIVE

		ATMARP_IPMC_ATM_ENTRY:  In AtmArpEntry
		 						flag:AA_IPMC_AE_VALID use this?

		ATMARP_IPMC_ATM_INFO:
								flag: AA_IPMC_AI_LOAD_ALIVE

		ATMARP_IPMC_JOIN_ENTRY: In AtmArpEntry flag:

		ATMARP_IP_ENTRY:		In ArpTable
								 flags: AA_IP_ENTRY_IDLE

		ATMARP_VC:				In	AtmEntry
									flags: AA_VC_OWNER

		ATMARP_INTERFACE:		In Adapter.
									flags: AA_IF_, AAMC_IF_

We can maintain a "keep alive" bit which is set once the item is in the
the  parent and cleared when it is removed from the 
parent. We will assert that the "keep alive" bit is clear when deallocating
the structure.

		LOAD_STATE
			LS_LOADING -- don't use yet
			LS_LOADED  -- ok to use
			LS_UNLOADING -- don't start any new activity
			LS_UNLOADED -- ok to delete.

		* Added extra asserts that timer is not active when the containing
	 		structure is freed (look for TIMER_IS_ACTIVE)
		* Added ULONG Filler to  AAD_ALLOCATION so that allocated structures
		  retain 8-byte allignment -- not having this allighment was causing
		  the checked alpha build to fault when executing the following:
			AA_PUSH_TO_SLIST(
					&(pInterface->HeaderPool[HdrType].HeaderBufList),
					STRUCT_OF(AA_SINGLE_LIST_ENTRY, &(pNdisBuffer->Next), Next),
					&(pInterface->BufferLock.SpinLock)
				);
		
		(&(pInterface->HeaderPool[HdrType].HeaderBufList) needs to
	     be quadword (8-byte) aligned on the alpha, else it faults).

	     Note: SLIST_HEADER is a union which includes "LONGLONG", so
	     it WILL be quadword aligned provided it's hierarchy of parent
	     structures is aligned, no matter where this occurs within the
	     parent structures. Also added use of  AA_INIT_SLIST to initialize
	     BufferPool slists.

	    * Fixed misuse of certain bits of the IPEntry.Flags which were resulting
	      in Flags getting into an incorrect state. ("|=" was used instead
	      of AA_SET_FLAG when setting AA_IP_ENTRY_ARPING and
		  AA_IP_ENTRY_INARPING).

		* Make sure timer is stopped when unlinking a McAtmEntry.

		* Protected adding AtmEntry by locking the interface list lock
		  in AtmArpMcHandleMulti. This also required some re-ordering
		  of reference counting.

6/30/1998 JosephJ
	On ArvindM's advice: Changed AtmArpCompleteUnbindAdapter() so that it
	doesn't block waiting for NdisCloseAdapter to complete if it returns
	pending -- instead we return immediately and do the actual cleanup
	in the AtmArpCloseAdapterCompleteHandler. This also eliminated a specific
	bug where were were faulting because we weren't blocking when we should.

arpproc.c AtmArpAbortIPEntry: *ppNextIpEntry = pIpEntry->pNextToAtm;
	this is done while holding the ATM_ENTRY's lock, but
	in  AtmArpInvalidateAtmEntry, we count the number of ip entries 
	in the atm_entry's list, and use this count, all without holding
	the atm_entry's lock.

	Also in AtmArpMcHandleMulti, marspkt.c, line 793 -- the list is added to...
	 we should fail the earlier SearchFor...

	Also in AtmArpUnlinkIpEntryFromAtmEntry (utils.c), but no one seems to
	call it.

7/8/1998 JosephJ

	This concerns bug  191188(Intermittent loss of connections during
	multicast  IP and Ws stress).

	There are three issues so far:
	1. Sometimes, an AtmEntry gets in the CLOSING state, but it never goes
		away. I still haven't figured why it doesn't go away, but the 
		workaround (checked in today) is for AtmArpSearchForAtmEntry to
		clear the state from CLOSING if the entry is basically idle (no
		IP entries, multicast entries and vc attached to it).
	2. The mars server was sending us too-short packets. This is fixed
	   in the mars server (setting the ValidCounts field of the packet
	   in the mars server to FALSE). I also made a change to our
	   incoming packet handler to actually check packet length.

	3. The multicast ip entries don't seem to ever get deleted -- I saw
	   over 500 entries after an hour or so of anilth's multicast stress.
	   This is still unresolved (bug#194613).

	Note: on startup, the initial attempt to connect to the arp/mars server
	often fails (when it's on the same machine as the client -- it's probably
	an order-of load problem). Anyway, as a consequence of the call failing,
	AtmArpInvalidateAtmEntry is called, which sets the AtmArpEntry state
	to CLOSING -- it stays in that state for as long is the entry is alive.
	However with the workaround #1 above, the CLOSING state is now cleared on
	the first call to AtmArpSearchForAtmEntry after the initial vc is
	cleared up.

7/14/1998 JosephJ
	Looking at a an assert failure during reconfig -- the assert is
	in AtmArpCallCompleteHandler (assert(rc==0):

		else
		{
			//
			//  The Interface is going down: clean up everything first.
			//
			...
			else
			{
				//  MakeCall had failed. (And the IF is going down)
	
				rc =  AtmArpDereferenceVc(pVc);	// Create Vc ref
				AA_ASSERT(rc == 0);		// The VC should have been deallocated
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ above asser failed.
			...
	
	NOTE: AtmArpCloseCallMgr munges the pInterface but without holding
	its lock (it's called either on a failed init or on
	AtmArpShutdownInterface).

	NOTE: in  AtmArpMakeCallCompleteHandler(), we look at the
    pInterface->AdminState without claiming its lock:
    if (pInterface->AdminState == IF_STATUS_UP)...

	NOTE: Since  NdisCoDeleteVc is called only when rc==0 (in the context
	of AtmArpDereferenceVc), if the ref count doesn't go to zero, NdisCoDeleteVc
	will never be called. This means that the CloseCallMgr completion
	handler will never get called, which means that we'll never complete
	the reconfig request! So this explains why after hitting "g" after the
	assert, ndis complained that I never completed the reconfig request.
	So now I've got to track down why the ref count is still one. One thing
	in our favor is that this is a freshly created call -- it was make call
	that failed asynchronously.

	Some things to note:
	The only atm_entry has no vc links, and the vc has no atm_entry link.
	The interface is closing and it's af-handle is null, indicating that
	NdisClCloseAf has been called (as one would expect).

	The vc flags are: outgoing, svc, closing.

		rc =  AtmArpDereferenceVc(pVc);
			// Create Vc ref	-- derefed when calling NdisCoDeleteVc
			// Call ref			-- derefed in closecall complete handler
			// Atm ref.			-- derefed when unlinking linkage with atmentry.

	So in this particular case, the bug was that in the above code
    in AtmArpCallCompleteHandler we need an extra dereference (for
	call ref) just above the assert. So I added the following lines just
	before the assert:
			//
			//  Delete the Call reference
			//
			rc = AtmArpDereferenceVc(pVc);
			AA_ASSERT(rc > 0);

    Case closed. (Code checked in 7/17/1998, callmgr.c).

	QoS folks hit a bugcheck when sending on an unspecified flow.
	(198733	bugcheck in atmarpc!AtmArpDereferenceAtmEntry with best-effort
	 flow installed).

7/17/1998 JosephJ
	Above bugcheck was due to a hole in AtmArpLearnIPToAtm -- it would
	not have a ref on the atmentry when it sent packets on the entry at the
	end of the function. Fixed this by adding a temp ref. Also changed
	some AA_ACQUIRE/RELEASE_IE/AE_LOCK_DPC in this function to the non-DPC
    versions (they should have been the non-DPC versions all along).

7/17/1998 JosephJ
	Another bugcheck hit during alpha mcast stress -- 
	The bugcheck in the tick handler happened because of a bogus timer entry.
 The timer entry itself was part of a freed structure that was formerly owned
 by arpc, and was clearly a previously freed ATMARP_IPMC_JOIN_ENTRY (also,
 the other, timers at that particular location in the timer list were all valid
 join entries).

 So the question is why was this join entry prematurely freed?

  Looking at the code, I see one place where there is a race condition.
  The entire join entry list is in general protected by the interface lock.
  However, in AtmArpMcSendPendingJoins, the lock is released briefly while
  processing the list -- this is not good and could definitely cause things
  like starting a timer on a just-released (by some other thread) join entry.

  I couldn't find any more race conditions or other problems on the join list--
  everywhere else the IF lock is held the whole time, plus the ref counting
  seems to be good everywhere as far as I can see.

  The workaround,  in AtmArpMcSendPendingJoins, is to go through the list of
  joins with the interface lock held once, counting the number of joins that
  need to be sent. I then allocate space to hold all the ipaddresses and masks
  and then go through a 2nd time (still holding the interface lock), picking
  up the ip addresses and masks. I then send each of these ip addresses
  (the if lock gets released per send, but that's ok).

  This is checked in today.

8/31/1998 JosephJ Promiscuous mode multicast

   We treat promiscuous mode multicast as a special case:
   On enabling, we send a "JOIN-all" request.
   On disabling, we send a "LEAVE-all".
    


    Note, tcpip keeps a ref count of apps which request a particular type of
    filter, so if multiple apps request the same type, it sends down multiple
    calls to enable it, but only ONE call to disable it -- when the last app that
    requested it disables it. It does send each type independantly -- i.e., even
    if promiscuous mode is already requested, it will send down a ALL_MULTICAST
    if an app subsequently asks for that.

    Summary of changes made:
    arpif.c,util.c: new entrypoint AtmArpIfSetNdisRequest -- it calls
    			AtmArpMcAdd/DelAddress, specifying the entire address range.
	ipmcast.c, marspkt.c: now deal with non-zero mask values in JOIN_ENTRY -- when
			searching for a particular join entry, checks both IP address
			and mask (so group 224.0.0.0 can coexist with the join
			entry representing the entire class-d address space -- both have
			IP address value of 224.0.0.0).
			AtmArpMcHandleJoinOrLeaveCompletion -- has extra parameter: Mask.
	atmarp.h: ATMARP_INTERFACE has a new DWORD: EnabledIPFilters -- used
		 	to track whether promiscuous mode is enabled or not -- required
		 	because we may get multiple enable requests but only one
		 	disable request.
	sources: cdefine PROMIS added, enabling promiscuous mode code.

    Test Using \\anilth_1\allpkts\obj\i386\allpkts.....
    Winsock(1)== all pkts       == OID(0x20==NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_PROMISCUOUS)
    Winsock(2)== all mcast pkts == OID(0x04==NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_ALL_MULTICAST)
    Winsock(3)== all igmp pkts  == OID(0x04==NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_ALL_MULTICAST)

    We specifically look for OID NDIS_TYPE_ALL_MULTICAST and fail for
    others.

    Test cases: start allpkts.exe before/after someone has started sending
    to a particular mcast exe. Boundary cases: have allpkts.exe running on
    a machine which is also monitoring 224.0.0.0 and 239.-1.-1.-1.
    Various combinations of MCS-served address ranges.

	Fix for bug# 225578	ATMAPRC Hangs when disabling in UI
	Following changes to get rid of a atmarpc not completing shutdown because
	there was an active vc that (the vc to the arp/mars server was always
	in the closing state even as new calls were made to it).
	* AtmArpAtmEntryIsReallyClosing() also check if there are any VCs active
	  when checking if the entry is truly idle.
	* AtmArpSearchForAtmAddress -- fail if interface is down.
	* AtmArpMakeCall -- fail if interface is down or if atm entry is REALLY
	  closing (i.e., AtmArpAtmEntryIsReallyClosing returns TRUE).

09/23/1998 JosephJ
	A couple of anomalies:
	1. 	When joining a vc-mesh mcast group for which there is already at least one
	 	member and there is a local send already in progress, the local host 
	 	does not add itself to the vc mesh -- it gets the JOIN from the mars
	 	server on the cc vc, but simply treates as the JOIN completion. Fix
	 	is to ALSO process these "self-JOINS" which come on the ccvc to see
	 	if they must be added to current P2MP vc-mesh connections.
	 	[Fixed on 9/25/1998 checkin]
	2.	If a make-call fails with a non-NULL flow, the link between flow and vc
		is not deleted when the call is cleaned up -- leaving the flow referencing
		a dangling vc (only ref to the vc is the flow). This means that all
	 	subsequent vc's created for that flow will not be linked to the flow and
		so all send packets will need to explicitly look for vc's based on 
		flow characteristics. Fix is to delete the flow-vc association if it
		exists when handling a failed makecallcomplete.
		[Fixed on 9/25/1998 checkin]

		NOTE: FlowsInfo's are not protected by a crit sect, so race conditions
		are possible, for example:
		(a) flow is removed (AtmArpGpcRemoveCfInfoNotify) at the same time that the
		 vc is closing (AtmArpCloseCall) -- both could try to un-link the
		 vc and flow at the same time. It doesn't help that both claim the vc
		 lock. Potential fixes: (a) add lock to flows or (b) use
		 Interlocked[Compare]ExchangePointer when modifying FlowInfo->pVc.
		 [Fixed on 9/25/1998 checkin, using the Inerlocked functions approach]

	From:	Amritansh Raghav 
	Sent:	Tuesday, October 13, 1998 2:27 PM
	Subject:	RE: new llipif.h

		(i) Pass the old interface name as the DeviceName and NULL for the IfName
		(ii) Pass 0 for Requested Index
		(iii) You need to have place holders for the 3 functions, but you dont need
 			to call those functions ever.
	
		Reasons:
		(i) If you multiplex different connections over the same device, s.t. at any
			given time only one connection is active, then the ifName allows you to
			associate a name different that the device name with the interface. This
			is done so that if you have a phonebook entry called Redmond and it is
			connected, doing ipconfig shows Redmond and not NdiswanIpOut{Guid}
		(ii) This allows wanarp to reserve certain indices so that the ifIndex
			 doesnt change when the router starts
		(iii) The three functions basically change the info above

	Other changes in todays checkin:
	Added the assert AA_ASSERT(AA_IE_IS_ALIVE(pIpEntry)) pretty much every time
	we lock the pIpEntry. This is because in principle it's possible for
	the ip entry to be used justafter it's been removed from the the arp table.

	arpproc.c:
		AtmArpCleanupArpTable -- don't delete entries if they are in the ARPING
				state.
		AtmArpResolveIpEntry - don't do it if !AA_IE_IS_ALIVE
		AtmArpAbortIPEntry - remove packet queue AFTER claiming lock on IpEntry for
				the last time (otherwise others could queue packets in between us
				taking the packets and freeing the entry.
		AtmArpQueuePacketsOnIPEntry - dont do it if !AA_IE_IS_ALIVE

	marspkt.c: AtmArpMcHandleMulti -- don't bindly assume that if the pAtmEntry
		exists then it is compatible with the received MULTI pkt: i.e.,
		MCS served or VC-mesh served. Added code to abort the IP entry if
		they are incompatible.

		ipmcast.c v11       McUpdateConnection: bail if vc is being closed. We
							were hitting a case where we were trying to add a party
							using an already-deleted entry, which we
							avoid by this check. The use of already-deleted entry was
							probably because we run through the list of entries
							but release the atm lock in the middle -- fixed that as

		When migrating arp/mars server to another machine on the fly, clients
		bugchecked during mcast stress, because an mcast address switched from
		being VC-mesh to MCS served, and we forget to deref the ipentry
		before aborting the address: marspkt.c, look for 
		 "HandleMulti: Type Mismatch!." Fix is to add the deref before
		 calling AbortIpEntry.

	arpwmi.c -- timothyw's code examination found some potential
		cases (bug 303707), plus potential mem leak (bug 296220).
		Trivial fixes.
	callmgr.c -- fix for following bugs:
		305905	*ATMARPC: bugcheck running TDI test
			(needed to unlock vc if ref count is nonzero, instead of
			assuming that the refcount was zero)
		303172	*ATMARPC: doesn't call NdisClCloseCall when the miniport
 					fails to activate the VC
			(if we get an incoming close call while the vc was not yet
			connected, we need to act on it -- we "fake" the vc to be
			active so that subsequent processing works).
	qos.c	-- fix for the following:
		301210	*Traffic Control functional test failure on
				 ATM: expect ERROR_INVALID_PEAK_RATE, got 
				 ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN_RATE
		(fix is to change the error returned for this case --
		 see  "3/15/1999 JosephJ: According	 to EricEil..." comment
		 in 	qos.c).

03/24/1999 	JosephJ Fix for #310493
	310493	ATMARPC bugchks on getting bad control packet

	A rogue pkt was transmitted on the CCVC, causing all arp clients to bugchk
	in AtmArpMcProcessPacket(...). Fix is essentially to change all length
	variables in that function from SHORT to ULONG (SHORT vars could get -ve
	values, which mess up comparisons and additions).

04/20/1999  JosephJ	Proposed fix for  284644	Only one IP can be associated with
	a PVC or group of PVCs

	We're going to fix this in a general way by allowing static arp entries.
	- On loading, we'll read a set of <atm-address>-to-<ip address> mappings and
	  populate the arp cache with that. Support is already present in atmarpc.sys
	  for static arp entries.
	- User has to create custom PVCs for each destination from the call mgr
	  UI.
	- User has to directly enter these mappings into the registry -- under
		the atmarp settings under tcp settings for the adapter, we'll create a
		new key:
			StaticArpList - this is a REG_MULTI_SZ, with entries of the form:
				<ip-address>-<atm-address>
				<ip-address>-<atm-address>
				...
	  
5/19/99	ArvindM 330544 Fix for bugcheck in TickHandler

	The suspect is a Join Entry that has been freed in AtmArpMcHandleMARSFailure
	(the IF flags were 0x1100 in one case). The timer could have been in the
	expired list held by TickHandler. Added code to ref/deref Join Entries.

8/4/99	ArvindM 382619 Race between Unbind and AfRegisterNotify handlers

	NDIS isn't serializing calls to these handlers, so we hit a case where the
	AfRegisterNotify handler is chugging along when the Unbind handler comes in
	and deletes the Interface. Workaround is to note down the fact that we are
	processing an Af Notification and in Unbind handler, wait for that notification
	thread to complete. Added ATMARP_ADAPTER.UnbindBlock and an Adapter flag
	AA_ADAPTER_FLAGS_PROCESSING_AF for this. Note that this only shortens the
	window - the proper fix should be in NDIS.

08/09/1999  JosephJ Cleanup error handling code in DriverEntry
	We were deleting the device object twice in the error path.


08/12/1999	ArvindM 386639 Access NULL McAtmEntry in McMakeCallComplete.
	In McUpdateConnection, we used to simply pick up the first MC ATM Entry in the
	list to use as the party context in a MakeCall. Now this entry could
	be running the retry-delay timer. If this timer fires before the MakeCall
	completes, it will overwrite the MC ATM Entry state to DISCONNECTED.
	In McMakeCallComplete, we look for an MC ATM Entry whose state is WACK_ADD_xxx,
	and fail to find one.

	The fix is in AtmArpMcUpdateConnection: search the list of MC ATM entry
	structures for one that is VALID and DISCONNECTED. If there isn't any, bail out.
	If we find one, move it to the start of the MC Entry list, because AtmArpMakeCall
	always uses the first entry!

08/13/1999	ArvindM	387755 Add OutstandingSends counter to VC structure.
	We ran into an issue where we referenced a VC prior to sending a packet
	on it, but by the time NdisCoSendPackets was called, the VC was closed
	and DeleteVc'ed (it was owned by the call manager). So the call to NdisCoSendPackets
	bugchecked because the NdisVcHandle was bogus. To fix this, use this counter
	to keep track of outstanding (and on-the-verge-of-being-sent) packets on the VC. In
	AtmArpCloseCall, don't close the call if this count is non-zero. In CoSendComplete,
	check if the VC needs to be closed, and this count (after decrementing) just went
	to zero. If so, call AtmArpCloseCall.

10/15/1999  JosephJ dealing with suspend/resume and multiple AF registrations
	Fix for 415806: 
		Now AtmArpCoAfRegisterNotifyHandler will skip adapter-wide init
			(calling AtmArpCfgOpenLISConfiguration and AtmArpAddInterfaceToAdapter)
		if it's already been called before for this adapter.
	The previously-checked-in version would return failure immediately if
	it's been called for this adapter -- this was causing failure to re-add
	the IF after a hybernate (we are not getting a unbind/bind after hybernate
	because we passon the pnp-request up to IP which returns that it *can*
	handle hybernate) -- so instead the AF goes away and a new registeraf
    notification comes in on resume.

    We *do* need to skip the adapter-wide init because doing it a 2nd time
    causes some memory to be leaked.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\Normal.dot IP Over ATM User Guide for Windows NT Arvind Murching Arvind Murching Microsoft Word 6.0IP Over ATM User Guide for Windows NT Introduction This document describes the Installation and Configuration procedures to create an IP network over ATM. A brief introduction to the IP over ATM mechanism is included. The terms  IP over ATM Client ARP Client , and  Client  are used interchangeably, as are  IP over ATM Server ARP Server  and  Server References RFC 1577, Classical IP and ARP over ATM. Internet Draft <draft-ietf-ion-classic2-00.txt>, Classical IP and ARP over ATM. RFC 1755, ATM Signaling Support for IP over ATM. IP Over ATM Operation This section gives an overview of the theory of operation of an IP over ATM network. More details can be found in the references. Logical IP Subnet RFC 1577 (and successors) define the basic operation of an IP over ATM network, or more precisely, a Logical IP Subnet over an ATM network. A Logical IP Subnet or LIS is, broadly, a set of IP hosts that can communicate directly with each other. By definition, two hosts belonging to different LIS  can communicate only via an IP router, which is a member of both LIS Address Resolution via ARP Server The main problem to be solved in an IP over ATM network is that of address resolution, i.e. mapping an IP address to a  hardware address , in this case, an ATM address. On an Ethernet network, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for this purpose. Since an ATM network is non-broadcast by nature, this protocol cannot be used as is. Rather, a dedicated Address Resolution server (ARP Server) is used to provide IP to ATM address resolution. One of the stations in an LIS is designated as an ARP Server (and the ARP Server software is loaded on it). Stations that use the services of the ARP Server are referred to as ARP Clients, or simply, client. All IP stations within an LIS are ARP Clients. Each ARP Client is configured with the ATM Address of the ARP Server. When an ARP client starts up, it makes an ATM connection to the ARP server, and sends a packet to the server that contains the client s IP address and the client s ATM address. The ARP server builds a table of IP address to ATM address mappings. When a client has an IP packet to be sent to another client (whose IP address is known, but ATM address is unknown), it first queries the ARP Server for the ATM address of the desired client. On receiving a reply that contains the desired ATM address, the client establishes a direct ATM connection to the destination client and sends IP packets for that client on this connection. All ATM connections, including the connection to the server, are aged out by clients on detecting inactivity. All clients refresh their IP, ATM address information with the server periodically (the default is 15 minutes). An entry that is not refreshed for a while (default: 20 minutes) will be purged by the server. Multi-homing and Multiple LIS support A multi-homed IP host is one that is reachable via more than one IP address. It may or may not possess multiple physical network interfaces. With IP over ATM, it is possible to configure multiple logical or virtual network interfaces on a single ATM adapter. The IP layer would see these as multiple ARP interfaces, and does not care that they are all created on the same physical adapter. Each virtual interface would be part of a different IP over ATM LIS, and the ARP client entity for each virtual interface can potentially connect to a different ARP server. Using this concept, it is possible to build a router for an IP over ATM network that operates on multiple virtual interfaces, all configured on the same ATM link.   REF _Ref371142172 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 1  shows such a scenario, with stations belonging to two subnets (or LIS ): 10.X.X.X and 11.X.X.X. Each LIS has an ARP server that caters to that LIS. One endstation (10.0.0.99/11.0.0.99) is configured as an ARP client on both subnets, and forwards packets between subnets. Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : Multiple Logical IP Subnets on the same ATM network, and Routing between them Windows Architecture This section discusses the way IP over ATM software (IP over ATM Client, IP over ATM Server) fits into the Windows TCP/IP and NDIS 4.1 architecture.   REF _Ref371127943 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 2  shows the schematic for the case of an Ethernet adapter as well as an ATM adapter. Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : IP over ATM in the Windows Networking Architecture The ARP Interface depicted shows one virtual network interface exposed above the ATM miniport, corresponding to a single LIS.  If required, the (ATM)ARP module can be configured to expose multiple ARP interfaces to IP. ARP Interface The IP layer in the TCP/IP stack uses the ARP Interface to send and receive packets over an interface. The ARP Interface is a set of function calls (e.g.  Transmit a packet ) that form the interface between the IP layer and an underlying ARP Module. The IP layer supports multiple ARP Interfaces, which could be over different media types. In   REF _Ref371127943 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 2 , the IP layer sees two Interfaces, one over Ethernet, and one over ATM. The ARP Module hides the specifics of the medium from the IP layer, and provides the abstract set of services defined by the ARP Interface. The IP over ATM Client is one such ARP module. Note that the common ARP module for Ethernet, Token Ring and FDDI is part of the TCP/IP driver (TCPIP.SYS). Each ARP module supports the ARP Interface at its upper edge, and is an NDIS protocol at its lower edge. As an NDIS protocol, an ARP module uses the appropriate NDIS services for each adapter it operates on. For media such as Ethernet, the (built-in) ARP module uses connection-less NDIS services. For connection-oriented media such as ATM, a different ARP module is needed, one that uses connection-oriented NDIS services. The basic function of any ARP module is to map the destination (next-hop) IP address for a packet to the hardware address of the station to which the packet is to be sent. The hardware address is a 6-byte MAC address for Ethernet, and a 20-byte ATM address for ATM. The mechanism used to obtain this address mapping is dependent on the underlying medium. In the case of Ethernet or Token Ring, ARP Requests and Replies sent on the broadcast hardware address are used to perform address resolution. In the case of ATM, the address resolution mechanism is as outlined in  IP over ATM Operation Windows NT Bindings The Windows NT system stores information about bindings between protocols and adapters in the registry. With the plug-and-play model, when a miniport driver registers an adapter with NDIS, NDIS informs all protocols bound to the adapter , by calling their BindAdapter handler routines. Within this routine, a protocol calls NdisOpenAdapter to initiate access to the adapter, and so on. When a network component (protocol or adapter) is installed, the setup program obtains information about the component, such as its type (e.g. ndisdriver, atmdriver) and its binding rules, from the INF file for the component. It is possible to define new component types and binding rules in this file. TCP/IP Bindings The TCP/IP protocol stack (including the built-in ARP module for Ethernet and the like) is defined as belonging to the class tcpipTransport, and any adapter that has a driver of class ndisDriver is defined to be  bindable  to tcpipTransport. When the driver for such an adapter registers with NDIS, NDIS calls the BindAdapter handler for TCP/IP, which is supplied by the built-in (Ethernet) ARP module. TCP/IP will attempt to run Ethernet-style ARP over the adapter. In the case of ATM, there are two differences. First, the built-in ARP module should not be activated over an ATM adapter. Rather, we need the ATM-ARP client module to be bound to such an adapter. Second, more than one ARP Interface might be exposed to TCP/IP, over a single ATM adapter (this is optional). To ensure that TCP/IP doesn t bind directly to an ATM adapter, the INF for an ATM adapter defines the component as belonging to class ndisAtmDriver, which is not bindable to tcpipTransport. Next, the INF creates  virtual  adapter instances called IPATMARP, one for each LIS configured on the adapter. These virtual adapters are defined to be of class ndisDriver, meaning that they get bound to TCP/IP, and show up the Network Control Panel as such. However, there is no real driver associated with these virtual adapters, because of which TCP/IP s BindAdapter handler will never get called on behalf of these, and so Ethernet-style ARP will not be run on these. Example A machine has an Ethernet adapter already installed, say  ENET1 . An ATM adapter is installed on this machine, with an instance name  ATMCARD2  (note that the instance number is automatically assigned). When the IP over ATM Client is installed, it will install one Logical IP subnet (LIS0) over ATMCARD2, and the resulting virtual adapter instance will be  IPATMARP3 . In the Network Control Panel, the bindings will look like: Adapter Bound Protocols ENET1 NetBEUI Protocol NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport TCP/IP Protocol WINS Client (TCP/IP) ATMCARD2 ATM UNI 3.1 Call Manager IP over ATM Client IP over ATM Server IPATMARP3 TCP/IP Protocol WINS Client (TCP/IP) Note that the IP over ATM Server component has a single binding, to the ATM adapter. Registry Layout For the IP over ATM Client Since the IP over ATM client installs itself as a protocol as well as a  virtual  adapter, the resulting registry layout is briefly discussed here.   REF _Ref372020253 \* MERGEFORMAT  Figure 3  shows an example of this layout, including the ATM Call Manager and TCP/IP sections.

Installation and Basic Configuration This section describes the installation of IP over ATM components, and configuring a single Logical IP Subnet. Prerequisites The IP over ATM components need the UNI 3.1 ATM Call Manager and an ATM adapter to be installed on the machine first. All machines are assumed to be ATM-connected to each other, meaning that there is a way for each pair of machines to set up an ATM connection between them. Installing IP over ATM Server One of the stations in the IP/ATM network must be designated as the IP over ATM server machine. Normally, the IP over ATM Client is also installed on this machine. Refer to Section   REF _Ref372007537 \n  5.1.3  for instructions on installing IP over ATM client software. Step 1: Select the Protocols tab within the Network Control Panel. Click on Add... for adding protocols. A list of network protocols is displayed. Step 2: Click on Have Disk. You will be prompted to enter the directory path for the software component. Enter <DriveName>:\atmarps and press RETURN. You will be prompted to confirm installation of  IP over ATM Server Step 3: When prompted to restart the machine, you can click on Yes if you have completed installing all ATM components, otherwise, click on No. Installing IP over ATM Client This component must be installed on all IP stations on the ATM network. The following information is needed for basic configuration of each client station: IP Address and Mask for the client. The network administrator should assign an IP address for the client, from the range of addresses allocated for the Logical IP subnet. The network mask is the appropriate IP address mask for the subnet. ATM Address of the IP over ATM Server. This can be obtained by running the  ATMADM -A  command from a command shell on the IP over ATM server machine. Step 1: Select the Protocols tab within the Network Control Panel. Click on Add... for adding protocols. A list of network protocols is displayed. Step 2: Click on Have Disk. You will be prompted to enter the directory path for the software component. Enter <DriveName>:\atmarpc and press RETURN. You will be prompted to confirm installation of  IP over ATM Client Step 3: A bindings review now takes place, during which TCP/IP pops up a menu  prompting you to configure the IP over ATM Client virtual adapter with an IP address. Enter the IP address assigned to the client, and the network mask for the subnet here. If you have a router on the IP/ATM network, you can optionally enter the IP address of the router as the Default Gateway entry. Step 4:  After entering the IP address for the client, the Network Control Panel prompts you to restart the machine. Select No here. Before restarting the machine, the ATM address of the IP over ATM server must be entered in the NT registry, as outlined in the following steps. Step 5: Start the Registry Editor by typing regedt32 at the command prompt. Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window, and navigate down the following path: SYSTEM - CurrentControlSet - Services. Step 6: Obtain the ATM adapter instance name to which the IP over ATM Client is bound. This name (e.g.  AIC59002 ) will be listed, along with a  \Device\  prefix (e.g.  \Device\AIC59002 ) in the Bind value under the atmarpc - Linkage key below the Services key. Step 7: Navigate to the adapter instance subkey below the Services key, and thence to the following subkey: Parameters\AtmArpC\LIS0\ARPServerList\Server1. There is one value under this key, AtmAddress. Change this value to the actual ATM address of the IP over ATM server. Exit regedt32, and restart the machine. Features This section lists some additional features provided with the IP over ATM components. Support for built-in commands The IP over ATM Client supports most of the built-in TCP/IP utilities: IPCONFIG: Display IP configuration information, including IP addresses, Network Masks and Gateway addresses. NETSTAT: TCP/IP Network statistics. Display ARP cache entries. Since the command can display only 6-byte MAC addresses, the ARP client reports only the ESI part of ATM addresses. Also, the -a option, to add ARP cache entries, is not supported. Registry Parameters This section lists configurable parameters for the IP over ATM components. IP over ATM Server Parameters The IP over ATM Server has two sets of parameters: Global parameters and per-adapter parameters. The server doesn t require parameters on a per-LIS basis, because a single instance of the server can be used to support multiple LIS IP over ATM Server Global Parameters These are stored under the Services\AtmArpS\Parameters key in the registry. The complete list is given below. Purpose Default Buffers DWORD The number of buffers used to store received ARP requests. Limits the number of ARP requests queued for processing. FlushTime DWORD The periodic interval at which the server saves the ARP cache to disk. A value of 0 here disables disk caching. 0 (minutes) IP over ATM Server Adapter Parameters These are stored under the Services\<AdapterInstance>\Parameters\AtmArpS key in the registry, and apply to all LIS  served by the server. Purpose Default Selector DWORD The SEL byte on which the Server receives incoming calls on this adapter. RegisteredAddresses MULTI A list of ATM addresses that the server registers with the switch. Clients could connect to the server using one of these addresses. <Empty list> IP over ATM Client Parameters As discussed in Section   REF _Ref372008228 \n  , the IP over ATM Client parameters for each Logical IP Subnet are present under the appropriate Services\<AdapterInstance>\Parameters\AtmArpC\LISi key in the registry. The complete parameter list is given below. Purpose Default SapSelector DWORD The SEL byte used as part of the IP/ATM client s address. Typically, this is set to i+1, where i is the LIS number, as in LISi. ServerConnectInterval DWORD The time between successive attempts to connect to the IP over ATM Server (if connect fails). 5 (secs) ServerRegistrationTimeout DWORD The time, after sending an ARP Request to register with the server, at which the registration attempt is declared to have failed. 3 (secs) AddressResolutionTimeout DWORD The time, after sending an ARP Request to resolve an IP address, at which the resolution attempt is declared to have failed. 3 (secs) ARPEntryAgingTimeout DWORD The time, after creating/refreshing an ARP cache entry, at which the entry is declared to be invalid. The client attempts to refresh this information by sending an ARP Request, only if a VC is associated with this entry. 900 (secs) InARPWaitTimeout DWORD The time, after sending an InARP Request to resolve a PVC, at which the attempt to resolve is deemed to have failed. 5 (secs) ServerRefreshTimeout DWORD The client s IP, ATM address information is sent to the server periodically at this interval. 900 (secs) MinWaitAfterNak DWORD On receiving an ARP NAK in response to an ARP Request sent to resolve an IP address, no more requests for this IP address are sent for this interval. 10 (secs) MaxRegistrationAttempts DWORD Number of times the client tries to register with the server. After exhausting this, the client moves to the next server in the ARPServerList (see below) if one exists, otherwise, to the first server in the list. MaxResolutionAttempts DWORD Number of times address resolution is attempted for an IP address. After exhausting this, the ARP cache entry for the IP address is deleted. DWORD Maximum Transmission Unit for the LIS. This is the value reported to the IP layer. 9188 (bytes) ARPServerList\ Key containing a list of ARP servers that the client tries to contact. Note: the client is registered with only one server at any point of time.      Server1\ Subkey containing information about the first ARP server. Multiple such subkeys can be created.          AtmAddress ATM Address of this ARP Server. ( End Of Document (  In certain cases, it may be possible to use the  well-known IP over ATM server address  that the INFs install by default. See  Well-known IP over ATM addresses  With NT 4.0 and early builds of NT 5.0, it is possible that this pop-up menu may not appear. If this is the case, when prompted to restart the machine, select No, restart Network Control Panel, select the Protocols tab, select  IP over ATM Client , click on Properties, and finally click on OK at the bottom of the panel. You should see a bindings review happen now, and the TCP/IP menu appear.

    As part of implementing promiscuous mode multicast, we need to make some changes
    to the mars server.

    Some observations:
    * RCF2022 has special support for routers wanting to monitor blocks of
      NONOVERLAPPING addresses. It handles these blocks somewhat independantly
      from individual group joins: a block can overlap one or more individual
      group joins. On leaving the block, the mars server maintains the
      individual group joins.

    Changes/fixes required:
    1. MarsPunchHoles needs to be written to change time complexity from
        O(number of addresses in block)
        to
        O(number of mcs address-ranges + number of individual groups).

        Currently, it runs through all 268 million possible addresses
        when processing a join of the entire class-D address space!

        Fix is jump to the end of the hole (if in a hole) or to the
        beginning of the next hole (if not in a hole).

        Also, it  was enumerating the list of groups wrongly -- using
        pGroup->Next instead of pGroup->NextGroup.

    2. MarsAddClusterMemberTogroups:
		When processing an join of the entire class-D space, it needs to check if
        the member has already joined the entire space, in which case it
        should treat the join request as a duplicate (send it back on the private
        vc). Currently it will treat it as a new entry and hence will send
		it on the cluster-control-vc. We would end up with duplicate entries.
        MarsDelClusterMemberFromGroups:
		Similarly, when when processing a leave of the entire class-D space
        when in fact the member has  already left, we must make sure
        that we reflect it privately.

	3. MARS_MULTI processing: MarsHandleRequest had to be modified to
		also return the hw addresses of members monitoring the entire class-D
		address space (but also make sure that it doesn't send duplicate
		hw addresses if the member is also minitoring the specific 
		group address).

	There are reports of bugchecks during boot up. One is bug# 212412
	(ATMARPS: MarsSendRedirect referenced past end of pool). The stack was:
	f7cfbcdc f276ba36 00000000 fa502000 00000000 ntoskrnl!KiTrap0E+0xc3
	f7cfbd80 f276cc04 80a11828 f92cff18 00000000 atmarps!MarsSendRedirect+0xbe

	MarsSendRedirect is a timer callback function. It it creates and sends
	a redirect packet containing all the configured and registered addresses.
	However it doesn't claim any lock. So it's possible that it's in the
	middle of doing this when registered addresses are added (they are
	added on ArpSCoRequestComplete callbacks.

	So we fix this by adding a lock to the interface when reading/modifying
	these addresses: in  MarsSendRedirect and in ArpSCoRequestComplete. Checked
	in today.

10/24/1998  JosephJ

	Added statistics -- created ARP_SERVER_STATISTICS and MARS_SERVER_STATISTICS
	(iocto.h, ioctl.c, also the added functionality to atmarp.exe to dump this
	stuff).

10/25/1998  JosephJ
	Added support to actually fill out the statistics: ndis.c, mars.c, arps.c, etc.

	Some clarifications...

	Mcast Joins: failed doesn't include dups.

	Mcast requests: MCMesh requests include responses to those nodes that are in 
	promiscuous mode.

	Discarded pkts: usually means pkts discarded due to error/unsupported format or 
	because a resource allocation failure. Also includes pkts discarded because 
	they are not from a cluster member. If the discarded pkt is known to be for a
	particular  task, say a join, then the count of failed joins is also incremented.
	
	We do not explicitly keep track of  failed mars or arp requests which are 
	ignored (either acked or nacked) -- so if you see the arp request count 
	increment but the ack+nak not incrementing, you can conclude that the request 
	is being ignored.

10/25/1998 JosephJ
	While implementing the above, found the following existing bugs:

	MarsReqThread -- if it gets a pkt with an unrecognized opcode, it simply
	leaves it in limbo -- it should put it back into the free list! Otherwise
	we'll soon run out of pkts if we get barraged with bad pkts.

	MarsDelClusterMemberFromGroups: it should
		 (a) delete a mars entry when
			it's list of members goes to NULL -- delete consists of removing
			it from the hash table and calling ArpSFreeBlock on it.
		 (b) actually free the pGroup, calling FREE_MEM.

	checked in  10/28/1998 

12/22/1998 

	Made a change to the following code in  ArpSCoRequestComplete:
	[Old code]
		pIntF->NumAddressesRegd ++;
		if (pIntF->NumAddressesRegd < pIntF->NumRegdAddresses)
		{
			...
		}
	[New code]
		We inly increment NumAddressRegd if 
		(pIntF->NumAddressesRegd < pIntF->NumRegdAddresses).
		We assert otherwise. See 12/22/1998 Note in
		ArpSCoRequestComplete for details.

	Bug: #297656 ATMARPS: Unbinding arp/mars on server A does not unregister
 			the well-known address from server A.
	Fix:
	I unregister the registered addresses in shutdowninterface, and block until all
	the unregistrations complete. I decided to block because the completions will
	likely be asynchronous and we immediately go on to close the Af and then
	deallocate the object, so I was not comfortable with not waiting for
	completions) of the unregistrations.

2/29/1999 JosephJ

	Stress hit the following assert with checked atmarpc.sys, 1990:
 	 	Assert NdisPartyHandle != NULL failed: file mars.c, line 3247

	The assert was because the ndispartyhandle was NULL in the context of  the
	dropparty handler.

	The crutial observation is the following 2 identical lines of debug spew before
	the assert:
	0:MARS:  AddMemberToCC: pVc 868178c8, pMember 87736808, ConnState 2
	0:MARS:  AddMemberToCC: pVc 868178c8, pMember 87736808, ConnState 2

	The 2nd call to NdisAddParty (from MarsAddMemberToClusterControlVc) clobbers
	the previous value of pMember->NdisPartyHandle on entry and then probably fails
	(because there's already a party).

	Looking for ways that MarsAddMemberToClusterControlVc could be called twice
	(which is not supposed to happen), the only way I can see this happening
	consistant with the  debug spew,  is that an incoming registration-join from a
	new member (MarsHandleJoin) came at the same time that we were handling
	post-processing of the initial CC MakeCall complete
	(ArpSMakeCallComplete, 1195,ndis.c).

	There are holes in the way vc and member flags are set and checked that would
	lead to MarsAddMemberToClusterControlVc being called from both code paths.
	(The enumeration in line 1185 of ArpSMakeCallComplete is also dangerous in
	that it could potentially deref a freed pMember, but that's not what happened
	here).

	The following functions have similary dangerous emumeration/assumption that
	pMember will be valid:
	 MarsAbortAllMembers
	 ArpSDropPartyComplete
	 MarsDelMemberFromClusterControlVc


	FIXES to all of the above:
	  1. Added new function MarsIsValidClusterMember that makes sure a particular
	     member is in the cluster list.
	  2. This function is called from:
		  MarsDelMemberFromClusterControlVc (which simply returns if invalid).
		  ArpSMakeCallComplete (which stops enumeration if a pMember is invalid).
	  3. MarsAbortAllMembers fixed to do a safe enumeration of all members.
	  4. MarsAddMemberToClusterControlVc returns without doing anything if
		if (MARS_GET_CM_CONN_STATE(pMember) != CM_CONN_IDLE) (check is made
		AFTER getting the IF lock).

04/20/1999 JosephJ Fix for 327626	Need Rouge ARP Server detection on ARP
	registration.

	1st version of fix:
	BEFORE registering address, we try to make a call to the address. If it
	succeeds, we log an event in the event log and fail the initialization.

	2nd version of fix: keep call open -- if we get an incoming close, we
	then try again.

	Note: it's possible that if two notes are doing this at the same time they
	may still both come up, i.e., rogue detection will fail.

05/05/1999  JosephJ 331517 - bugchecks due to wrong VC PacketSize
The bugchk was triggered by the fact that the mars server got several incoming VCs
with very large max packet size (they should all be 9188, but we saw 64008 for
several and 18200 for one).

Fix (in MarsHandleRequest (mars.c)) is to replace SHORT and USHORT local variables
by ULONG.

Fri 05/14/1999  JosephJ Rogue ARP server detection contd.
	Things are kicked off on getting a OID_CO_ADDRESS_CHANGE notification.
	We (as before) query the adapter for the configured address.
	On completion of this (OID_CO_GET_ADDRESS), we start the process of validating
 	and registering all addresses, by calling  ArpSValidateAndSetRegdAddresses.

	ArpSValidateAndSetRegdAddresses allocates and initializes pIntF->pRegAddrCtxt
    (which keeps all context associated with the validation and registration of
	addresses). A reference is added to pIntF for pRegAddrCtxt.
	The function then calls ArpSValidateOneRegdAddress. 

	ArpSValidateOneRegdAddress attempts to initiate the validation & registration
	of a single address. If there are no addresses left to be processed, it
	will unlink pIntF->pRegAddrCtxt (deref pIntF and deallocate pRegAddrCtxt).
	"Validation" consists of making a point-to-point to call to the address,
	using the same call params as the atmarp client uses. If the call fails,
	the address is considered "validated". The protocol's context for the VC
	is pRegAddrCtxt itself.

	The next stage happens in the make-call complete handler
	(ArpSMakeRegAddrCallComplete).

	ArpSMakeRegAddrCallComplete:
		- on successful make call (which is a failed validation),
		  it it immediately closes the call. The close call handler
		  (ArpSCloseRegAddrCallComplete) deltes the vc, increments
			pRegAddrCtxt->RegAddrIndex and calls
		  ArpSValidateOneRegdAddress (to initiate the validation & registration
		  of the NEXT address, if any).

		-- On failed make call (which is a successful validation), it deletes the
		  vc and initiates registration of the address (calls NdisRequest with
		  OID_CO_ADD_ADDRESS). On completion of the OID_CO_ADD_ADDRESS
		  (ArpSCoRequestComplete), we do the following:
		  	- on success, copy over the addres to
			 pIntF->RegAddresses[pIntF->NumAddressesRegd] and
			 increment pIntF->NumAddressesRegd ++
		   
		   - on failure or success, we increment pRegAddrCtxt->RegAddrIndex
			 and call ArpSValidateOneRegdAddress (to initiate the validation &
			 registration of the NEXT address, if any).

	A note on the use of pIntF->RegAddresses[...]
	This array is initialized with all the user-specified addresses read from
	the registry. As validation proceeds, however, the successfully validated
	and registered addresses are copied sequentially into this array. If
	*all* the addresses are successfully validated and registered, then the
	end values in the array is the same as the initial values. However, if
	some intermediate addresses are not validated or registered succcessfully,
	then the end result will be different. In all cases,  the first
	pIntF->NumAddressesRegd entries will contain the registered addresses.

09/30/1999  JosephJ Bug 405851
	*RC3SS: ATMARPS: Bugcheck unloading atmarps during shutdown
	The basic problem is that ArpSIfList contains a pointer to a just-freed pIF.
	
	The biggest problem I've found is that  INTF_CLOSING state is set only in the
	ArpSCloseAdapterComplete handler. This means that ArpSStopInterface (which
	calls on ArpSReferenceIntF which *does* check the INTF_CLOSING flag) can be
	called multiple times for the same adapter. Also ArpSReferenceIntF is called
	from some other places. ArpSStopInterface is  called from: ArpSShutDown
	(called from arp's unload handler as WELL as when handling IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN)
	ArpSCoRequest(AF closing)  and ArpSUnbindAdapter(unbind adapter handler).
	
	ArpSStopInterface is NOT idempotent (it expects to be called only once per pIF),
	but given the above, it CAN becalled multiple times per IF (i.e., because
	INTF_CLOSING is only set on close adapter complete).
	One specific problem with this: it assumes it can use pIntF->CleanupEvent.
	
	Another problem:
	ArpSShutDown: it goes through each IF in ArpSIfList, refs it (which would fail
	if the IF is INTF_CLOSING), release list lock, then calls ArpSStopInterface.
  	It is definately flawed in the way it uses pIF->Next -- pIF->Next could well be
	gone by the time it gets to it. HOWEVER that's not the problem we're seeing
	-- we're seeing the case of the ArpSIfList ITSELF being corrupted.
	
	FIXES:   
	1. arps.c ArpSShutdown now refs the pNext pointer -- a little bit of intricate
	   code that makes sure pNext is still around when we need it. 
	2. We use the INTF_ADAPTER_OPENED flag, set on successful completion of
	   open adapter (in ArpSOpenAdapterComplete). We use this to make sure
	   that NdisCloseAdapter is called only once. NdisCloseAdapter was called
	   in a bunch of places -- now we call ArpSTryCloseAdapter, which checks
	   the INTF_ADAPTER_OPENED flag first.
	3. ArpSStopInterface now doesn't clobber pIntF->CleanupEvent -- if it's
	   NON-NULL it simply doesn't wait.

10/07/1999  JosephJ fix for 412018
	*RC3SS: ATMARPS bugchecks on unloading if no call manager bound to adapter.
	On unloading, we were trying to deregister addresses which had never
	been registered (in fact the AF was never opened). Fix is in 
	DeregisterAllAddresses (ndis.c): it used to check that
	pIntF->NumAllocedRegdAddresses is non-null ; now it checks that
	NumAddressesRegd is non-null.

01/06/2000  JosephJ fix for 416301 corrupt ArpSIfList
	
	
	ArpSOpenAfComplete(ndis.c): we were setting a pInfF flag without holding the IF
	lock (we just had the IF list lock). This was possibly corrupting the other
	bits in the flag field. This is most likely the cause of the problem.
	Also got rid of INTF_IN_LIST field, which is not required.

	ArpSDereferenceIntF(arps.c): Arvindm added code to make sure two threads don't
	try to deref the interface to zero at the same time. This is not likely to
	be the cause of the bug (bug is that the list is corrupted, not that 
	an IF entry was de-allocated prematurely or twice) but is a hole that needs to
	be fixed.
03/30/2000  JosephJ Hit an assert in arps.c when the close-call handler for
    the validation make call (ArpSCloseRegAddrCallComplete) is called during
    shutdown -- we've nuked pIntF->NumAllocedRegdAddresses by this time as 
    part of shutdown, so the following assert in the function fails:
        ASSERT(pRegAddrCtxt->RegAddrIndex < pIntF->NumAllocedRegdAddresses);
    Fix is to bracket this code by  if (!(pIntF->Flags & INTF_STOPPING)).

04/18/2000  JosephJ
    Removed assert  from the code below in  ArpSValidateAndSetRegdAddresses

    if (pIntF->pRegAddrCtxt != NULL)
    {
        ASSERT(FALSE);
        break;
    }

    This could happen if we get an  OID_CO_ADDRESS_CHANGE when we are
    either processing an earlier one, or are in the process of
    initializing. We get this case (and hit the assert) during pnp stress

    Yesterday I quite successfully set things up so that the kd extensions could
    be tested as a simple console app. The code in main.c emulates kd from
    the point of view of the extension dll. It works remarkably well.
    The memory read/write operations simply read/write memory.

    I don't know how kd decides which operations are exported by the dll --
    does it simply try to do a getprocaddress for anything the user types

!aac a 0x80001092  -- dumps the adapter at the specified address.
!aac i	                 -- dumps the most recently referenced interface (1st time, it will dump the 1st interface of the 1st adapter).
!aac i.*list*	     -- dumps all fields of the most recently referenced interface stucture which match the pattern "*list*"
!aac ae[*].RefCount -- dumps the ip addreses of all the atm entries of the most recently referenced interface (yes, you can substitute any field name or pattern like "*Ref*"  for "RefCount").
!aac ip[*].IPAddress -- dumps the ref counts of all the ip address of the most recently reference atm entry.
!aac ip[1]                -- dumps the next ip structure in the list of ip structures for an atm entry (so you can step through the list items by successively calling !aac ip[1]).
!aac vc[*]	     -- dumps the vc list for the most recently referenced atm entry.
The dumping formats are terrible -- I'll clean it up and provide more type-friendly output format over time.

When the Protocol's Reconfigure handler is called, the protocol will be in one 
of two condtions - Its binding to the adapter below is open or the binding is 
closed.

if the blinding is closed, then the protocol will call NdisReEnumerate Bindings
and this will restart the Binding  and re-instantiate the miniports.

If the binding is open, then the miniport will walk through the registry and 
Initialize All Device Instances that have been disabled.

I noticed that when the last miniport is disabled, the driver gets unloaded 
causing the protocol to be unbound from the adapter.

README file for sample WINDBG (old stlye) extension simple.dll


This extsnsion dll shows how to write a simple extension and demostrates use of APIs in wdbgexts.h


Mandatory routines which must be implemented and exported for windbg style extensions:
VOID
WinDbgExtensionDllInit(
    PWINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS lpExtensionApis,
    USHORT MajorVersion,
    USHORT MinorVersion
    )

This is called on loading extension dll. Global variables and flags for extension should be initialized in this routine. One 
of the useful things to initialize is WINDBG_WNTENSION_APIS which has some commonly used APIS for memory reads and I/O.



LPEXT_API_VERSION
ExtensionApiVersion(
    VOID
    )
This tells debugger about version of the extension dll. The values returned by this will determine how extension of this
dll will be called. A common error while writing extensions is mismatched values of version returned be this routine as 
compared to what version dll was built with.

This has ApiVersion = { (VER_PRODUCTVERSION_W >> 8), 
                   (VER_PRODUCTVERSION_W & 0xff), 
                   EXT_API_VERSION_NUMBER64, 
                    0 };


VOID
CheckVersion(
    VOID
    )
This is called after the dll is loaded by the debugger. The extension dll can verify here if it was loaded for correct target.




Extension Calls
---------------

EXT_API_VERSION_NUMBER64 is needed for making 64-bit aware extensions, all addresses for these will then be ULONG64s, for this
an extension is defined as:
CPPMOD VOID 
extension(
        HANDLE                 hCurrentProcess,
        HANDLE                 hCurrentThread,
        ULONG64                dwCurrentPc,
        ULONG                  dwProcessor,
        PCSTR                  args
     )


Extensions
----------


help

Every extension dll should have one extension called 'help' which shows descriptions for extensions that are present in the dll.

%NWCLIENT_Desc% needs to be added
%NWCWORKSTATION_Desc% needs to be added

AddParametersKey does stuff for STF_UNATTENDED_SECTION like setting the DefaultLocation 
and DefaultScriptOptions on the Parameters key of the NWCWorkstation service. I've
never seen the NW setup do this, and I don't see where those are defined anyway. Weird.

Can't set permissions on the parameters/option key. Error code 122. Need debug
nwapi32.dll to find the problem.

Make sure that I'm not leaking memory or forgetting to close a reg key!!!

Do I have to add RPC stuff?

Rename Novell.cpl

Issues
------
    WAN devices vs. LAN devices.  Can we gen an indications of the "subclass"?
    Last protocol to be removed should cause something to happen with RAS.
    Can we reference count adapter installs?  (Maybe for Beta2)

We provide access to configuration, status, and invocation of connection objects. Definitions: Namespace extension   We essentially become a node in the existing standard window hierarchy. For now, we are a child of the Control Panel: (My Computer->Control Panel->Network and Dial-up Connections) IShellFolder   The base interface for accessing a namespace extension. Implemented in  \config\shell\folder\ishellf.cpp. Provides access to our view objects (ishellv.cpp), our enumerator (ienumidl.cpp), and a multitude of other interfaces (ipersistf.cpp, ipersistf2.cpp, i*.cpp). Network Connections Manager   Provides an enumerator (CLSID_ConnectionManager), which has the standard Reset, Next, Skip enumerator. We get them one by one, retrieve their properties, and fill our connection cache. The shell retrieves this info (in opaque format) via our folder enumerator (ienumidl.cpp), and uses that info to call back and retrieve specifics.  EMBED PBrush   Interesting pieces of above image: Webview   This is owned by the shell team, but uses our IShellDetails interfaces through Java to extract relevant info about selections. See %windir%\web\dialup.htt for the Javascript source. Example:            function Connect() {                 if (FileList.SelectedItems().Count)                     FileList.SelectedItems().Item(0).InvokeVerb(L_Connect_Text);             } This gets a list of the selected items, and can invoke the  Connect  verb on those Items. To do this, it loads our context menu and invokes  Connect  (see icontextm.cpp). Todd Ouzts is the PM owner of this file,  and typically makes the bugfixes. Details view   Extracted through IShellDetails, which is queried for through IShellView. Our IShellView implementation comes from defview (Default IShellView), which is a shell32.dll component. It provides a standard IShellView implementation for multiple internal windows shell folder extensions, taking some of the pain out of implementing a standard folder. Other important aspects of this part of the folder are: Defview   Explained above a little bit, it uses callbacks to the specific folder implementation to get our various underlying implementations of toolbars, tooltips, details, etc (each of the pieces listed below) Context menus   Right clicking in this portion of the folder causes our IContextMenu interfaces to be instantiated and queried for info. The shell does this by passing us the pidl (opaque data) to us along with an HMENU and requests that we merge the menu and return. See icontextm.cpp for implementation. Tooltips   Hovering over a connection causes our IQueryInfo interface (iqinfo.cpp) to be instantiated and queried. Code is pretty self-explanatory Icons   Defview uses our IExtractIcon (iextract.cpp) code to load and update icons based on their status and media type. All of our icons, with the exception of those made via CM (Connection Manager, not to be confused with Network Connection Manager), are loaded directly from netshell.dll itself. CM connections may contain  branded icons , which are loaded from the Connection Manager profile (see NickBall for details or see our usage in iextract.cpp).  Make New Connection wizard   Also owned by our team, we provide a icon that launches the wizard (see oncommand.cpp, OnCommandNewConnection). Folder background   When right-clicking on the folder background, IContextMenu is invoked as well, but uses different flags and will retrieve different menus. I ve implemented icontextm.cpp in such a way that most of the code is shared between the object menus and the background menus. See the CMT_ defines in confold.h. The rest should be obvious from the implementation. Menus   Our menus are loaded via defview as well via a callback. We merge our connection-specific commands into the file and context menus, and then modify them as needed based on connection state and selection (we disable the  status  command when a connection is disconnected, for instance). See cmdtable.cpp for this code   it should be very clear. Toolbar   We have toolbar code, but it is currently completely unused as we have no toolbar buttons. Implementing static toolbar items is simple, but if you ever need to enable/disable these buttons, you may have to implement other Shell interfaces IShellToolbar?)  Connection Properties: When selecting properties from the context menu of a connection in the folder, we bring up a properties dialog. This dialog is different for RAS and LAN   the actual code is in shell\lanui (LAN) and shell\wanui (RAS). This code provides property sheet pages to conprops.cpp in the folder directory. The RAS implementation is owned by the RAS team itself (currently Pmay). The LAN config obiect is owned internally and ties into the bindings engine and core NetCfg code. Permissions: \net\config\common\ncbase\ncperms.cpp FHasPermission contains the check routine for GP (Group Policy) settings. We load these the first time one is used, and optionally cache them. These are set at a computer level or user level, and administrators are assumed to have all permissions. Users have a subsetup; that subset can be found in RefreshAllPermission   look for FcheckGroupMembership(DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_USERS). Group policy is managed via: mmc.exe, Console   Add Snap-In.  Choose the Group Policy Snap-In. Open Local Computer Policy, User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Network, Network and Dial-up Connections Configure policies. By default, all are  Not Configured . You can explicitly enable/disable individual policies. These will affect Users/Power Users. In the future, we need to do two things here: All policies are supposed to be  Disable/Lock-down  policies, meaning that if they are not configured, the user will have full permission. Ours are a mishmash of  Enable  and  Disable  policies. Because of this, it s not clear to the admin whether the default is on/off. It s ugly. We need to make use of these policies outside of the connections folder. For instance, we may lockdown the ability to connect/disconnect connections in the policy editor, but nothing prevents them from using the RAS API s to do the same thing. Our policies should apply to any RAS usage.

dhcploc:

This utility can be used to detect unauthorized DHCP server on a subnet.
It displays the dhcp servers that are active on the subnet and beeps and
sends out alert messages when it sees from any unauthorized dhcp
servers. The usage of this tool is as given below :

dhcploc [-p] [-a:"list-of-alertnames"] [-i:alertinterval] machine-ip-address [list of valid dhcp servers ip addresses]

machine-ip-address - ip address of the machine where the utility is
run. If the machine has multiple adapters then you need to select an
adapter (and the corresponding ip address) that is connected to the
subnet under test.

list of valid dhcp servers - you can specify any number of authorized
dhcp servers' ip addresses here. This utility will be silent if it sees any
packets from these server. However it will display the packets it sees
from these servers unless '-p' option is specified.

-p - if this option is specified then this utility will not display the
packets it sees from the specified authorized dhcp servers.

-a - if this option is specified the tool sends of alert message to
the list of names specified.

-i - this option specifies the alert frequency in seconds.

The format of the output will look like as below :

<time> (IP)<ipaddress offered> <packet type> (S)<server ip address> <***>

*** - indicates unauthorized server.

Examples :

17:34:58 (IP)0.0.0.0        NACK      (S)11.11.31.84         ***
17:36:38 (IP)11.101.190.130 OFFER     (S)11.101.12.226       ***

dhcpcmd:

This utility can be used as axillary tool to administrator DHCP servers.
The usage of this tool is as given below :

usage: dhcpcmd <server ip address> <command> [<command parameters>].
commands :
    1. AddIpRange
    2. AddReservedIp
    2. EnumClients
    3. MibCounts
    4. ServerConfig

Commands:

AddIpRange - can be used to add another ip range to an already existing
    scope.

    <parameters> - <scope address> <start ip range> <end ip range>

    Ex : dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 addiprange 11.101.0.0 11.101.4.1 11.101.4.254

AddReservedIp - can be used to add a reserved ip to an already existing
    scope.

    <parameters> - <scope address> <reserved ip> <hardware string>

    Example: dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 11.101.0.0 11.101.13.53 08002B30369B

EnumClients - can be used to list out the lease information in different
    format.

    <parameters> - <scope address> [ -v | -h]

    -v - this option will list out detailed lease information.

    -h - this option will list out lease information with hardware info.

    Example : dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 enumclients 11.101.0.0 -h

MibCounts - displays the current dhcp server statistic information.

ServerConfig - can be used to display current server parameters. Also
    used to set server parameters.

    <parameters> - <config parameter> <value>

    Examples :

        dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 serverconfig
            - displays current parameters.

        dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 serverconfig backupinterval 15
            - sets the database backup interval to 15 mins.

       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : DhcpExim
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this DhcpExim application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your DhcpExim application.

DhcpExim.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

DhcpExim.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CDhcpEximApp application class.

DhcpExim.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CDhcpEximApp.

DhcpExim.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Visual C++.

DhcpExim.clw
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.

res\DhcpExim.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file DhcpExim.rc.

res\DhcpExim.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 
	Visual C++.  You should place all resources not editable by
	the resource editor in this file.




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one dialog class:

DhcpEximDlg.h, DhcpEximDlg.cpp - the dialog
    These files contain your CDhcpEximDlg class.  This class defines
    the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's
    template is in DhcpExim.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft
	Visual C++.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named DhcpExim.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is 
in a language other than the operating system's current language, you
will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC42XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC42DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.
