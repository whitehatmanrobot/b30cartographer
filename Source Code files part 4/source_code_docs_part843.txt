several significant differences. Some of these are readily quantifiable, but some are not, and their precise aggregate effects are almost impossible to predict, as discussed below. Therefore, we recommend that you focus your Alpha-2 XDK development efforts primarily on learning to use the new, sophisticated graphics features of Microsoft  Direct3D  for Xbox. Performance work is best limited to order-of-magnitude evaluations using the guidelines below, with advanced optimization and detailed performance conclusions deferred until real Xbox consoles arrive. If you observe specific performance issues with the Xbox Alpha-2 XDK that concern you and aren t addressed by this paper, be aware that they may or may not be concerns on the actual Xbox hardware; please contact Xbox developer support to find out if and how they apply to Xbox. Functional differences Functionally, the Xbox Alpha-2 XDK platform and Xbox GPU are very similar. All the same shading and texturing capabilities are present, so programming that works on one will work on the other. However, there are a few differences. Memory is the most significant area of functional difference. Xbox is a unified memory architecture (UMA) machine, meaning the GPU shares the same memory as the CPU, MCP (media communications processor), and hard disk and DVD controllers, arbitrated by a single memory controller (which is in the Xbox GPU chip, along with the GPU). The Alpha-2 GPU, on the other hand, has a standard PC memory configuration, meaning that it has its own memory on a separate bus from that used by the CPU, to which it not only draws but in which it is most efficient to store textures and vertex buffers; thus, unlike Xbox, data provided by the CPU needs to be copied for optimal Alpha-2 GPU access. Consequently, memory allocation and management are normally very different on the two platforms. However, in the Alpha-2 XDK, the CPU and GPU do share one block of memory: AGP memory. To mask the differences between the platforms, the Alpha-2 XDK offers an AGP-based memory manager that emulates the final Xbox UMA system. However, this AGP-based emulation solution has some API controls and semantics (having to do with promotion of objects from AGP to video memory) that are meaningless for the Xbox GPU. These should be easy to remove from software when real Xbox consoles arrive; as we ll see below, the real impact of AGP-based UMA emulation is on performance. The primary Xbox output mode is composite/s-video 640 x 480 interlaced to a TV; obviously if the Alpha-2 XDK is run in a different mode or with a different output signal/device, there will be performance, memory footprint, and/or visual differences from Xbox. However, the Alpha-2 XDK is capable of outputting to a TV identically to Xbox. For VGA output, there is a hardware difference in that the Alpha-2 GPU provides 10-bit-per-color-component output precision from the gamma correction lookup table, while Xbox provides only 8 bits per color component. However, the the Alpha-2 XDK graphics driver will limit gamma entries to 8 bits of precision to match Xbox, so Alpha-2 XDK output should match Xbox on all devices in all modes. The Xbox GPU has higher quality decompression of DXTC1 textures than the Alpha-2 GPU. This results in fewer artifacts and better visual quality, so conclusions about whether or not DXTC1 is good enough for specific textures should not be reached based solely on the Alpha-2 XDK. The final functional difference is that the Xbox GPU supports 3-D textures for point sprites, while the Alpha-2 GPU does not. This enables games to effectively select among multiple 2-D textures stored within a 3-D texture on a point-sprite-by-point-sprite basis, simply by varying the r texture coordinate, a far more efficient way of switching point-sprite textures than doing normal texture selection. Performance differences Performance is the same for the Alpha-2 GPU and Xbox GPU in some but by no means all respects, especially memory performance and vertex shading. Before I discuss those, please note that the Xbox GPU runs at 250 MHz, with a 200 MHz memory bus. However, the initial Alpha-2 XDK systems are currently planned with the GPU running at only 225 MHz (the memory bus should still be at a full 200 MHz), due to silicon limitations; it may or may not be possible to upgrade these systems to full speed prior to the arrival of Xbox itself. (Note that these plans may well change depending on hardware availability.) This paper assumes that we re talking about an Alpha-2 GPU running at the same 250 MHz as the Xbox GPU; for slower versions, performance should scale roughly with clock speed. (However, the combination of full-speed memory and 90-percent-speed GPU would result in some degree of asymmetry: memory-bound operations would run as described below, but pipeline operations would slow down by ten percent.)  The single greatest (and least quantifiable) performance difference involves memory. As explained above, performance differs because of Xbox s UMA versus the Alpha-2 XDK s separate memory bus and chips, the greatest performance consequences of which stem from the Alpha-2 XDK s AGP emulation of UMA, for two reasons. First, AGP is much 5 to 10 times slower than Xbox s UMA memory, so the performance associated with any graphics objects accessed out of that memory (which include at a minimum all commands and vertex-buffer indices) will suffer to the extent that the slower accesses don t overlap with graphics pipeline processing. Second, the API for the Alpha-2 XDK will allow promotion of objects from AGP to video memory, where they will be able to run at full speed (we highly recommend that you promote textures and vertex buffers in order to get performance levels similar to Xbox), but that promotion will take a substantial amount of time that will vanish on Xbox. Note, however, that the command buffer will always be in AGP, and this will reduce performance somewhat relative to Xbox. Even apart from UMA emulation, Xbox s memory subsystem has significantly different performance characteristics from the Alpha-2 XDK. On Xbox the CPU, audio, and hard disk and DVD controllers access memory out of the same chips and via the same controller as the GPU, so the various bus masters will often contend for available memory bandwidth. In contrast, the Alpha-2 GPU won t encounter any contention, except when accessing AGP memory, and similarly the other bus masters won t have to contend with the Alpha-2 GPU, again apart from AGP accesses. The lack of contention will improve performance for both CPU and GPU on the Alpha-2 XDK, but the exact effect relative to Xbox is dependent on memory access patterns, which vary from game to game and from module to module within a game. Also, both latency and available bandwidth depend on the type and organization of the memory that the CPU and GPU access. In Xbox, the single UMA memory pool is 64 MB of 200 MHz 128-bit DDR, capable of 6.4 GB/s. For its separate memory space, the Alpha-2 GPU has the same memory type and architecture as the Xbox GPU, although it will have more available bandwidth and different memory controller strategies because it doesn t have to share bandwidth with other bus masters, which can take up to roughly 1 GB/s out of 6.4 GB/s total on Xbox. The bottom line is that, apart from the impact of UMA emulation, maximum Alpha-2 GPU memory performance should be similar to but somewhat faster than Xbox, on the order of up to 15 percent, but the performance relative to Xbox on any particular graphics rendering task will vary greatly depending on how memory-intensive the rendering is and on how much bandwidth other bus masters need. (It is possible that the Alpha-2 XDK may run the memory bus at a reduced speed, due to silicon limitations; this discussion assumes a full-speed memory bus. For sub-200-MHz memory, memory performance would scale roughly with memory bus clock speed.) The difference between the Alpha-2 XDK and Xbox is greater for CPU memory performance. In the Alpha-2 XDK, the CPU not only doesn t contend with the GPU for memory bandwidth, but it also has standard PC memory, with totally different performance characteristics from Xbox. The memory performance differences should be muted somewhat by the CPU s L2 cache, but here again there s a significant difference: the Alpha-2 XDK will have a 733-MHz CPU with a 256KB L2 cache, while Xbox will have a 733-MHz CPU with only a 128KB L2 cache. Consequently, the CPU will certainly not have the same memory performance characteristics on the two platforms, and the nature and extent of the differences will vary greatly depending on access patterns. The bottom line on memory-related performance differences is that you should wait for real Xbox consoles before attempting advanced performance tuning involving memory layout and access patterns of CPU and/or GPU data structures. Another significant performance difference is in the T&L part of the graphics pipeline. The Xbox GPU is capable of doing vertex shading up to twice as fast as the Alpha-2 GPU, and also has a maximum triangle rate 2.5 times as fast as the Alpha-2 GPU 125 Mtris/s compared to 50 Mtris/s. (Note that these are peak rates, achievable only with a limited set of shading attributes, and that triangle rates will drop from these levels as triangles get larger and fill rate affects performance more. As the next paragraph indicates, the performance drop will probably be larger on Xbox, because it has the same fill rate as the Alpha-2 XDK. Also note that achieving these triangle rates requires careful mesh optimization, both to minimize memory access costs and to make efficient use of the post-T&L vertex cache, so that the T&L work for each vertex can be amortized over several triangles.) One implication of the T&L difference between the two platforms is that mesh optimizations using tristrips with degenerate triangles are considerably more effective on Xbox than on the Alpha-2 XDK. Another is that larger numbers of triangles are possible on Xbox, but since there s no corresponding increase in fill rate, triangle size may have to shrink as number of triangles increases. Also, note that the impact of T&L pipeline performance differences between the two platforms will decrease proportionally to the extent to which T&L can overlap with vertex fetching and/or pixel shader processing, and will also vary depending on the type of T&L being performed (programmable or not, as well as number and type of lights and attributes), so there is no linear performance delta between Xbox and the Alpha-2 XDK. Finally, the effective size of the post-T&L vertex cache is 21 on the Alpha-2 XDK, but only 18 on Xbox, so transformed-and-lit vertices are evicted from the cache sooner on Xbox. Thus you should not use the Alpha-2 XDK to reach conclusions about maximum triangle rates or the best ways to optimize meshes, and should generally defer advanced triangle and vertex optimization until real Xbox hardware is available. Note that while the pixel shaders (as opposed to the vertex shaders discussed above) of the Alpha-2 XDK and Xbox GPU have identical per-clock fill rates, real-world pixel-shader performance is heavily dependent on memory performance for fetching triangles and vertices, fetching textures, and reading and writing the z and frame buffers. Given the differences between the Alpha-2 XDK and Xbox memory subsystems discussed earlier, actual fill rates may differ substantially between the two platforms. Another performance difference is that the accelerated occlusion-detection circuitry doesn t work with 16-bit z-buffers on the Alpha-2 XDK, but does work on Xbox. Similarly, the accelerated occlusion-detected circuitry is disabled in multisampled antialiasing modes on the Alpha-2 XDK, but should work on Xbox. Thus performance with 16-bit z-buffers and with multisampled antialiasing should be better on Xbox, at least for scenes with significant depth complexity. The final performance difference is that Xbox has only half the maximum palettized texture decompression rate of the Alpha-2 XDK, which can result in a pixel-shader slowdown when using palettized textures of as much as 2x relative to XDKA-2. The slowdown won t generally be this large the pixel shader will only slow down on texture cache misses, which become less frequent, for example, as textures become more magnified. Also, any palette-related slowdown may be partly or totally hidden by other pipeline processing such as register combiner processing, vertex shader processing, and memory fetches and writes, depending on what performance level other parts of the pipeline are configured for, on triangle size, and on memory access patterns. The bottom line, however, is that palettized textures will often be slower on Xbox than on the Alpha-2 XDK. As a final note, here s a quick listing of how various bottlenecks will change as you go from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox. It is important to note that the following discussion applies directly only to the full-speed Alpha-2 XDK system, running the GPU at the same 250 MHz as Xbox and the memory controller at the same 200 MHz as Xbox. The GPU performance of non-full-speed versions should be slower by a factor of roughly GPU-clock-speed/250, and the memory performance should scale roughly as memory-clock-speed/200. Further details will be provided when actual silicon is available. If your game is CPU limited, you will see no difference from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox. If your game is CPU memory limited, it might speed up a little from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox because of more efficient memory access by the CPU on Xbox, but it might slow down a little from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox because Xbox has a smaller L2 cache, so scaling will vary on a case-by-case basis. If your game is T&L limited, it will get faster from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox, by as much as 2 times.  If your game is triangle setup limited, it will get faster from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox, by as much as 2.5 times.  If your game is pipeline fill-rate limited, you will see no change from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox. If your game is GPU memory bandwidth limited (that is, fetching of vertices, triangles, textures, push-buffers, and pixel and depth buffer reads and writes), you will see either no change or some degree of slowdown (up to about 15 percent) from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox. If your game does a lot of loading of new graphics structures or procedural generation of new graphics structures that is, to the extent that new data is stored in memory for the GPU to use it will get faster from the Alpha-2 XDK to Xbox, because AGP will no longer be in the loop.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Texture addressing range with wrap TitleTexture addressing range with wrap mikeab Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0Texcoord Range Issues Interpolated floating-point texcoords s and t (and, for 3-D textures, r) ultimately map to coordinates within texture maps. (A number of texture address ops use texcoords for other purposes, such as calculating dot products, but here we re talking specifically about looking up texels.) The mapping from texcoords to texels can occur in any of several ways, depending primarily on the texture address mode. (The mapping also depends on whether projective textures are enabled; projective textures have an additional step, where in which s, t, and r are divided by q, after which the texture-addressing process is the same as the non-projective case. From now on we ll discuss only the non-projective case, bearing in mind that the projective case behaves the same way after the initial division by q.) The exact mechanics of the texture address modes are will be discussed in a future white paper<TBW>; this paper will focus on the fact that some of the mappings work properly for all texcoord values, but others work well only within a certain range. The following texture address modes work correctly for all texcoord values: D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP, D3DTADDRESS_BORDER, and D3DTADDRESS_CLAMPTOEDGE. Due to inherent limitations of single-precision IEEE floats, the D3DTADDRESS_WRAP texture address mode produces correct output for only a subrange of texcoord values, so wrap mode requires some alertness on the part of the programmer, particularly when rendering large tiled surfaces, such as terrain. Wrap mode effectively uses x-floor(x)  as the working texcoord, which is handy for tiling textures, but unlike clamp doesn t work for arbitrarily large texcoords. The problem is that floating-point values have only 24 bits of precision, and as texcoords get larger, those 24 bits shift up to larger magnitudes, leaving fewer and fewer significant bits down below the 1.0 magnitude where they re needed for generating the working, post-wrap texcoord, in the range (0,1), with sufficient precision not only to address each texel, but also enough additional precision to support the sub-texel precision (roughly 8 bits) needed for high visual quality. The result is that as wrapped texcoords get larger, texel addressing gets less and less precise. Up to a point, this isn t noticeable, but eventually it causes textures to wiggle and shift, and in the limit (when all bits of the floating-point mantissa are of too great a magnitude to affect the post-wrap texcoord) all texcoords turn into 0 and the texture effectively becomes a constant color whatever color the texel at the texture origin happens to be. So what s the largest acceptable size for a wrapping texcoord? The range that provides high image quality under all circumstances is as follows: = 2^16 / texture_dimension high-quality range = ( -r,r) where texture_dimension is the texture size along the dimension of interest (height, width, or depth). Here s the range table for wrapped texcoords for a variety of texture sizes, with high-quality under all circumstances: texture_dimension range (not inclusive) -]128 -]256 -]512 -]1024 -]2048 -]4096 -]8192 -]16384 -]32768 Note that texture mapping doesn t fall apart completely the instant any of these limits are exceeded. To the contrary, image degradation occurs gradually, and may initially only be visible on close inspection or with highly magnified textures. The greater the margin by which the limits are exceeded, however, the more apparent the degradation will be. Acceptable image quality under most circumstances (particularly if textures aren t magnified much) can be achieved with: = 2^20 / texture_dimension acceptable-quality range = ( -ra,ra) One exception to the above equations: coordinates with magnitude greater than or equal to 2^23 will always produce a constant texture address. So, for example, if both coordinates (or all three, for 3-D textures) are 2^23 or greater, the texture output will be a constant color. The final texture addressing mode, D3DTADDRESS_MIRROR, has the same behavior with respect to size as D3DTADDRESS_WRAP, and hence the recommended range equation above applies to mirroring as well as wrapping.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8There Are No Xbox GPU Performance Counters TitleThere Are No Xbox GPU Performance Counters mikeab Normal.dot a-daunr Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU There Are No Xbox GPU Performance Counters The Xbox Alpha-2 GPU contains a set of performance counters that can track a variety of GPU hardware operations, ranging from texture and vertex cache misses to the number of pixels rejected by occlusion testing. These counters are potentially very useful for fine-tuning Xbox apps. At Xfest, we stated that these counters would be available in the final hardware for the Xbox itoring will be implemented in the final Xbox hardware, for the simple reason that it is not implemented in the silicon of the final Xbox GPU. We recognize that this is a significant loss for performance tuning, but there s nothing that can be done about it at this point. s worth noting that we could implement hardware performance monitoring on the Alpha-2 GPUs. However, it s not clear whether that would be worthwhile. The problem is that the Alpha-2 systems differ from the final Xbox in significant ways, including memory bandwidth, clock speed, vertex shading speed, triangle setup speed, and effective size of the post-T&L cache, so it s not clear how relevant to Xbox any stats gathered on an Alpha-2 GPU would be. Also, the Alpha-2 software will be frozen as soon as the final hardware is available, so not too long after that it will not be easy or perhaps even possible to run Xbox games on the Alpha-2 platform for performance monitoring purposes. We are currently investigating this; your input is welcome.

Vertex shaders are simple assembly-level programs for an idealized vertex processor. The shader author writes to the idealized processor, and DirectX takes care of interpreting the shader. On some (PC-based) DirectX systems, the shader might be converted to x86 machine code. On others, it might be converted to microcode for some form of programmable ver  vertex processing unit executes a superset of the DirectX 8.0 vertex shader instruction set. The full power of this processing unit has been exposed in the Xbox DirectX libraries. This paper gives a detailed description of the Xbox GPU s vertex shader processor, along with tips for programming it. The Xbox GPU vertex shader processor has the following features: Registers All registers have four single precision floating point components. 16 input registers: v0 through v15. 12 temporary registers: r0 through r11. r12 is a special read-only 13th temporary register that shadows output register oPos. 192 constant registers: c 96 through c95. One address register: a0.x, used for indirect addressing when reading from constant registers. 11 output registers: the normal DirectX 8.0 ones, plus oB0 and oB1, which are the back face versions of oD0 and oD1. Instructions Shader operations 13 MAC (multiply-accumulate) opcodes 7 ILU (inverse logic unit) opcodes 136 microcode instructions. Each instruction can: Read from three registers with optional swizzle and negation. Compute one MAC operation and one ILU operation. Write to up to one output register and two temporary registers with optional component masking. Shader types Normal vertex shaders Read/write vertex shaders Vertex state shaders Timing The cycle speed is 233 MHz. For normal vertex shaders, instructions take between one-half cycle and one cycle to complete. For read/write and vertex state shaders, instructions take between one cycle and six cycles to complete.

Input B is used by all MAC instructions except mov, arl, and add. Input C is used by MAC instructions add and mad, and by all ILU instructions. Operations: Up to two operations can be performed in each instruction. One operation must be a MAC operation, and the other must be an ILU operation. The mov operation can be either a MAC operation or an ILU operation. (Except for mov a0.x, which must be a MAC operation.) There are 136 instruction slots. Shader execution can start at any specified slot, and continues until an instruction is encountered that has the eos bit set. Output: The output of an operation can be written to both an r register and to an output (o or c) register. In a paired instruction: Only one of the two operations can write to an output register. The MAC operation can t write to r1. (If it tries to, the write will be ignored.) The only r register the ILU operation can write to is r1. An example of a paired instruction that writes to multiple outputs: mul r2,r1,c0        ; MAC operation, writes to r register + mul oPos,r1,c0    ; same operation, writes to an o register + rsq r1.w,v0       ; ILU operation, writes to r1. Instruction Categories This table shows which instructions are executed by which logic units. It also shows which instructions use which inputs. Instruction Comments Internal name for mov a0.x scalar, uses C.x not C.w Internal name for mov that uses ILU scalar, uses C.x not C.w scalar, uses C.x not C.w scalar, uses C.x not C.w scalar, uses C.x not C.w Beware of Scalar ILU Instructions Although the microcode instructions are almost a perfect match with the DirectX vertex shader instructions, there is one subtle difference in the way scalar ILU instructions are implemented. The DirectX vertex shader language specifies that the exp, log, rcc, rcp, and rsq instructions all operate on the   component of the input. But the microcode versions of these instructions actually operate on the   component of the input. This has subtle implications. For example, you might think you could pair these two instructions: add oPos, v0, c0 +rsq r1, c0          ;can t be paired, swizzles conflict But in fact, you can t, because the add instruction requires that the c input s x component hold the value c0.x, while the rsq instruction requires that the c input s x component hold the value c0.w. You could pair these two instructions if the rsq instruction was written  rsq r1, c0.x Single-Threading Versus Multi-Threading Normal vertex shaders run multi-threaded. There are two copies of the vertex shader pipeline, and each copy can run up to three threads. Therefore, a total of six threads can be active at once. When three threads are run on a pipeline, each thread s instructions are executed once every third cycle. Read/write vertex shaders and vertex state shaders run single threaded, on a single pipeline. Even though instructions are executed up to three times more often, single-threaded shaders are inherently slower than multi-threaded shaders, for two reasons: Only one of the two vertex shader pipelines is used. As you will see in the next section, multi-threading reduces the cost of stalling. Stalling All inputs to an instruction must be ready before an instruction can start. If the inputs are not ready, the instruction stalls until the inputs are available. Instructions normally take six cycles to compute their outputs. There are three special  bypass  cases: the ALU, ILU, and MLU bypasses. When you chain together certain sequences of instructions, the result of an instruction is ready for future instructions to use after only three cycles. The bypass path allows swizzling and negation of the result. See the Bypass Details section, below, for more information. Multi-threading reduces the cost of a stall because each thread tries only to start a new instruction every three cycles. Once started, a multi-threaded instruction still completes in six cycles. This effectively divides the stall penalties by three. In the following table,  Register Type  is the type of the register that appears as an input to the instruction. A stall occurs if the number of cycles between the instruction that last wrote to the register and the first instruction that reads from the register is less than the number of cycles listed under  Effective Stall. Register Type Effective Stall Rules 1 thread 3 threads +0.16 3 threads version stalls 0.5 cycles every third vertex, 0.5 / 3 = 1 / 6 = 0.16666.  Never stalls. ALU, ILU, and MLU bypass. See Bypass Details section below. All other cases. The memory is divided into two sections based on address bit 2, into blocks of four constants. Writing a section and then reading it causes a stall. The sections are interleaved (odd blocks of four and even blocks of four). t read from an output register, except for oPos, which is treated as if it were r12. Stalling Notes In the single-threaded case, a thread can have up to six instructions in flight at once. When starting a new instruction, the previous five instructions must be considered when calculating whether the new instruction will stall: xvsw.1.1 rcp r0,v0      ;1 cycle, starts writing to r0 rcp oPos,r0    ;stalls for 5 cycles, waiting for r0 xvsw.1.1  rcp r0,v0      ;1 cycle starts writing to r0 mov r1,v1      ;1 cycle mov r2,v2      ;1 cycle mov r3,v3      ;1 cycle mov r4,v4      ;1 cycle rcp oPos,r0    ;stalls for 1 cycle, waiting for r0 In the single-threaded case, when writing to a constant register toward the end of a shader, the potential for stalling lasts beyond the end of the shader, to the first few instructions of the next cycle of the same shader. xvsw.1.1  rcp r0,c0      ;1 cycle first iteration, 6 cycles on    ;subsequent iterations ; ... body of shader omitted ... rcp c0,r0      ;Last instruction of shader, causes stall of    ;the first instruction on the next iteration For the multi-threaded case, a thread can have only two instructions in flight at once. When starting a new instruction, only the previous instruction in that thread needs to be considered. xvs.1.1 rcp r0,v0    ;1 cycle rcp r1,r0    ;stalls for 1 cycle, waiting for r0 For the multi-threaded case, the last instruction of the shader program can t stall the first instruction of the next iteration of the shader. Stalls are tracked on a per-component basis. So, for example, there is no stall between these two instructions: rcp r0.x,v0 rcp oPos,r0.y   ;r0.y is a different component than r0.x Bypass Details The ALU, ILU, and MLU bypass paths allow some instruction sequences to execute more quickly than normal. However, there are numerous restrictions: 1) In order to use the ALU bypass, the source instruction must use the ALU. It s OK if the source instruction also uses the MLU as part of their process, such as dp4. The destination instruction has to be either the add or mad instruction, and the result of the source instruction must only be used on the C input. (In other words, only as the final argument to the add or mad instruction.) A common sequence would be mad,mad,mad,add for implementing a transposed matrix multiply. 2) In order to use the ILU bypass, the source instruction must use the ILU. The destination instruction has to be either the add or mad instruction, and the result of the source instruction must only be used on the C input. (In other words, only as the final argument to the add or mad instruction.) An example sequence would be rsq, add. 3) In order for to use the MLU bypass, the source instruction must use the MLU, but not the ALU. An example would be the mul instruction. It doesn t work on source instructions that don t use the MLU, such as rsq, and it doesn t work on source instructions that also use the ALU, such as dp3. Any instruction can be used as the destination instruction. An example sequence would be mul, rsq. 4) The bypass paths allow the results of an instruction to be used as inputs to a new instruction after exactly three cycles. If for some reason the new instruction is not ready to start after three cycles, the opportunity to bypass is lost, and the result won t be ready until six cycles have elapsed, even if all the other inputs are available on the fourth cycle. For example: xvss.1.1              ; Vertex state shader rsq r0.y,v0           ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.x,v1,c0        ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.x,r0,r0        ; 3 cycles, only r0.x is read, MLU bypass works xvss.1.1              ; Vertex state shader rsq r0.y,v0           ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.x,v1,c0        ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.y,r0,r0        ; 4 cycles, only r0.y is read, must wait for rsq                       ; to complete xvss.1.1              ; Vertex state shader rsq r0,v0             ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.x,v1,c0        ; 1 cycle, no stall mul r0.xy,r0,r0       ; 6 cycles. r0.xy are read. Missed bypass chance     ; because must wait for rsq to complete. Then,     ; must wait for non-bypass mul r0.x to complete. Additional Stalls We have performed extensive timings of normal vertex shaders on actual Xbox hardware and have discovered several additional sources of stalls. The following information is for normal (vs and xvs) shaders. We have not yet measured real-world stalls for other kinds (xvss and xvsw) of vertex shaders. Minimum Shader Time Vertex Shaders Take at Least 2.2 Cycles Vertex Shaders have a 2.2-cycle minimum length. Some five-instruction vertex shaders will take 2.7 cycles instead of the expected 2.5 cycles. Writing to n Output Registers Takes n Cycles If you write to n unique output registers during the course of your vertex shader, it will take a minimum of n cycles to execute the shader. This means a simple pass-thru vertex shader, that just copies the input registers to the output registers, can take effectively double the expected time to execute.  Writing to one component of an output register in one instruction, and then later writing to a different component of the same register in a separate instruction, counts as only one unique register write for the purposes of this stall. Special Situation Stalls Reading from Temporary Registers During the First Two Instructions of a Vertex Shader Will Stall If you read from the results of the first instruction during the second instruction, it will stall between .75 and 1.5 cycles (.75 for a four-instruction shader, moving to 1.5 cycles for anything larger than nine instructions).  If you read from an uninitialized register in the first instruction (for instance, reading from r12 to get a free 1.0 or 0.0), it will stall between 1.5 and 2.5 cycles (2.5, if your shader is six or more instructions). If you read an uninitialized register on the second instruction, it will stall 0.63 cycles.  On shaders of seven or fewer cycles, reading from a temporary register on the third instruction will stall 0.1 cycles. Example: xvs.1.1 dp4 r2, v0, c0 add oD0, c2.y, r2 // Since this is the second instruction, // reading from r*, it will stall 1.5 cycles, // even though it theoretically shouldn t stall // at all. Dependent Instructions Can Cause Stalls If you have three instructions in a row, where the second relies on the result of the first, and the third relies on the result of the second, the vertex shader will stall an extra 0.5 cycles, or even up to one full cycle, based on the location of the three instructions in the vertex shader, the length of the vertex shader, and the types of instructions used. Some rules for determining how long this extra stall will take: If there would normally be no stall on the second and third instructions (if they rely on bypasses), this extra stall will not happen. If the second instruction would stall, but the third uses the bypass: If the shader is between five and nine instructions, or if the three-instruction set begins on the third, fifth, or seventh cycle, it will stall an extra 0.2 cycles  Otherwise, it will stall an extra 1/3 to 2/3 of a cycle. (The stall-to-bypass combo will always stall between 1/6 and 2/3 of a cycle extra.) If the second uses a bypass, but the third does not: It will always stall an extra 0.16 or 0.33 cycles (usually 0.33), unless The three-instruction group starts on the second instruction, in which case it will stall between 0.0 and 0.16, or The three-instruction group starts on the sixth or seventh instruction, in which case it will take about 0.22 cycles. If neither instruction uses a bypass, meaning the second and third instructions stall: If your shader is 10 or fewer cycles in length, this extra stall probably won t happen. Otherwise, if the three-instruction group starts on the third or fifth cycle, it will stall between 0.5 and 1.0 cycles, at random (averaging about .8).  Otherwise, the three instructions will stall about 0.5 cycles, or occasionally 0.66, 0.75 or 1.0, but averaging .55. Example: xvs.1.1 #pragma screenspace rcp r4, v6.x mad r1, r4, c91, c91 //Should be a .5-cycle stall here. dp4 oPos, r4, r1 //Should be a .5-cycle stall here. This program should theoretically take 6.5 cycles, but will instead take between 7.2 and 7.5 cycles. Cascading Stalls If one instruction stalls, and the results of that instruction are used two instructions later, that instruction will stall between 0.33 and 0.5 cycles (usually 0.5, averaging 0.44). Example: dp3 r4, c0, v0 max r4, r4, -r4   // This stalls 0.5 cycles. mad oPos, v1, r4.w, c15   // This stalls between 0.33 and 0.5 cycles. If the four-instruction block begins on the second, third, or fourth cycle of a vertex shader, and the shader is less than 30 cycles, the stall will be lessened: somewhere between 0.0 cycles and .37 cycles of stall. Example: xvs.1.1 #pragma screenspace dp3 r4, c0, v0 max r4, r4, -r4 //This stalls 0.5 cycles (expected). mad oPos, v1, r4.w, c15  //This stalls 0.5 cycles (not expected!). This program should theoretically take 6.5 cycles, but instead takes 7.0 cycles. Inserting an extra nop between the max and mad will prevent this stall. Moving the dp3 back an instruction would also remove the extra stall. Index Register Write/Read Stall Reading from a0.x in the instruction after you write to it will stall 1/6th of a cycle. Example: mov a0.x, c0 mov oPos, [a0.x + 5] // Whole shader should take 3.0 cycles, instead takes 3.16 cycles. The Eighth Cycle Stretch If a stall occurs on the eighth cycle, it can get slightly stretched and stall 0.6 cycles instead of 0.5 cycles. This happens about 40 percent of the time. The oPos to Screen Space Transformation For normal vertex shaders, the xsasm assembler automatically appends the following instructions onto the end of the vertex shader: mul oPos.xyz, r12, c-38 ; scale + rcc r1.x, r12.w       ; compute 1/w mad oPos.xyz, r12, r1.x, c-37 ; scale by 1/w, add offset These instructions transform the vertex position from homogenous space into screen space. As you can see, these instructions simply perform a scale, perspective divide, and offset. Examining these instructions, we see the use of r12 to read back the current value of oPos. You can use this technique in your own code if you want to. It allows you to treat oPos as a thirteenth temporary register. There s no performance penalty to doing this. There s no requirement that these instructions be the final instructions of the vertex shader. And, in fact, the xsasm optimizer will often move the mul/rcc pair up, to avoid the stall between the rcc and the mad. Depending upon how your shader computes oPos, you may be able to save some cycles by merging these three instructions with other calculations that you re already doing. If this is the case, you can use the  #pragma screenspace  statement to tell xsasm to not append these three instructions. #pragma screenspace only affects how the shader microcode is generated. It doesn t tell Microsoft  Direct3D  to stop generating values for registers c-37 and c-38. If want to use registers c-37 and c-38 for your own purposes, you must call Direct3D::SetShaderConstantMode with the D3DSCM_NORESERVEDCONSTANTS flag. This flag prevents Direct3D from modifying registers c-37 and c-38. Calculating the Screen Space Scale and Offset Parameters DirectX calculates the scale and offset values from the arguments to the Direct3DDevice::SetViewport call. If you calculate these values on your own, you must first transform the x, y, and z values into screen space, and then make adjustments. Screen space means: 0 <= x < width (in pixels) 0 <= y < height (in pixels) 0 <= z <= D3DZ_MAX_D16, D3DZ_MAX_D24S8, D3DZ_MAX_F16, or D3DZ_MAX_F24S8, depending upon the depth buffer format. The adjustment table: D3DMULTISAMPLE_TYPE Scale Offset D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE 0.53125 0.53125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_LINEAR 0.03125 0.03125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_QUINCUNX 0.03125 0.03125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES_SUPERSAMPLE_HORIZONTAL_LINEAR 0.53125 0.53125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES_SUPERSAMPLE_VERTICAL_LINEAR 0.53125 0.53125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_LINEAR 0.03125 0.03125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_GAUSSIAN 0.03125 0.03125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_SUPERSAMPLE_LINEAR 0.53125 0.53125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_SUPERSAMPLE_GAUSSIAN 0.53125 0.53125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_9_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_GAUSSIAN 0.03125 0.03125 D3DMULTISAMPLE_9_SAMPLES_SUPERSAMPLE_GAUSSIAN 0.53125 0.53125 The offset value of 0.53125 is 0.5 + 1/32. The number 0.5 is the difference between the OpenGL pixel center rasterization rules and the Direct3D rasterization rules. Adding 1/32 implements rounding to the nearest 1/16 of a pixel. The offset of 0.5 is not used when multisampling. From this table you can see that the D3DMULTISAMPLE_9_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_GAUSSIAN mode is actually implemented by the hardware as a four-sample multi-sample followed by a 1.5   1.5 super-sample. A Vertex Shader Optimization Case Study Say you have four lights, and you want to compute the four normalized difference vectors between the vertex and four lights. You might write the code as follows: add r4,-r9,c10 ; r9 is the vertex position                ; c10 is light 0 s position dp3 r4.w,r4,r4 ; normalize rsq r4.w,r4.w mul r4,r4,r4.w add r5,-r9,c11 ; light 1 dp3 r5.w,r5,r5 rsq r5.w,r5.w mul r5,r5,r5.w add r6,-r9,c12 ; light 2 dp3 r6.w,r6,r6 rsq r6.w,r6.w mul r6,r6,r6.w add r7,-r9,c13 ; light 3 dp3 r7.w,r7,r7 rsq r7.w,r7.w mul r7,r7,r7.w This code is 16 instructions long, but because of stalls, this code takes a total of 4   7 = 28 cycles to execute. The first optimization is to reorder the instructions to eliminate stalls. This is easy to do because there are plenty of temporary registers to hold the intermediate results: add r4,-r9,c10 add r5,-r9,c11 add r6,-r9,c12 add r7,-r9,c13 dp3 r4.w,r4,r4 dp3 r5.w,r5,r5 dp3 r6.w,r6,r6 dp3 r7.w,r7,r7 rsq r4.w,r4.w rsq r5.w,r5.w rsq r6.w,r6.w rsq r7.w,r7.w mul r4,r4,r4.w mul r5,r5,r5.w mul r6,r6,r6.w mul r7,r7,r7.w This new code has no stalls in it. Each instruction will run immediately, because all of its input data is already available. This sequence of instructions will take 16 cycles to execute, quite an improvement over the original 28 cycles. But wait, there s more: The four rsq instructions can be paired with the nearby MLU instructions. To do this, we have to rewrite the code so that the rsq instructions write to the r1 register. Write masks can be used to allow r1 to hold up to four different scalar values. add r4,-r9,c10 add r5,-r9,c11 add r6,-r9,c12 add r7,-r9,c13 dp3 r4.w,r4,r4 dp3 r5.w,r5,r5 dp3 r6.w,r6,r6 +   rsq r1.x,r4.w       ; paired with previous instruction dp3 r7.w,r7,r7 +   rsq r1.y,r5.w       ; paired with previous instruction mul r4,r4,r1.x +   rsq r1.x,r6.w       ; paired with previous instruction mul r5,r5,r1.y +   rsq r1.y,r7.w       ; paired with previous instruction mul r6,r6,r1.x mul r7,r7,r1.y This code has the same effect as the original code but takes only 12 cycles to execute. Finally, if this code is part of a longer sequence, there are still eight potential slots for instruction pairing. The four slots associated with the add instructions are not very useful, because they are restricted to using the add instruction s last argument as their input. But the other four slots (for the first two dp3 instructions, and the last two mul instructions) are potentially useful. One common use of such free slots is to use the mov instruction to copy data from an input register to an output register. For example, if this shader wanted to pass texture coordinates through to the pixel shader, it could use the following pairing: dp3 r5.w,r5,r5 +   mov oT0,v7         ; paired with previous instruction Hand-Optimization Tips All the normal DirectX 8.0 vertex shader optimization tips still apply. Shorter shaders usually execute in less time than longer shaders. In addition, these special rules apply to the Xbox GPU vertex shader: Use the xsasm assembler to help you optimize. Have it optimize your code, and then examine the listing output to see if you can do even better by hand. To avoid stalls in normal shaders, try not to use the output of an instruction for at least one instruction. Sometimes swapping the order of arguments to an add instruction will avoid a stall, by enabling the ALU or ILU bypass paths. Try to make r1 the target of all ILU instructions that write to r registers, so that they can be paired. This includes mov instructions that write to r registers.  Sometimes it s useful to write a result to both an r register and an output register. Because all instructions take the same time to execute, consider upgrading weaker instructions into more powerful instructions. For example, a mul is no more expensive than a mov. And a mad is no more expensive than a mul or an add. Sometimes this allows you to get an extra effect  for free Some instructions compute four separate results at once. These instructions are add, mul, mad, min, max, sge, and slt. With these instructions it s just as cheap to compute four results as one. For example, in lighting calculations the max instruction is often used to clamp a light s intensity to a positive value. When multiple lights are being calculated, you can batch four lights  intensities into the four components of a temporary register, and then use a single max instruction to clamp all four lights  intensities. This saves three max instructions for every four lights. (See the VSLights sample for details.)  The following tips rely on little-known features of normal vertex shaders which are also present in the Xbox GPU hardware: Rely on the w component of output registers being pre-initialized to 1.0f. You don't need to merge in a "1.0" before writing to an output register. Just write to the output register using an .xyz mask. Rely on the hardware automatically clamping the oD0, oD1, oB0, and 0B1 components to the range [0.0..1.0]. Rely on the hardware automatically clamping oFog in the following way: oFog is interpolated based upon the unclamped value you write. The interpolated fog value is clamped to a legal fog table index value at the time it s used. (i.e. the oFog clamping is done for each output pixel color computation, not just for the three vertices of the triangle.)

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Texture wrap modes TitleTexture wrap modes mikeab Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0QFA}LXbox Texture Addressing Modes The other day, I had to go pick up a friend at the bus station in Springfield. I d never been to Springfield, much less the bus station, and I didn t have a map of the city, but no problem, I figured d just print out a map from Yahoo before I left. And, in fact, that s what I did. The map contained the following instructions: Merge onto I-91 N. I-91 becomes I-91 N/US-5. Stay straight to go onto I-91 N. Take the exit. Unfortunately, it didn t say which exit, so I guessed it was the exit immediately after I-91 split off from US-5. Bad guess. It turned out that I had the wrong exit by about 2 miles, and was treated to an extended tour of the wrong side of the tracks as a result. As you can see, getting your mappings right can be very important indeed. Which brings us, neat as a pin, to texture addressing modes. The version of Microsoft  Direct3D  for the Xbox  separately for each texture axis by calling IDirect3DDevice8::SetTextureStageState( stage, {D3DTSS_ADDRESSU | D3DTSS_ADDRESSV | D3DTSS_ADDRESSW}, texture_addressing_mode) where the second parameter selects the texture axis for which the mode is to be set. The full set of available texture addressing modes consists of D3DTADDRESS_WRAP D3DTADDRESS_MIRROR D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP D3DTADDRESS_BORDER D3DTADDRESS_CLAMPTOEDGE The first four are standard Direct3D texture addressing modes; the fifth, clamp-to-edge, is an Xbox extension. Note that D3DTADDRESS_MIRRORONCE is not available on Xbox, since the hardware doesn t support it. These modes are discussed in detail below. Each pixel drawn with texturing enabled has associated texture coordinates that specify the point at which to sample the texture. (There may of course be multiple textures and sets of texture coordinates per pixel, but we ll discuss only the one-texture case here.) The texture is sampled via a filter, which may be point-sampled, bilinear, trilinear, quadrilinear (for 3-D textures only), or anisotropic (for 2-D textures only). Depending on the filter, anywhere from 1 to 64 texels may be read from the texture and filtered together to produce the final filter value; in all cases except point-sampled, filters span multiple texels. Whenever texture coordinates are located so that part of the texture filter lies outside the texture, there is a question of what sample values should be read by that filter, since without some sort of intervention, the filter will attempt to read nonexistent texels. (Note that a bilinear filter centered at (0,0) will sample off the top and left edges of the texture, because the filter reads a 2 x 2 block of texels, so this can be an issue even for texture coordinates that are on the texture but near the edge.) The answer is determined by the selected texture addressing mode, which can cause texture sampling to be wrapped, mirrored, clamped in either of two ways, or free to float around the texture and a surrounding border, as we ll discuss shortly. First, however, we need to establish some terminology and basic concepts. Texture addressing coordinate spaces s start by defining the texture coordinate spaces. For swizzled and compressed textures (but not image that is, linear textures, as discussed below), texture addressing is as follows. (This is a 2-D texture, and this paper will directly discuss only 2-D except as otherwise noted, but the 1-D and 3-D cases are straightforward extensions, involving applying the same principles to either one axis or three axes.) The coordinates that are associated with vertices (either by being in the vertex data structure or as a result of texture generation in the vertex shader) are s and t values (and r for 3-D textures), which range from 0 to 1 across the width and height of the texture, respectively. (Properly speaking, it  and t  that range from 0 to 1 across the texture, where s  = s/q and t  = t/q (and r  = r/q for 3-D textures). However, q is 1 in all cases except projected textures, so for simplicity we re just going to use s and t instead of s  and t  throughout this paper (and r instead of r  for 3-D textures), with the understanding that for each pixel fragment using a projected texture, the texture coordinate in [0,1] space, which is referred to as (s,t) in this paper, is (s/q,t/q) rather than (s,t), after which everything works as usual.) The s and t texture coordinates are multiplied by the dimensions of the texture to yield u and v values (and p for 3-D textures), as follows: u = s *width v = t * height (p = r * depth for 3-D textures; from now on, I won t generally mention the third coordinate, but it s implied and works like the other two) where width and height are the width and height of the texture in texels. This scaling takes us from describing the texture with a coordinate system with range [0,1] along all axes to describing the texture with a coordinate system with ranges [0,width] and [0,height], mapping to one unit per texel. The u and v values are interpolated across the triangle, so each pixel fragment has an associated (u,v) texture coordinate. These (u,v) texture coordinates are eventually turned into one or more (  because of filtering, as discussed below) integer [i][j] texel coordinates (or [i][j][k] for 3-D textures), each of which uniquely specifies a texel. In short, s and t are unscaled coordinates that range from 0.0 to 1.0, u and v are scaled texture coordinates that run from 0.0 to width and height, and i and j are integral texel array coordinates; understanding this is key to understanding texture addressing. The i and j index scales will not be shown in figures from now on, to avoid cluttering the figures, but are implied since they are simply floor(u) and floor(v).  Note that the use of s, t, r, u, v, p, i, j, and k in this paper does not match the Direct3D documentation, which uses only u and v, and which uses them to mean what s and t mean in this paper. In fact, this paper s usage follows OpenGL conventions (with the exception of p, which OpenGL confusingly refers to by the same name as the fourth homogenous coordinate, w). I m diverging from Direct3D conventions (and to a small extent from OpenGL conventions as well) in the interests of clarity; it is difficult to properly describe texture addressing modes without scaled, unscaled, and integer texture coordinates, so I ve chosen to base this paper on conventions that account for all three texture coordinate ranges. Also note that, somewhat confusingly, vertex texture coordinates for image textures are specified directly in the texture-size-scaled (u,v) space. (It s swizzled and compressed textures that are, as described above, specified in unscaled (s,t) space and scaled into (u,v) space by the hardware.) Image-texture coordinates are required to be prescaled because the hardware would require a general multiplier to convert (s,t) to (u,v) for the non-power-of-two widths and heights of image textures; for other textures, width, height, and depth are a power of two, so the conversion can be done much more cheaply. Thus, for image textures only, the texture coordinates provided in vertex structures or generated in a vertex shader are what this paper refers to as u and v values. Note that projected image textures do work, although the texgen matrix has to be scaled up to account for u/q and v/q rather than s/q and t/q. Texture sampling Texture coordinates are interpolated across the texture in a perspective-correct fashion as a triangle is drawn, based on the vertex values, so each pixel fragment to be drawn has an associated (u,v) coordinate that describes a point to be sampled in the texture, which we will call the filter point. It is the (u,v) coordinates of the filter point and the filter that is in effect that together determine exactly which texels are read for a given filter point, as well as the way in which those texels are combined to form the filter value to be returned. A point-sampled filter returns the value of the texel that (u,v) lies within. One way to describe this is the equation: filter_value = texture[ifloor(u)][ifloor(v)] where ifloor() floors the value and returns it as an integer, and the texture[width][height] is the texture addressed as a two-dimensional array. Another is to view the texture as covered with 1 x 1 box filters, each exactly covering one texel and returning the value of that texel; in this case, the filter point selects a box filter to sample. For a 1-D texture, point-sampled filtering would look like this:  Each filter is shown in a different color, and a dotted line shows the center of the texel the filter applies to. A filter point at u = 1.75 is also shown; the value returned for this filter point is simply the value of the texel at i = 1. Note that the centers of texels are at n + 0.5, where n is the texel index in the array, and that the box filter covers the interval [n, n + 1). Yet another way to describe point-sampled filtering is with a figure: There are likewise several ways to view bilinear filtering, which basically returns a weighted average of up to four texels near the filter point, with the weighting inversely proportional to distance from the filter point. One way is to say that it generates four points which we ll call sample points from the filter point. (For comparison, each point-sampled filter has exactly one sample point, which is the same as the filter point.) The sample points are as follows: ul = u  ur = u + 0.5 vt = v  vb = v + 0.5 sample_point_1 = (ul,vt) sample_point_2 = (ul,vb) sample_point_3 = (ur,vt) sample_point_4 = (ur,vb) A bilinear filter reads four texels from those four sample points: sample_value_a = texture(ifloor(ul), ifloor(vt)) sample_value_b = texture(ifloor(ul), ifloor(vb)) sample_value_c = texture(ifloor(ur), ifloor(vt)) sample_value_d = texture(ifloor(ur), ifloor(vb)) determines four weights: wr = frac(u   0.5) wl = 1  wb = 1   frac(v   0.5) wt = 1  where frac(x) returns the fractional portion of the value (x   floor(x)), in the range [0,1), and then calculates: filter_value = wl * wt * sample_value_a + wl * wb * sample_value_b + wr * wt * sample_value_c + wr * wb * sample_value_d s kind of hard to visualize, however. Another, more intuitive, approach is to view the texture as covered with 2 x 2 pyramidal weighting ramps, each centered at the middle of a texel, with a value of 1 at the center sloping linearly down to 0 one texel away. The height of a pyramid at a given texture coordinate is the weighting to be given the associated texel at that texture coordinate. For a 1-D texture, linear filtering (not bilinear because there s only one filtering axis) would look like this: Each filter is shown in a different color, and a dotted line shows the center of the texel the filter applies to. A filter point at u = 1.75 is also shown; the value returned for this filter point would be: filter_value = 0.75 * texture(1) + 0.25 * texture(2). The 2-D case would be similar; with the filter point covered by up to four pyramids. To calculate the filter value for a (u,v) texture coordinate, the hardware evaluates the value of each pyramid at the filter point, and uses those values as weightings to combine the values of the texels associated with the pyramids. This is, of course, equivalent to the weightings in the equations above. Note that the sum of the weights is always 1.0, so the filter for a constant input is the same value, and the image is not darkened or lightened by the filter. Perhaps the most easily visualized approach, however, is to think of the bilinear filter as being exactly one texel in size, centered around the texture coordinate, like so:  The filter area then touches up to four texels (but just one texel if it s exactly centered over a texel). Each texel in the filter area is read and combined with the others according to the proportion of the filter that s over that texel. You can use this knowledge to do linear filtering along some axes but point-sample the other. For example, with 3-D textures you can set the r coordinate to k + 0.5 to effectively point-sample plane k of the 3-D texture, while still doing arbitrary bilinear filtering in the (s,t) plane. This is a fast way to change textures; rather than requiring a state change, it can be done by simply using a different r coordinate for three vertices, so it s handy for animations done by flipping through textures or for using multiple textures in a single vertex buffer s worth of point sprites. All other filters are variations of bilinear and point-sampled. Trilinear filtering for 2-D textures is like bilinear, but in two different mipmap levels at once, with the results from the two levels combined in a weighted average. Trilinear is orthogonal to the choice of point-sampled versus bilinear, so you can average between either type of filter in two miplevels, or select the nearest miplevel. Anisotropic filtering is basically one to eight of the above filters (one when magnifying, two or more when minifying) laid out in a line and weighted together, resulting in an asymmetric filter area that helps compensate for edge-on viewing. As usual, the filters can be point-sampled or bilinear, and nearest-mipmap or weighted-average-of-two-nearest-mipmaps (anisotropic filtering is not supported for 1-D or 3-D textures.) s the full set of 2-D filters, but other dimensions are available. 3-D textures can be point-sampled or 2 x 2 x 2 filtered, and independently nearest-mipmap or weighted-average-of-two-nearest-mipmaps. Similarly, 1-D textures can be  point-sampled or linear-filtered, and nearest-mipmap or weighted-average-of-two-nearest-mipmaps. The fact that all filters except point-sampled are built on bilinear filtering, or its 1-D or 3-D equivalents, is important because once we establish how point-sampled and bilinear are handled by the various texture address modes, the other filters will be straightforward extensions of bilinear. In particular, a trilinear filter is clamped, wrapped, mirrored, and so forth by applying the active texture address mode separately to each of the two bilinear samples that make up the trilinear filter; likewise, each of the two to eight subfilters (point-sampled or bilinear, nearest-mipmap or weighted-average-of-two-nearest-mipmaps) that make up an anisotropic filter are clamped, wrapped, etc., separately. Thus, the behavior of point-sampled and bilinear filters is all we need to know in order to understand how texture address modes work. (Actually, all that s required is an understanding of how point-sampled and linear features work in 1-D, but since most of your textures will be 2-D, we ll talk primarily about the latter. All the wrap modes below can be applied to any or all texture dimensions, regardless of whether the texture is 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D.) A pivotal aspect of non-point-sampled filtering is that for all filters except point-sampled, the texel containing the (u,v) filter point is not necessarily the only texel read, which can cause complications even with on-texture filter points. A bilinear filter sampled at (0,0) is going to want to read the texel at the upper left corner of the texture, which is fine, but also the texels to the left, above, and above and to the left of that texel none of which actually exist, as illustrated below. Obviously, this is a problem, but texture address modes exist precisely to handle this eventuality. Now that we understand (s,t), (u,v), [i][j], and filtering, we can discuss the first three texture address modes. D3DTADDRESS_WRAP The D3DTADDRESS_WRAP texture addressing mode tiles the texture at integer (s,t) coordinates, so the (s,t) texture coordinates (0,0) to (1,1) select the same texels as (1,0) to (2,1); likewise for ( 3) to (0, 2). Given an s texture coordinate from which to read a texel, the i texture coordinate from which the texel value is actually fetched is calculated as i = ifloor((s   floor(s)) * width) or equivalently i = ifloor(mod(u, width)) depending on whether you prefer to think in terms of s or u. (This paper will present both s and u formulations, since either can be a convenient frame of reference. They re conceptually equivalent, and it s convenient to be able to see how values in both coordinate systems map to the texture. Also, since all texture axes follow the same behavior, we will discuss only s and u here, but the same results obtain for t and v, or, for that matter, for r and p, for 3-D textures.) Above, mod() is defined to return the difference between u and the next lower multiple of width, so the result is always a positive number. Thus mod( 11.5,10) would be 8.5. Note that the above calculation is performed on a per-sample-point basis, not a per-filter-point basis that is, separately for every texel read by the filter (one texel for a point-sampled filter, up to four texels for a bilinear filter). Thus, for a bilinear filter with a filter point of (0,t), some texels will be read from the left edge of the texture, and others will wrap around to be read from the right edge. In other words, each of the up-to-four separate texel reads made for a bilinear filter is individually wrapped according to the above equation, so if the filter pokes off one edge of the texture, it will wrap seamlessly back around to the other edge. Another way to think of this texture mode is to imagine the texture expanded to an infinite plane tiled seamlessly with the texture, so that there is a specific texel at every [i][j] coordinate all the way out to infinity, as follows: The tiles are aligned so that the upper-left corner of one copy of the texture is at (0,0). Then any texture coordinates, no matter how large, simply map each vertex to somewhere on this infinite plane. (Be aware, however, that numeric precision issues limit the accuracy of very large texture coordinates; refer to the separate paper  Texcoord Range Issues  for details.) As an example, the texels that would be read for the bilinear filter point (2.1,1.85) (or, equivalently, the (u,v) texture coordinate (10.5,9.25)) are indicated. D3DTADDRESS_WRAP does not work with image textures. D3DTADDRESS_MIRROR The D3DTADDRESS_MIRROR texture addressing mode both tiles the texture and reverses each texture coordinate axis at integer s or t coordinates, so mirror images alternate. The (s,t) texture coordinates (0,0) to (1,1) select the same texels as (2,0) to (3,1), but (1,0) to (2,1) would select an image mirrored in s, and ( 1) to (0,0) would select an image mirrored in both s and t. Given an s texture coordinate from which to read a texel, the i texture coordinate used for the sample point is calculated as i = ifloor( (s   floor(s)) * width) if floor(s) is even i = ifloor( (1   floor(s))) * width) if floor(s) is odd or equivalently i = ifloor(fmod(u, width)) if floor(u / width) is even i = ifloor(width   fmod(u, width)) if floor(u / width) is odd and likewise for t, v, and j. Note that this calculation is performed separately for every texel read by the filter. Another way to think of this texture address mode is to imagine the texture expanded to an infinite plane (as described under D3DTADDRESS_WRAP) tiled seamlessly with 2 x 2 blocks, each containing four copies of the texture, one normal, one s-mirrored, one t-mirrored, and one mirrored in both s and t, as follows: The tiles are aligned so that the upper-left corner of one copy of the texture is at (0,0). Then the texture coordinates, no matter how large, simply map each vertex to someplace on this infinite plane. (Be aware, however, that numeric precision issues limit the accuracy of very large texture coordinates; refer to the separate paper  Texcoord Range Issues  for details.) As an example, the texels that would be read for the bilinear filter point (2.1,1.85) (or, equivalently, the (u,v) texture coordinate (10.5,9.25)) are indicated. D3DTADDRESS_MIRROR does not work with image textures. D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP The two modes we ve discussed so far operate on individual sample points that is, separately on each of the texels read by a filter. D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP takes a different approach to handling filters that run off the texture, clamping not individual sample points but rather the (u,v) filter point (the center of the filter) so that the filter never reads off the edge of the texture. When clamp mode is in effect, any attempt to place the filter point outside the texture or within one-half texel of the edge of the texture results in the filter point being moved to one-half texel from the edge of the texture; since a bilinear filter is one texel across, this keeps bilinear filters entirely on the texture at all times. Formally, the clamped filter point (which I ll call (u ) here) is calculated as  = s * width if 1 / (2 * width) <= s <= 1   1 / (2 * width)  = 1 / (2 * width) if s < 1 / (2 * width)  = 1   1 / (2 * width) if s > 1   1 / (2 * width) or equivalently if 0.5 <= u <= width   = 0.5 if u < 0.5  = width  if u > width  and similarly for t, v, and v . Again, this calculation is performed only once per texture per fragment, for the filter point. Another way to think of this texture mode is to imagine the texture expanded to an infinite plane (as described above under D3DTADDRESS_WRAP), with the border texels replicated to infinity so that any point can be sampled directly, as follows: As an example, the texels that would be read for the bilinear filter point (0.95,0.55) (or, equivalently, the (u,v) texture coordinate (4.75,2.75)) are indicated. Note that unlike wrap and mirror, there are no numeric precision issues associated with clamping (or with border or clamp-to-edge, for that matter). For anisotropic filters used with this texture address mode, each of the bilinear filter points in the anisotropic filter is clamped separately, so sample points can never extend off the texture. In particular, they can never extend into the border (which is discussed below). If you are familiar with OpenGL clamping, you may find it confusing that this mode is equivalent to OpenGL s CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode, while D3DTADDRESS_CLAMPTOEDGE is equivalent to OpenGL s CLAMP mode. The texture border At this point, we a going to have to digress to discuss border textures, an understanding of which is required for the remaining two texture address modes. As you may have noticed, the texture addressing modes we ve discussed so far share one common trait they never actually try to read texels off the edge of the texture. Instead, they simply map off-edge sample points back onto the texture (for wrap or mirror), or clamp the filter point so that all the sample points are on the texture (for clamp). That s fine for the cases that are satisfied by wrap, mirror, or clamp, but there are other scenarios that aren t addressed by those modes. For example, suppose that you want to draw a quad, covering it exactly once with the full extent of a bilinear-filtered texture. Neither wrap nor mirror would generally suit your needs, since as the filter point got within half a texel of the edge of the texture, it would start wrapping around to take samples from the opposite edge of the texture, which would usually produce undesired effects. It may not be immediately obvious why clamp wouldn t do the trick, but consider the following: The desired uv filter point, (0,0), should evenly filter two dark and two white texels producing a light gray in order to produce results consistent with (u,v) coordinate (1,1) or any other corner of four texels. However, because the filter is clamped to one-half texel from the edge of the texture, the filter point will be at (0.5,0.5) and will return the color of a dark texel. Thus the consistency of the checkerboard pattern will be broken toward the edges of the texture. What is needed here is a way of providing the proper checkerboard texels for the portions of filters that extend off the edge of the texture. (Note that wrap or mirror would in fact work in the particular case of the checkerboard above, but not in the far more common case where the left and right or top and bottom edges don t match up perfectly.) As another example, suppose that you want to draw two triangles, each with a different texture, next to each other as seamlessly as if you had combined them into a single texture that is, as if the bilinear filter could span the seam between them. Wrap and mirror obviously wouldn t work, because whenever it straddled the common edge, the filter would wrap to the other edge of the same texture. Clamp wouldn t work unless both textures had identical texels along the seam in which case the double row of identical texels surrounding the seam would be a visible artifact. What we need to solve this is a way to get proper data from both textures for a filter along a seam of this sort. There s no way a filter can read from two textures at once, but the Xbox Graphics Processing Unit (Xbox GPU) does offer a solution in the form of border textures. Before we can describe those, however, we have to introduce the concept of the border. Do you recall how, when discussing D3DTADDRESS_WRAP, we visualized the texture as expanding to an infinite plane? Let s do that once again, but this time, rather than replicating parts of the texture out to infinity, let s surround it with a border color out to infinity, where the border color is set by calling: IDirect3DDevice8::SetTextureStageState(stage, D3DTADDRESS_BORDER, color) Here the border color is green, and the texture is white and gray. Now when a filter extends over the edge of the texture, it ll have something to sample the border color. (Note that none of the three modes we ve seen thus far can actually sample the border, but, as you might expect, the modes we ll discuss shortly can.) The border color has its uses, as well see later, but since it provides only a single color for all off-texture sample points, it can t solve the above-mentioned problems. Fortunately, there s a more powerful way to define the contents border area: a border texture. Border textures A border texture is a texture that has a four-texel-wide fringe (the contents of which we ll call border texels) around the texture proper (which henceforth we ll call the normal texture or just the texture, and the contents thereof normal texels or just texels). Outside this fringe the border color comes into play, as described above. We ll call the entire area outside the texture the border, comprised of both border texels (if present that is, if the texture is a border texture) and the area beyond them that s covered by the border color. A figure is the best way to visualize this: Here the texture itself contains a gray-and-white checkerboard pattern, the border texels are vertical stripes of two shades of blue, and the border color is solid green. Only one texel of the border-color area is shown, but it extends to floating-point infinity. Note that parts of the border are addressed with negative texture coordinates, and that the origin the (0,0) point has moved over and down four texels from the upper left corner. Because both the origin and the texture itself have shifted by the same amount, texture coordinates that are within a border texture will read exactly the same texels as if the texture were not a border texture. Also note that the s and t coordinates of the outside of the border-texel area will vary with texture size, but the u and v coordinates will always be  4 and dimension + 4, where dimension is width or height. A texture is flagged as a border texture if the D3DFORMAT_BORDERSOURCE_COLOR bit in the texture's Format field is zero when SetTexture is called; this tells the hardware that the border source is not a color, but the border area of a texture. Using the Register APIs, this is done by simply not setting that bit in the Format field of the pre-constructed texture structure. Using CreateTexture, you can explicitly clear the bit after creating the texture with code along the following lines: IDirect3DTexture8 * pTexture; pDev->CreateTexture(..., &pTexture); pTexture->Format &= ~D3DFORMAT_BORDERSOURCE_COLOR; All that clearing this bit does is tell the hardware that there s a 4-texel fringe of border texels, that it should treat the upper-left corner as [i][j] coordinate ( 4), and that the texture pitch is the texture width plus the border plus padding that brings the total width up to the next power of two size (see below for details). Of course, each dimension is expanded separately. (For image textures, the pitch and the width are always independently set, regardless of whether the texture is a border texture or not it is up to the application to set the image texture pitch correctly, that is, to at least the image width plus space for the border texels. The hardware believes the value that is set for image pitch and will work regardless of the value set for it, even for values that are less than the image width; some weird effects are possible when you do that.) With border textures, the border can provide any desired texels for filters that extend off the edge of the normal texture. By copying texels from adjacent textures into the border, the seam problem described above can be solved. Similarly, border texels can provide additional filter data so that bilinear filtering can work properly right up to the edge of a stand-alone texture. Another important use of border textures is for cube maps, especially small ones, in order to allow the texture filtering to cross the cube map seams properly. Obviously, border textures add value only when filters can extend off the normal texture, which can never happen with any of the three texture addressing modes we ve discussed above. All three modes will work with border textures, but they map all texel coordinates into the st range (0,1) and never try to read outside the normal texture, so they work exactly the same way with or without border textures. Since border textures are considerably larger than normal textures, for reasons that will be explained shortly, it never makes sense to use border textures in wrap, mirror, or clamp mode, unless for some reason you need to switch dynamically between one of those modes and one of the two modes discussed below. However, the two remaining texture addressing modes border and clamp-to-edge can have filters that extend off the normal texture. It is with these modes that border textures come into their own, as we ll see shortly. Border textures are obviously larger than equivalent normal textures, if only because of the four-texel padding around the texture. A more serious impact, however, arises because all non-image textures that is, swizzled and DXTC textures, which generally constitute the bulk of all textures used must have power-of-2 dimensions. For all non-image textures, the border texels cause the texture size to have to double (or more, for texture dimensions smaller than 8) in each direction, so for swizzled and DXTC textures border textures are at least four times larger than their normal equivalents. This brings us to an interesting quirk of mipmapped border textures. Large border texture mipmaps simply quadruple in size versus equivalent non-border textures, so a 16 x 16 mipmap for a border texture requires 32 x 32 texels of total memory space. Only 24 x 24 of this is actually used the 16 x 16 texels plus a 4-wide border but mipmaps must be powers of 2 in size. The next miplevel, 8 x 8, likewise doubles in each dimension, to 16 x 16, but now no space is wasted. Here comes the strange part: the following miplevel, 4 x 4, ends up taking the same 16 x 16 block of memory that the preceding miplevel did, because the 4-wide border together with the 4x4 texture makes a 12 x 12 block, and 16 x 16 is the next power-of-2 size. For the same reason, all border texture miplevels from 8 x 8 on down require 16 x 16 blocks of memory. This size expansion applies to each dimension separately, so if the miplevel is a 3-D texture of size 2 x 4 x 16, the actual allocated size is 16 x 16 x 32. Normally, the largest texture dimension allowed is 4K texels in 1-D or 2-D, and 512 texels in 3-D. However, because they have negative texture coordinates, border textures have one bit less with which to address textures, so the largest border texture dimension allowed in 1-D or 2-D is 2K texels, and in 3-D, 256 texels. D3DTADDRESS_BORDER The D3DTADDRESS_BORDER texture address mode applies the border in a straightforward way, sampling the border for any sample points off the texture. When a border texture is not in use, the sample value for a given sample point (one of up to four read by a bilinear filter) is calculated as sample_value = border_color if s >= 1 or s < 0 or t >= 1 or t < 0 sample_value = texture(ifloor(s * width),ifloor(t * height)) if 0 <= s < 1 and 0 <= t < 1 or equivalently sample_value = border_color   if u >= width or u < 0 or v >= height or v < 0 sample_value = texture(ifloor(u),ifloor(v))     if 0 <= u < width and 0 <= v < height Thus, all coordinates within the texture return the corresponding texel, and all coordinates outside the texture return the border color. Things actually work the same way with border textures, thanks to the magic of negative coordinates, except that the limits at which the border color kicks in change. When a border texture is in use, the sample value for a given sample point is calculated as sample_value = border_color if s >= 1 + 4 / width or s <  4 / width or    t >= 1 + 4 / height or t <  4 / height sample_value = texture(ifloor(s * width),ifloor(t * height)) 4 / width <= s < 1 + 4 / width and 4 / height <= t < 1 + 4 / height or equivalently sample_value = border color if u >= width + 4 or u <     v >= height + 4 or v < -4 sample_value = texture(ifloor(u),ifloor(v)) 4 <= u < width + 4 and 4 <= v < height + 4 where texture [i][j] handles negative coordinates in order to address border texels, and the upper-left corner of the texture is at (u,v) coordinate ( 4). Thus, all coordinates within the texture or the border texels return the corresponding texel, and all coordinates outside that return the border color. Again, the above equations are applied to each sample point within a filter, rather than to the filter point itself. s easy to see how the infinite-texture visualization approach discussed earlier applies in this mode; simply plunk the filter down wherever you want on the border-surrounded infinite texture discussed above, and sample the values under the filter. As an example, the following figure illustrates how proper checkerboarded filtering can be provided right to the edge of the normal (non-border) texture by using border textures and border texture address mode. Here the filter point is (0,0), the upper-left corner of the normal texture, and the solid black line encloses the four texels three of them border texels that this filter reads. Two of the sampled texels are white and two are black, and they re all weighted equally, so the resulting filter value will be the correct value for this position in a checkerboard, gray. Note that only a one-texel-wide strip of the border has been checkerboarded; a bilinear filter with filter point that s on the normal texture can t reach more than one texel into the border, so there s no point to providing any more border texels in this case. However, a full border should be provided in cases where the filter point isn t guaranteed to remain on the normal texture. Also, an anisotropic filter can have a wider spread, so a full set of border texels should be provided if you re using anisotropic filtering. Compressed textures, which are composed of 4x4 blocks, are easy to add borders to; just add a layer of 4x4 blocks around the edge of the texture. For the case of filtering two DXTC textures together seamlessly, you can generally just pull the adjacent compressed blocks from the adjoining textures and use those directly. (However, for the 2x2 and smaller mip levels you will need to recompress the resulting block this will be discussed in another paper on mipmapping.) The case of the seam between adjacent textures is similarly addressed by border texture mode combined with border textures. Simply put the edge texels of each texture into the appropriate border texels of the other, and the filter will have the correct texels to sample when it straddles the seam between the triangles the textures are drawn on. Do not confuse the texture addressing mode we ve been discussing border texture addressing mode with border textures themselves, despite the unfortunate similarity of names. Border texture address mode tells the hardware where to look for off-texture samples, specifying that the border (which may or may not include border texels) provides sample values for sample points off the edge of the texture. In contrast, a border texture tells the hardware how to address the texture, specifying that there is a four-texel-wide fringe around a texture, with the upper-left corner at ( 4) and (for non-image textures) a texture pitch that is twice the width. Either one can be enabled or disabled, and will work properly, independently of the other. As an example of the usefulness of border addressing mode without a border texture, consider pasting a high detail texture in the middle of a low detail texture by using a border color of (0,0,0,0) on the high-detail texture and D3DTOP_BLENDTEXTUREALPHA. As another example, a reasonably effective (and much less memory-hungry) alternative to using border textures is to concatenate textures together by abutting them and adding them together, using border colors of black and border mode, so that the textures smoothly blend from one to the other. Both approaches save texture memory, but at the cost of using additional texture stages. D3DTADDRESS_CLAMPTOEDGE The D3DTADDRESS_CLAMPTOEDGE texture addressing mode is an Xbox extension. It is exactly like D3DTADDRESS_BORDER, except for one thing: the filter point is clamped to the texture. Rather than describe it in detail, we re simply going to say that it s a subclass of D3DTADDRESS_BORDER that imposes an extra restriction on the filter point. Formally, the filter point (which I ll call (u ) here) is calculated as  = s*width if 0 <= s <= 1 if s < 0  = width if s > 1 (see below for point-sampled behavior) or equivalently if 0 <= u <= width if u < 0  = width if u > width (see below for point-sampled behavior) and similarly for t, v, and v . Again, this calculation is performed only once per texture per fragment, for the filter point. One quirk of this mode is that point-sampled filters get clamped to [0,1) rather than [0,1]. This means that a point-sampled filter point with an s coordinate of, say, 1.1 ends up sampling the texel at the i coordinate width 1. The net result is that when clamp-to-edge is in effect, it is not possible to point-sample off the normal texture. This applies only to point-sampled filter points; bilinear filter points clamp to [0,1]. For bilinear filtering and clamp-to-edge texture addressing mode, with 1-D textures, up to 50 percent of samples for a single filter can be from the border; with 2-D textures, up to 75 percent of samples can be from the border; and with 3-D textures and clamp mode, up to 87.5 percent of samples can be from the border. For anisotropic filters used with this texture address mode, each of the bilinear filter points in the anisotropic filter is clamped separately, so no filter can extend more than one-half texel into the border. If you are familiar with OpenGL clamping, you may find it confusing that this mode is equivalent to OpenGL s CLAMP mode, while D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP is equivalent to OpenGL s CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode. Finally, if you want to use the infinite-texture visualization with clamp-to-edge, you must do it by first clamping the filter point to be on the normal texture, and then treating it as border addressing mode. In other words, you can t really use an infinite texture, but must rather use a subpart of the infinite texture of border addressing mode. The reason why this is so is not important (and you can probably figure it out quickly if you think about it); I just wanted to make sure you re aware of this limitation. Summary of texture address modes Filter point texture coordinate modification: Mirror Clamp clamped to one-half texel inside texture boundary Border Clamp-to-edge clamped to texture boundary Sample point texture coordinate modification: wrapped modulo texture width or height Mirror wrapped modulo texture width or height, inverted from one wrap to next Clamp Border none; any sample points off texture (and texture border, if present) return border color Clamp-to-edge none; any sample points off texture (and texture border, if present) return border color Can sample border: Mirror Clamp Border Clamp-to-edge Xbox texture addressing modes        Microsoft Confidential         DATE \@ "M/d/yyyy"  1/16/200112/28/2000 Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES  (u,v) filter point Texels read for filter calculations; these are combined with a weighted average to produce the filter value for the texture stage Texels read for filter calculations; these are combined with a weighted average to produce the filter value for the texture stage (u,v) filter point filter area -0.67 -0.67 filter area (0,0) (4,2) / (20,10) (-2,2) / (-10,10) (4,-2) / (20,-10) (s,t)    /  (u,v) (-2,-2) / (-10,-10) (0,0) (4,2) / (20,10) (-2,2) / (-10,10) (4,-2) / (20,-10) (s,t)    /  (u,v) (-2,-2) / (-10,-10) clamped filter area texture clamped (u,v) filter point correct (u,v) filter point weight u filter point texels read for bilinear filter point (s,t) = (2.1,1.85) (u,v) = (10.5,9.25) texels read for bilinear filter point (s,t) = (2.1,1.85) (u,v) = (10.5,9.25) u filter point weight Texel read by point-sampled filter and returned as filter value (u,v) filter point texels read for bilinear filter point (s,t) = (0.95,0.55) (u,v) = (4.75,2.75) (0,0) (4,2) / (20,10) (-2,2) / (-10,10) (4,-2) / (20,-10) (s,t)    /  (u,v) (-2,-2) / (-10,-10) texture correct filter area filter area (0,0) (4,2) / (20,10) (-2,2) / (-10,10) (4,-2) / (20,-10) (s,t)    /  (u,v) (-2,-2) / (-10,-10) (u,v) filter point Texels read for filter calculations border border texels normal texels

This makes it critical to compress large data structures as much as possible, and right at the head of the list of things to shrink is textures. Xbox offers several ways to compress textures, with varying compression levels and effects on visual quality relative to 8888 textures. The object of this paper is to familiarize you with the texture optimizations and tradeoffs available to you. One way to compress textures is by palettizing them. Palettized textures can compress at a ratio of 4:1 losslessly for up to 256 colors per texture, but beyond that visual quality will degrade from quantization to 256 colors. Performance degradation may also result if multiple palettized textures are used simultaneously, especially if more than one palette is active at any one time, because there are only sufficient resources to decompress a maximum of eight palettized texels per clock, and those resources must be allocated between all simultaneously active palettes and palettized textures. Another means of compression is using fewer color components. For example, a light map can be stored as an intensity texture, using only 8 bits per texel. Compression can also be achieved by using fewer bits per texel. For example, 4444 and 565 textures require only half the memory footprint and bandwidth of 8888 textures. Because bits are lopped off color components indiscriminately, this will often not be as effective as more discriminating compression schemes such as palettization and DirectX texture compression, but because, unlike the other schemes, each texel s color is completely independent of its neighbors, it can be useful at times. Finally, textures can be compressed with  DirectX texture compression, and it is this form of compression that this paper is primarily about. There are five distinct DirectX texture compression formats; details of these are discussed in the help for Microsoft  DirectX  8, but for our purposes, they can be summed up quite simply, as follows. All five DirectX texture compression formats compress texels in 4x4 blocks, and all five formats compress color in the same way (with one slight variation in the case of transparent DXT1). Two 16-bit anchor colors are specified for each block. Two additional colors are implied, one-third and two-thirds of the way (via linear interpolation) between the two anchor colors, for a total of four available colors per block. (The anchor colors are 16-bit, but the interpolated colors are calculated with 32-bit precision.) A 16-entry table contains two bits for each of the 16 texels in the block, thereby selecting one of the four colors per texel. Thus, in all DirectX texture compression formats, the net size in memory of the color alone accounting for both the table and the anchor colors and disregarding alpha is four bits per texel. Alpha varies from one format to another. DXT1 supports only transparency effectively, one-bit alpha not translucency. Transparency can be enabled or disabled independently for each 4x4 DXT1 block. It is disabled (that is, the block consists only of opaque pixels) if the first anchor color is larger than the second anchor color; otherwise, it is enabled. If you do use transparency for a DXT1 block, only three non-transparent colors are available for that block, the anchor colors and the color halfway between them; the fourth color index is used to select the transparent color, which is always (0,0,0,0) (you can think of this as being a transparent pixel in pre-multiplied alpha form). Only DXT1 is capable of using the fourth color for transparency; the other formats always support four colors, and specify alpha separately. DXT2 and DXT3 store four explicit bits of alpha per texel. (The documented difference between the two is that DXT2 assumes the color data has been premultiplied by alpha and DXT3 assumes it has not. However, in fact there is no difference between DXT2 and DXT3 on Xbox, and similarly, there is no difference between DXT4 and DXT5.) DXT4 and DXT5 store two 8-bit alpha anchor values and linearly interpolate six more alpha values between the anchors (much like color), and a table of 16 three-bit entries selects one of those eight alpha values for each texel. There is effectively no size cost to DXT1 alpha (although you do lose one of the four colors). For DXT2 through DXT5, alpha costs four bits per texel. Consequently, the total size per texel counting both color and alpha of DXT1 is four bits; for DXT2 through DXT5, the total size per texel is eight bits. At first mention, DirectX texture compression sounds horrible only 4 colors for every 16; you lose up to 75 percent of your colors! but in actual practice it works well for a great many textures. You wouldn t want to use DirectX texture compression to, say, store a normal map a palettized texture would probably be a much better choice there but DirectX texture compression often works very well, and given its huge bandwidth and footprint benefits, it can and should be your workhorse texture format, especially if your artists pay attention to creating artwork that compresses well. In particular, when alpha is not an issue, DXT1 offers unmatched footprint and bandwidth benefits. There is one additional detail to DirectX texture compression visual quality, though, and it s an important one. Although all DirectX texture compression formats store color compressed in the same format, they do not all decompress color into the same format. DXT2 through DXT5 decompress into 8888, thus achieving 4:1 compression. From a visual quality perspective, this is ideal. However, decompression takes place as texels are stored into the texture cache, so DXT2-5 formats take up a lot of space in the texture cache and since the texture cache is only 8 KB, space is at a premium. DXT1, in contrast, had been implemented in such a way that it decompresses into 1555. (You might think it would be 565 unless there s alpha, but because all blocks have to have the same format in the texture cache and because alpha can be selected on a block-by-block basis in DXT1, the decompressed-to texture format has to have alpha in it.) Like the other DirectX texture compression formats, this achieves 4:1 compression. (The compression is actually 8:1 relative to 8888, but since the decompressed result is in fact 1555, not 8888, that doesn t seem like an appropriate standard of comparison to me but think of it as 8:1 if you wish; the results are the same either way.) However, both the compressed and uncompressed formats are half the size of those for the other DirectX texture compression formats. In terms of memory footprint, texture footprint, and bandwidth, this is ideal. Unfortunately, 16-bit decompression of DXT1 is not ideal in terms of visual quality, sometimes resulting in visible banding and other artifacts. This is noticeable enough with currently shipping NVIDIA hardware that it was written up in the press. While it by no means makes DXT1 unusable, it does decrease the number of textures for which DXT1 is appropriate. Fortunately, this problem is partly fixed in the Xbox GPU. (Note that the fix is not in the Alpha-2 XDK.) The Xbox DXT1 fix works as follows. On the Xbox GPU, if the render target is 16-bpp, then DXT1 is, as you d expect, decompressed to 16-bit texels in the texture cache. With a 32-bpp render target, DXT1 textures are still decompressed to 16-bit format, but as textures are decompressed, an encoding/decoding technique is employed to add a subtle amount of noise and thereby minimize 16-bit artifacts. This isn t a perfect solution; because it happens in texture space, not screen space, aliasing can happen when textures are minified, and the noise can become visible when textures are magnified. Nonetheless, it helps considerably in many cases. Consider the following. First, here s a 24-bpp texture with subtle gradients:  EMBED Imaging.Document   Next, here s the same image compressed with DXT1 (using the S3TC tool) and decompressed to 16 bits/pixel:  EMBED Imaging.Document   Banding is readily apparent.  Finally, here s the same image compressed with DXT1 and then decompressed with the Xbox DXT1 noise fix:  EMBED Imaging.Document   Note that the banding is completely eliminated. Similarly, here s a 24-bit texture:  EMBED Imaging.Document   and here s the same texture after DXT1 compression and subsequent decompression with the Xbox fix:  EMBED Imaging.Document   As you can see, the DXT1 fix can help a great deal. Of course, some of the effects of the noise will be visible only when triangles tilt and move, but the results of tests thus far are promising, with few artifacts even for moving surfaces. If you d like to see the effect of the DXT1 fix on a few of your textures, you can send them as 24-bit .tga files to   HYPERLINK "mailto:xboxds@xbox.com"  xboxds@xbox.com , and we will DXT1-compress them, decompress to 16-bit textures using the noise fix, and send them back to you. The fix doesn t help in all cases; there are some instances in which the noise becomes visible. The noise artifacts are not very noticeable in most of these cases, but there are exceptions. For example, over large areas of nearly-constant color, the added noise may be more visible than you would like. Also, the noise artifacts can become quite noticeable when 3-D textures are sampled along a slice of constant u or v, because the noise is added based only on u and v, not p (the third scaled texture coordinate). For example, consider the following constant-v slice through a 24-bit 3-D texture:  EMBED Word.Picture.8   After DXT1 compression and decompression with the Xbox noise fix, the added noise produces visible artifacts: Fortunately, it is possible to disable the noise and get straight 16-bit decompression whenever that s preferable, as would likely be the case here. However, note that each time noise is enabled or disabled, the graphics pipeline flushes (not the whole push-buffer, just what s in the hardware pipeline), so this is not something you d want to do too frequently. This only happens with a 32-bit render target, of course. Overall, although the fix doesn t always help, it should help DXT1 be more broadly useful than it would be otherwise. Consider the following 24-bit test pattern: s the same test pattern after DXT1 compression and decompression with the fix: The part of the test pattern at the lower right is not reproduced correctly (DirectX texture compression has a hard time with very high-frequency texture components), but the rest of the image has been preserved remarkably well. Note that all of the above textures are available for download (Images.zip, on BetaPlace) if you want to experiment with them. Of course, no hardware with this fix exists yet, so we ll have to wait to see exactly how well it works across a broad range of textures but the bottom line is that DXT1 will be pretty broadly usable on Xbox, and should be the first option to try for non-alpha textures, with DXT2-5 and palettized textures as the next best choices, and uncompressed textures (possibly with a reduced number of color components or bits per color) as the ultimate fallback. It is true that while the DXT1 fix will help, it would have been ideal to have additionally given the programmer the option to decompress DXT1 to 32-bit texels if desired; this would have resulted in substantially better visual quality for some textures, making DXT1 even more widely usable. Any of the other DirectX texture compression formats can of course be used to get 32-bit texels, but because those formats are twice as big as DXT1, they impose a considerable memory footprint and bandwidth cost relative to DXT1 (although still very attractive compared to uncompressed textures). So it would certainly have been nice if the 32-bit DXT1 option had been available but it isn t, so we ll just have to work with what we have, which shouldn t be too bad with the addition of the 16-bit noise fix.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Xbox for PC Developers TitleXbox for PC Developers Colin James O'Neill Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0ays: It has a hard disk, an Intel CPU, an NVIDIA graphics chip, a Microsoft  Windows  2000 based operating system, Winsock, and a Microsoft  Visual C++ based development system. However, the Xbox game system is not a personal computer; it differs from a PC in important ways. Although PC knowledge and skills will be easy to apply on the Xbox game system, developing great software for the Xbox game system is by no means the same as developing great software for a computer, and straight ports are not acceptable. That doesn't mean that developing software for the Xbox game system will be more difficult; to the contrary, many of the complications of PC development are gone, such as scaling across different hardware. By the same token, however, the technical bar for Xbox games will be very high, and meeting that bar will require careful attention to the unique aspects of the Xbox game system. This paper will introduce the major differences to be aware of to make a successful transition from development for computer games to development for Xbox games.  These are the main things to keep in mind:  The Xbox game system is a console that exists only for gaming.  The hardware is fixed and will never, ever change.  The Xbox system software is based on Microsoft  Win32 , but many of the Win32 APIs and features aren't there because they aren't needed on a fixed-hardware game system that doesn't have virtual memory. Also, many of the libraries that are present in the Xbox system software differ from their PC counterparts.  Users have specific expectations: plug and play, instant access to games, no installation, no patches, no extensive controller configuration, and the possibility of an arcade-like experience.  Xbox is a console This may sound obvious, but the Xbox game system is a console, built specifically to play games. This drives all aspects of the design; features that games cannot use are not present. The personal computer serves as a general-purpose appliance, built to support multipurpose software of any sort; the Xbox console serves as a game appliance, built to support the best games possible. Anything that detracts from that goal is not part of the design for example, adding system software support for multitasking (as opposed to threading, which is fully supported) at the cost of memory and full control of performance by the game. Keep this in mind while reading the rest of this document, because it defines the basis for the differences between the Xbox game system and the PC.  Fixed hardware The biggest difference between the Xbox game system and the PC is that the Xbox game system is a fixed, closed hardware platform. Every Xbox console will have the same Intel CPU, with a 16-kilobyte (KB)/16-KB code/data (32 KB total) L1 cache, a 128-KB L2 cache, and a 133-megahertz (MHz), 64-bit front-side bus. Likewise, each Xbox console will have the same NVIDIA graphics chip (GPU), running at the same speed; the same 200-MHz, 128-bit double data rate random access memory (DDR RAM) yielding 6.4 gigabit (Gbit)/sec memory bandwidth; the same 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM; the same hard disk and DVD drive; and the same input controller. Thus, software compatible with the Xbox game system will run exactly the same way on every Xbox console. This will be a new experience for developers accustomed to writing software that must span several generations of and many models of computer graphics chips, each with its own feature set and quirks (not to mention driver revisions) but it should be a good experience. If nothing else, the benefits of having to test a game on only one driver/hardware combination are tremendous. Just as gratifying is the ability to carefully tune a game's software, models, and artwork to maximize use of the hardware. These advantages alone should enable a good Xbox game to outperform a game running on an equivalently powerful computer. To put it another way, when you write a game on a PC, you don't push it to the limit because you have to span a wide range of hardware. On the Xbox game system, you do.  As another example, a game title can rely on the DVD's seeking and streaming speed to be the same in every Xbox console, so the game developer can assume a consistent level of performance when designing the game's model, texture, and audio management. Yet another example is that the input controller is fixed, so every feature of the buttons and controls can be used without complications.  Many things available on PCs are not available on Xbox The Xbox game system gives developers considerably more ability to leverage the hardware, but the flip side is that it demands more from them as well. As a prime example, the Xbox game system doesn't support virtual memory, so developers must carefully manage their memory footprint to stay within the 64-MB limit at all times. Memory management is no longer a matter of blindly allocating memory as needed and trying to stay  reasonably  small; every allocation must be accounted for and charged against the 64-MB limit. Basically, the resources in the Xbox game system are set for all time, with no   whatsoever. The developer has complete control and complete responsibility, and is given freedom to take the Xbox game system as far as it can go at the cost of a number of features that simplify development but interfere with getting the most from the hardware.  Again, the bottom line is that the Xbox game system is a console a console with some nice features from computers, but a game system nonetheless.  In addition to lacking virtual memory, the Xbox game system lacks some other features you would expect from a computer. Of course, the game system has no keyboard and no mouse. There's a screen, but normally it's a TV, although it can be high-definition television (HDTV) or a VGA-compatible monitor. In TV mode, the Xbox game system outputs 640   480 interlaced, and, due to the NTSC signal, can reliably support only 40-column text. The Xbox Dashboard that comes up when no DVD is inserted is nothing like Microsoft  Windows Explorer, and of course there's no windowing.  Also missing are many familiar Win32 APIs. The Xbox game system has no Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which means no system software support for fonts or bitmaps, and most of Win32 USER is missing as well. Unnecessary API sets such as printing and remote procedure call (RPC) are gone. The Xbox game system supports Unicode but not ANSI nor double-byte character set (DBCS). Microsoft  Direct3D , Microsoft  DirectSound , Microsoft  DirectMusic , and Microsoft  DirectPlay  are supported. However, there will be no support for Microsoft  DirectDraw  (integrated into Direct3D), Microsoft  DirectShow  (to be replaced by a new library), Microsoft  DirectInput , Microsoft  DirectSetup, and Application Manager (not applicable for the Xbox game system).  All supported Win32 APIs are listed in  Base Services Functions  in the Xbox Development Kit. Note that many APIs will change to meet the unique requirements of the Xbox game system, in particular because it lacks a general allocator backed by virtual memory for use by system software.  The Xbox game system has a hard disk, but it is organized quite a bit differently than under the Windows platform. The hard disk is sandboxed into several areas for saved games, game-controlled caching (contents saved between games), scratch space (contents not saved between games), system use, and online downloads. Games that need the higher performance of the hard disk (for faster random-access streaming of audio, for example) need to be able to copy the appropriate data over to the hard disk without making the user wait, so background copying while the game starts to run is mandatory. Also, the system can reclaim cached files whenever another game needs cache space, so a game has to be able to deal with deletion of cached files. There are limitations on how much space a game can rely on having available for scratch space and cached files, on what files and parts of the disk a program can access, and on how big saved games can be.  All controllers are universal serial bus (USB) devices, and games must be able to handle, on the fly, the case in which a user plugs in a controller during gameplay. Memory cards plug into the controllers and will be visible to the game system as a storage destination. Telephone and broadband modems are options, the former as USB devices and the latter as Ethernet devices. Games should be able to save to the hard disk or the memory cards. For this reason, saved games should be no larger than 8 MB. Many things are different because Xbox is different Even things that are familiar from the computer are often a bit different on the Xbox game system, both because the Xbox game system is a fixed platform and because it is a console. For instance, because the Xbox game system lacks virtual memory, the libraries have to be able to operate out of a fixed memory pool controlled by the game. Also, the system software runs at Ring 0 to support the best possible performance and to give games full access to the hardware of the Xbox game system. Lastly, all of the system software except the kernel is in the form of libraries stored on the game's DVD, so each game effectively ships with its own customized and tested version of the system software. Again, the game developer is responsible for resource management; only the bits of the system software that a game actually needs should be linked in.  DirectX for the Xbox game system differs substantially from the the PC version. For one thing, every feature of the GPU is exposed, such as the register combiners' support for dual multiplies, dot-products, conditional tests, three outputs per stage, and extra writable registers relative to the PC version of DirectX 8.0. For another, legacy support for older versions of DirectX has been removed. Also, the libraries have been changed to reflect the lack of virtual memory; the game has much more control over the memory footprint of DirectX than on a PC. Many cases can't fail on the Xbox game system, resulting in less need to check for error returns.  One significant difference in DirectX is the result of the Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) of the Xbox game system, in which the CPU, GPU, and audio processor all share a single memory space. In particular, the UMA eliminates the copying of vertices and textures from system memory to video memory, a process that can substantially slow down computers. An Xbox game can stream a texture from the DVD into memory and have the GPU use it immediately. One implication is that textures should be stored in the swizzled format that is most efficient for the GPU because there's no longer a copy step to perform the swizzle as part of unlocking the texture.  Bottom line: Xbox is a console The long and the short of it are that the Xbox game system is a console and PC games aren't going to port right over. However, the Xbox game system takes many good features from computers and adapts them for a fixed platform, so it'll be easy to apply PC knowledge and skills to programming for the Xbox game system. It'll be exciting to see how far developers can push the potent combination of computer technology and the fixed hardware of the Xbox game system.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox Interactive Demos Technical Guidelines Title _AdHocReviewCycleID _EmailSubject _AuthorEmail _AuthorEmailDisplayName _PreviousAdHocReviewCycleIDXbox Interactive Demos Technical Guidelines Scott Berfield Normal.dot Scott Berfield Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags stockticker Month Z&HKZF(IDATH 2!M!c%bjbjk Xbox Interactive Demos Technical Guidelines Revised 10/9/2001 The Technical Guidelines define technical specifications that the Interactive Demos should follow. The benefit of conforming to these guidelines is that by creating such an interactive demo, you will be able to deliver it to both the Official Xbox Magazine and Microsoft with confidence that it will work with both of their launchers. Transitions One of the challenges we have with demos is represented in the following diagram: We have a launcher application hypothetically called LAUNCHER.XBE, and we have an interactive demo hypothetically called DEMO.XBE.  LAUNCHER.XBE knows the name of DEMO.XBE because at launch, it parsed a file that contains this information. With that in mind, transitioning from LAUNCHER.XBE to DEMO.XBE is a straightforward call to XLaunchNewImage() with the full path of DEMO.XBE.  However, upon return, DEMO.XBE doesn t know what XBE to call because it doesn t know what XBE called it, unless we take advantage of a LAUNCH_DATA structure and the XLaunchNewImage and XGetLaunchInfo library calls. The following sections define a LAUNCH_DATA structure called DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA and explain how to use it. The DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA structure: struct DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA DWORD dwID; DWORD dwRunmode; DWORD dwTimeout;  szLauncherXBE[64]; char  szLaunchedXBE[64];  szDemoInfo[MAX_LAUNCH_DATA_SIZE  (128 * sizeof(char))  (4 * sizeof(DWORD))]; This is a value generated internally by the menu system so that it can keep track of its position in its hierarchy. The demo segment should store this value and pass it back when it returns to the menu. dwRunmode RUNMODE_KIOSKMODE 0x01 Attract. In attract mode (kiosk mode) the demo should run as described in TCR 0.9-3-37 and allow the user to start the game by pressing any button. RUNMODE_USERSELECTED 0x02  Playable. The demo segment should start normally, going to a menu/playable section instead of going into attract mode. dwTimeout This is the value in milliseconds that the demo segment should run for, 0 meaning no timeout. If the demo segment is in playable mode the timer should be reset each time user input is recognized. This will prevent the demo from exiting while a user is playing. If sufficient time passes with no user input that the timer expires, the demo should immediately exit. This behavior is required. The one exception is if you have a non-interactive sequence that runs longer than the timeout value allows for. In this case it is acceptable to complete the sequence prior to starting the timer.  szLauncherXBE This is the name of the calling XBE. Upon return, the demo segment will call this XBE. OXM: D:\DEFAULT.XBE Microsoft: D:\XDEMOS.XBE szLaunchedXBE This is the name of the called XBE. If your interactive demo needs to know what folder it s running in, you get the path from this field. szDemoInfo Additional information. It s unused, but it s there because the size of LAUNCH_DATA is fixed, so if additional information has to be passed, we use this member. Launch Conditions Requirement: At launch the demo XBE should call XGetLaunchInfo() to check for data passed to it by the menu system. The demo segment should then run in the mode described in that data. DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA demoLaunchData; XGetLaunchData(&demoLaunchData); At this point, demoLaunchData contains all the launch data. It is important that the demo check for the mode in which it is running. If the value of pdwLaunchDataType is LDT_FROM_DASHBOARD, the demo is running as a stand-alone application and the LAUNCH_DATA structure will not contain useful information. In this case, the demo should not include an option to exit to the launcher and should not make any assumptions about the data passed to it. A value of LDT_TITLE, on the other hand, means your demo was launched from one of the launcher programs and should operate properly with regard to the DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA structure defined above. Exit Conditions Requirement: When the demo segment has completed, it should XLaunchNewImage() with the name of the launcher XBE contained in the launch data. In addition, the dwID field of the demoLaunchData parameter should contain exactly the same thing as was passed to the demo. The easiest way to achieve this is to preserve the DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA structure and pass it back to the launcher unchanged. XLaunchNewImage(demoLaunchData.szLauncherXBE, demoLaunchData); Folder Structure and Paths It is important to note that the use of XLaunchNewImage does NOT remap the D:\ drive. Thus it is critical that your demo make no assumptions about where it exists in the directory structure. In the following example, replace InteractiveDemo with the name of the folder for your interactive demo, and InteractiveDemo.xbe with the name of your XBE. On the demo disc, the structure will be similar to the following: default.xbe   // This is the launcher executable <All launcher data files> // and all required launcher data. \<All launcher data folders> \InteractiveDemo // The folder holding your demo. InteractiveDemo.xbe <All interactive demo data files> \<All interactive demo data folders> Because the transition from default.xbe (the launcher) to InteractiveDemo.xbe (your demo) is done using XLaunchNewImage, the D:\ drive is not remapped. So when InteractiveDemo.xbe is running, if it looks for data files on any of its directories, it needs to look them up with the following path: D:\InteractiveDemo\<folder name>\<data file name>, instead of D:\<folder name>\<data file name>. This means that the demo cannot make any assumptions about where it s running on the disc. To get that information, it should look at the szLaunchedXBE field of the DEMO_LAUNCH_DATA structure, which in the example would contain D:\InteractiveDemo\InteractiveDemo.xbe. If you strip off the name of the XBE file, you will be left with the path to the interactive demo. You need to prepend that path to whatever files need to be loaded.  TitleIDs for Demos One side effect of the need to pass data between the launcher and an interactive demo is that the demo and the launcher must share the same TitleID. To make this easier to test, you must use a TitleID of 0 (zero) for all interactive demos. Multiple Threads and XLaunchNewImage You Interactive Demo will call XLaunchNewImage when the user exits back to the launcher. The following information is very important; it can cause your demo to fail certification if it s not taken into account.  XLaunchNewImage is a fairly destructive API. It results in a reset of much of the kernel and a warm boot of the Xbox. Because of this, some care must be used when calling this function. In general, you should try to have as little as possible going on when the Xbox is rebooted. Some specific areas known to cause problems: Submixing while calling XLaunchNewImage Audio/video on another thread from the one calling XLaunchNewImage I/O to the DVD, hard disk, or MU while calling XLaunchNewImage (including yet-to-be-completed Async I/O calls) Again, you must be careful when calling XLaunchNewImage. Make sure you check all the threads of your game code to ensure that they are all stopped prior to calling XLaunchNewImage.  Hard Disk Usage Requirement: Game demos may not access any storage location, either on the hard disk or on a connected memory unit, other than the utility region. It is permitted for a demo to use the hard disk for caching data through the utility region, but you must not build your image with a request to mount that region automatically. Instead, you should explicitly mount the region using XMountUtilityDrive with the bFormatClean flag. Failure to do this will result in a  certification failure. Save Games Requirement: The demo segment should not allow loading or saving of games. Media Performance The demo segments may be placed in any location on the final disc, so there will be no way for the developer to know what performance they will get from the drive. Thus, the demo segment should not rely on getting a specific data rate when streaming from the game disc. Appendix 1   Demo-Specific TCRs The demos are bound to the same TCRs as the games, so you should make sure your demo complies before submitting it. However, the following is specific to Interactive Demos: Game Demo and Promotional Discs This section documents additional requirements for game demo and promotional discs, including magazine companion discs and retail promotional giveaways. Except as noted in this section, game demos must also meet all the requirements in the preceding sections. The requirements in this section are required for any game demo. Additional requirements may be imposed by the publishers of the demo compilation for the purpose of launch shell integration. 1.2-7-1  Hard Disk Usage Requirement: Game demos may not access any storage location, either on the hard disk or on a connected memory unit, other than the utility region. 1.2-7-2  Utility Region Access Requirement: Game demos must explicitly call the XMountUtilityDrive function to use the utility region, and must specify the bFormatClean flag. Supplemental documentation: for more information about the XMountUtilityDrive function, see the XDK documentation. 1.2-7-3  No Networking Functionalities Requirements: Game demos must not implement any networking functionalities. 1.2-7-4  No MU Access Requirement: Game demos must not access any memory units for reading or writing data. 1.2-7-5  No Nickname Access Requirement: Game demos must not use the nickname feature. 1.2-7-6  No Player-Created Game Soundtrack Access Requirement: Game demos must not use the user-created game soundtrack feature.  1.2-7-7  Must Be Fully Accessible Using Default Controller Requirement: Game demo features must be fully accessible and functional using the region-appropriate default controller. Optionally, demos may also support additional controller types or expansion devices. 1.2-7-8  SDTV 4:3 Mode Only Requirement: The game demo must not use higher resolution HDTV or wide-screen TV modes. 1.2-7-9  Xbox Dashboard Differentiation Requirement: If the game demo includes a shell or a launcher program, its appearance and behavior must be clearly distinct from that of the Xbox Dashboard. Game Demo TCR Exemptions Game demos are exempt from the following TCRs: 3-37 Attract Mode 3-38 Attract Mode Cycle 3-56 Vibration Option 3-60 Game Sound Volume Control Please note that you should consult the latest Xbox Guide for the most recent updates to these TCRs. gd]XR gd]XR o\I\I\I\I\I gd]XR qZAZ*Z*Z*- gd]XR gd]XR @gd]XR gd]XR raJ6J gd]XR lWBWB. |p_SpSpD fO;O(

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox Interactive Demos Frequently Asked Questions Title _PID_HLINKSXbox Interactive Demos Frequently Asked Questions Colin James O'Neill Normal.dot Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 10.0bjbjk  data in exactly the same way.  Do I really need to worry about the parameters passed by the launcher? Yes. It is important that demos behave appropriately within the context of a multiple demo disc with a launcher. For this to work, all demos must follow the rules with regard to the data passed to them. Specifically, all demos must be able to run in kiosk mode (also known as attract mode), all demos must pay attention to the timer and return to the launcher when it has elapsed, and all demos must call XLaunchNewImage to exit in order to call the launcher named in the LAUNCH_DATA structure. What if the timer runs out when I am playing back a non-interactive movie? Finish the playback and then exit. Do I time out if someone is playing? No. The right way to approach the timer is to reset it when there is user input. So if someone is playing a game, the timer never runs out. If they walk off and leave it running with no input, the timer runs down and the demo exits to the launcher. When I exit, should I return the same data I was passed? Yes. The best thing to do is to preserve the LAUNCH_DATA structure you are passed and return the same structure to the launcher unchanged. Why can t my demo find its data files when it launches? The launcher will call your demo using XLaunchNewImage. When this happens, the mapping of the D:\ drive does not change. If you are looking for your data files as if your demo is at the root of D:\, you will not necessarily find them. Demos must not assume they are at the root or in the same level of the structure as the launcher. The name of the demo itself, with full path information, is passed in the LAUNCH_DATA structure. Stripping off the demo name will leave you with a path to your directory location. Details are in the Xbox Interactive Demos Technical Guidelines. What TitleID should I use for the demo? For a demo to work with the launcher, both applications must share the same TitleID. The default for the Xdemos launcher is a TitleID of 0 (zero), and your demo should use this as well. Can my demo access the hard disk?  Demos may only use the utility region of the hard disk. No game-saves or persistent storage is allowed. When you build your application, do not use the XINIT_MOUNT_UTILITY_DRIVE or XINIT_FORMAT _UTILITY_DRIVE flags. Instead, explicitly call XMountUtilityDrive with the bFormatClean flag to initiate access to that region. See the Xbox Guide Technical Requirements section for TCRs 1.2-7-1 and 1.2-7-2. How big can a demo be? For the Xbox Interactive Retail Kiosks, we ask that you aim at 200 MB or less for your interactive demos and 45 seconds in length for non-interactive demos. If your demo will be substantially larger than this, please contact your account manager for approval. For specific OXM restrictions, contact   HYPERLINK "mailto:drees@imaginemedia.com"  drees@imaginemedia.com Can I use electronic file transfer to get the demo to Certification? No. All submissions for Certification must be on approved DLTtape uncher in this case renamed // default.xbe so that it will run on boot-up in  // the emulator or off of a disc. Xdemos.xbe // The launcher again, but with the name to be  // called on exit by the demo.  Xdemos.xdi // A script file that tells the launcher where the  // demo to be run lives on the disc.  /media // Audio and graphics files used by the launcher. /game demo folder // A directory that holds your demo and all of its  // files and subdirectories. The duplication of the launcher is a requirement when testing the demo/launcher combination in the emulator or from a disc. On startup, default.xbe is called. When the demo exits, however, it will launch xdemos.xbe. Thus, both must be present. What goes on the DLT when I submit to Certification? See the answer in the previous FAQ. Use the Xbox Game Disc Layout Tool to place all of the files as shown above. Test this in your emulator to make sure it all works as expected prior to submitting for certification. Do I need to stop all threads prior to calling XLaunchNewImage? Yes. In particular, any disc I/O must be stopped prior to calling XLaunchNewImage. Failure to do so will cause you to fail certification. How do I schedule a certification date? Demos are tested on a first-in, first-out basis as time permits. As such, appointments are not made for individual demos. Contact your account manager to let them know when you plan on submitting your demo.  How long does certification take? Demos take approximately one week to go through the  certification process.  What do the drop-dead dates for the two venues really mean? All final delivery dates are the dates by which all content must be received ready to go on the final disc. If your demo has not already been through certification by the drop-dead date, it will not go on that disc. Also, since individual demos are not scheduled, you need to allow plenty of time to get them through certification.

If the game demo does feature menus (limited or detailed), they should be displayed and should contain an option that can be selected to quit. Game Control Screen: A Game Control Screen is an image of the Xbox Controller with instructions about how to play the game. It should appear when the user starts the demo. This image should clearly read  Press START to continue  and should remain on the screen until the user presses START or A at which point, the demo should start. In-Game Menu: While the user is playing the demo, if START is pressed, an In-Game Menu should appear. The following three options should be provided (with any other options that your demo must provide): View Game Controls   This option brings up the Control Screen. Restart Demo   This option returns the user to the Game Title Screen. Quit to Demos Menu   This option quits the Interactive Demo. Ending a Demo (Features and Availability Screen): Publishers may create an ending screen that states when the final game will be available, contains a list of features in the final game, gives hints, and/or displays any other marketing messages to the player that are pertinent to the demo or final game. From this screen, users will be returned to the launcher interface after a period of time no longer than five seconds. vk]PB7P

Overview Today millions of people around the world play games on consoles. The Microsoft( XbBox(( video game system console from Microsoft will support international features at different levels to give gamers from all over the world the same great Xbox gaming experiencesupport different levels of international features to achieve the best game experience for the international users. The Xbox system software is required to have a very small memory footprint to preserve as much RAM as possible for game usage. Therefore, some Iifull Input Method Editor ()be required to have a small memory footprintnot be supported.However, tto preserve as much RAM as possible for game usage. However, the Xbox game system may support IME to enable address input in Japan, To preserve as much RAM as possible for game usage, the required memory footprint for international features, such as full IME and National Language Support  (NLS) APIs, will be small on the Xbox game system. However, to support any kind of address input in Japan, IME may be supported because there is no way to enter Japanese city names cannot be entered using with Hiragana. The international version  of the Xbox game system will handle the following character sets: German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and French. The Xbox game system will supply a font that contains support for 1252, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji support. This font will be available to title developers with the Xbox Development Kit. Xbox will be released to three markets: United States/North America, Japan, and Europe/rest of the world. Therefore, Xbox must provide great international support for both developers and users, and all features in the product must be designed to support multiple languages. On the other hand, the Xbox system software must have a very small memory footprint to preserve as much RAM as possible for game usage. In consideration of this limitation, the Xbox video game console will not support some international features, such as Input Method Editor (IME) and national language support (NLS) libraries. This document attempts to list the requirements and features needed in the Xbox console to accomplish the goals of international support. The implementation of these features is not within the scope of this document. The details on the actual design of the software are described in the individual feature specifications. Implementing international support requires attention in the following areas: Kernel  File names DLL and resource file support Fonts NLS libraries and locale Xbox Dashboard Game regions System Software Requirements Unicode and 7-bit characters for file-related libraries and 8-bit characters for   versions of libraries. The 7-bit character set is the first 128 Unicode characters which is the same as 7-bit ASCII. The 8-bit character set is the first 256 Unicode characters which is the same as extended ASCII. UTF-8 is supported for online content. Xbox system software will not support any system font for the titles to use. Title developers must provide their fonts with their titles. Kernel The Xbox system software will support both a mixture of only ANSIANSI (A)  and Unicode (W) libraries for various functions and Unicode only. However, the Xbox system software will not support the double byte character set (DBCS). The system will support a combination of   and   libraries.For more information on using the   and   versions of functions in the Xbox Title Libraries (XTL), please see Unicode in the XTL in the XDK help (under Xbox Reference\Xbox System Level Libraries\Strings\String Overview\Unicode in the XTL). Some libraries use Unicode strings to display through the Xbox Dashboard. For example, when the XCreateSaveGame function creates new instances of saved games, it takes Unicode parameters because the Xbox Dashboard must display the strings to users. File-related calls, such as CreateFile, use ANSI. The Xbox system software will support the   which uses ANSI parameters instead of Unicode. Xbox system software will not support DBCS. Online portals and server backends need to support DBCS/Unicode user-provided data. The Xbox game system will not support ANSI and or DBCS code pages. The Xbox game system will run pure Unicode system software. Only W versions of our APIs libraries will be exported. No A versions will be exported. File SystemNames and, File System APIsLibraries TThe Xbox system software will support file names up to 40 characters long. For file names and file paths, developers can use ANSI. Supporting only ANSI in the file system improves performance and reduces memory usage throughout the kernel and the XTL. Developers cannot use Unicode for file names or file paths.8 characters for its file names, followed by a period and a 3-character extension in file names and file paths. There are 79 valid characters to use in file-related libraries. Supporting only 79 characters in the file system improves performance and reduces memory usage throughout the kernel and Xbox libraries.  Note that the fFollowing 17 characters are invalid under the Xbox file system: Control characters in Unicode point from Ux0000 to Ux0020   (quotation mark)   Unicode point Ux0024 * (asterisk)   Unicode point Ux002A + (plus sign)   Unicode point Ux002B , (comma)   Unicode point Ux002C / (slash)   Unicode point Ux002F : (colon)   Unicode point Ux003A ; (semicolon)   Unicode point Ux003B < (less-than sign)   Unicode point Ux003C = (equals sign)   Unicode point Ux003D > (greater-than sign)   Unicode point Ux003E ? (question mark)   Unicode point Ux003F [ (left bracket)   Unicode point 0x005B \ (backslash)   Unicode point 0x005C ] (right bracket)   Unicode point 0x005D | (vertical line)   Unicode point 0x007C Delete control character   Unicode point 0x007F DLL and Resource File Support Xbox system software does not support DLLs or resource files. Developers cannot include DLLs in XE format executables. Not having DLLs available in the system software is relevant to international support because some developers use DLLs when developing PC games in multiple languages. SSome PC game developers store data files, including string tables, in DLLs to load data during the runtime. For exampleTypically, PC game developers who want to creatinge an global international version of their game typically create a main executable file and have DLLs for each language. When the title needs localized portions of data from language-specific executable resources, itand loads them localized portions of data from the language-specific executable resources from the DLLs (one DLL per language). However, developers coming from a PC game background must load the localized data differently for the Xbox game system because it has does not support for resource files or DLLs. For information about how to create an international version of a game for Xbox, see the  International Development Guide. Fonts The Xbox game system will not support any fonts, nor will it provide font rasterizer functionality. If Tthe title developers or publishers must create need any fonts and font rasterizer functionality they need, title developers must create their own. The first version of Xbox for Japanese customers will not support IME is not supported in the first version of Xbox for Japanese customer. We areThe Xbox team is considering IME middleware support in Xbox but has not finalized a decision. The Xbox game system will support long file names up to 255 characters for saving files to the hard disk and to, memory units and the Web. Mixing a languages with two or more languages is allowed but not encouraged. For example, a saved game name can contain both Japanese and English characters.  Mixing languages implies a need to have a font or a collection of fonts to display Unicode characters in the supported languages on the Xbox game system in both the Dashboard and the game title that did the save. It is not necessary to support the full range of Unicode characters, just characters in the supported languages. The Xbox Dashboard will support displaying  of characters from all supported languages. All user interaction with the hard disk is through titles (Xbox Dashboard and games). Titles are responsible for creating valid Unicode file names, as well as for reading and displaying the Unicode file names correctly. NLS APIs Libraries and Locale The XTLhere will provide string sorting libraries but be not n National Llanguage Ssupport (NLS)box itle APIsibraries. The g. The names, parameters, and return values of the string libraries have not been set. The libraries will be released in a future version of the XDKame title developer must handle their own locale specific convention such as displaying date in locale specific format.  Since Because the Xbox game system does not provide any NLS librarieAPIs, game developers should use the following international locale conventions for date, time, decimal symbols, thousands separators, and currency symbols shown in the following tables. A header file may be needed to define some of the locale conventions. Date and Time format (short date and time format) Table 1 Date format by country Country Format France dd/mm/yyyy Germany dd.mm.yyyy Italy dd/mm/yyyy Japan yyyy/mm/dd Spain dd/mm/yyyy SwedenUnited Kingdom yyyy-dd/-mm/yyyy United States mm/dd/yyyy Table 2 Time format by country Country Format 24 hours Special Ccase France tt:mm:ss Germany tt:mm:ss Italy tt:mm:ss Japan tt:mm:ss yes, no Uses both 24-hour and 12-hour formats Spain tt:mm:ss SwedenUnited Kingdom tt:mm:ss United States tt:mm:ss Thousand separator (When displaying memory unit ( blocks ) from the Xbox Dashboard) Table 3 Decimal symbol by country Country Format Decimal Symbol  France 789,00 , (comma) Germany 789,00 , (comma) Italy 789,00 , (comma) Japan 789.00 .

The developer cannot include DLLs in XE format executables. Some PC game developers store data files, including string tables, in DLLs to load data during the runtime. Typically, when the PC game developers create a global version of their PC game, developers create a main executable file and load localized portions of data from the language-specific executable resources from DLLs (one DLL per language). Since there is no resource file and DLL support in the Xbox game system, the developers coming from a PC game background must use a different way to load the localized data. Many console developers create one master executable which loads other per-level executables. On the Xbox game system, however, they should not create multiple XBE files on a DVD so the master XBE file loads code or data from other XBE file to simulate loading localized resources from a DLL with an EXE.  For example, Xbox developers may consider rebooting the machine to another XBE file or opening the XBE file and reading data from it. Instead, Xbox developers should simply use simpler files, such as text files, for storing code or data. Thus, the title can have data files external to the master XBE file that do not have to be signed. Only the Master XBE needs to be signed The Imagebld tool creates an XBE file from a single EXE file. The Xbox development environment will not create an XBE file that is a combination of one EXE file and several DLL files. Also, the Imagebld tool will emit error messages when it detects compiled resources within a source executable. Xbox International Feature support This section explains the Xbox game system s international feature set for the Xbox Dashboard, Xbox Zone online service and general Xbox international features. Virtual Keyboard The Xbox game system will support an on-screen virtual keyboard for users to enter text in Xbox Dashboard. The Xbox game system requires several different types of virtual keyboards to accommodate support of various languages. We will provide a virtual keyboard reference UI for title developers if they choose to use it in their titles. We strongly recommend developers use one common virtual keyboard for Xbox titles. The actual design of the virtual keyboard is still TBD.  There will be different layouts for the international users because of differences in languages but the look of the keyboard will be the same as US English layout. When the user sets his or her language setting, the correct language version of the virtual keyboard will be accessible to the user. US Virtual Keyboard The US English layout supports a to z, A to Z, $, 0   9 and the common symbols. European Virtual Keyboard The European layout supports everything US English layout supports plus accent characters for German, French, Italian and Spanish.  Japanese Virtual Keyboard IME is not supported in the first version of the Xbox game system. Support for IME middleware is TBD. Also, the Xbox game system will not support the Romanji input method like using a US keyboard with the Japanese version of Windows for Japanese customers. Adding a Romanji parser to Xbox will not be done as Japanese customers will be confused because only 25% of Japanese customers owns PCs. Also, users just want to enter characters as fast and easily as possible. To support Japanese, the Xbox game system will support both Japanese and English alphabets (no need to support non-English Latin languages). The Xbox game system will have an on-screen option or use one of the triggers to cycle through Hiragana, Katakana, and English (including numbers). The Japanese version of the virtual keyboard will support English, Hiragana and Katakana for account names, nicknames and saved game names. The Japanese version of the virtual keyboard needs 50 Sounds table for Hiragana and Katakana, smaller version of Hiragana  Kit will provide Virtual Keyboard Reference UI in the future. Xbox Dashboard The Xbox Dashboard will be localized into the following languages: Japanese German Italian Spanish French The Xbox Dashboard supports only Unicode, which . The Dashboard can display all of the characters in all of the supported languages.  The Xbox Dashboard will switch the language settings in the Xbox Dashboard to support true multilingual features, such as displaying contents and user interface (UI) in different languages and displaying regional time and date when the language setting is changed through the Xbox Dashboard interface.  Virtual Keyboard The Xbox video game console will support an on-screen virtual keyboard for users to enter text in the Xbox Dashboard. Several different virtual keyboards are needed to support the different languages. The Xbox team will provide a virtual keyboard reference UI for title developers to use in their titles if they choose. We recommend that developers use one common virtual keyboard for Xbox titles. The actual design of the virtual keyboard is still to be determined. The layouts for the international users will be different because of differences in language characters, but the layout of the keyboard will be the same as the U.S. English layout. Setting the language setting will make the correct language version of the virtual keyboard accessible to the user. Metadata Metadata received from or sent to the hard disk, memory units, or Xbox Zone must be in Unicode. For displayable strings, titles are required to save valid Unicode strings in metadata. Non-Unicode strings in metadata may not display properly in these areas. Default Languages on the Xbox Game Systemand Language Setting Option The default languages for the Xbox video game console are Only English or and Japanese will be the default language for the Xbox game system. The Xbox consoles will be set to English for the European and North American versions and to Japanese for the Japanese version. Users who want to read game content or online content in a different language can use the The Xbox language setting in the Xbox Dashboard allows the user to change the default language to another Xbox-supported languages supported by Xboxto read multiple language version of game content or online content.The user can change the native language setting in the Xbox Dashboard. Parental GuidesControls Parental controls regulate the content that can be viewed on an Xbox console. The controls are set based and movie and game rating systems. However, many different movie and game rating systems are used throughout the world. Some countries use the same rating system as other countries even through they speak different languages. On the other hand, some countries speak the same language but use different rating systems. For example, although Mexico and Argentina are both Spanish-speaking countries, they use different movie and game rating systems. For this reason, the selection of movie and game parental controls in the Xbox Dashboard will be based on the user s country, not onby the user s language. For example, the US and UK have different movie and game parental guides and language alone is not enough information to set the correct parental guide. Only the United States version Tof the Xbox video game systemconsole will support the parental control lockout feature in the United States. Strict government regulation in Europe prohibits the sale of unsuitable DVD titles to minors. The European game rating system is also under the government s strict regulation for the sale of unsuitable game titles to minors. The European version of the Xbox game system relies on Because of thisthe for parental control, Forthea,n version of  due to the strict government regulation. Although there isEuropean countries strong strictly regulatione on the sale of unsuitable DVD titles to minors in Europe, currently there is no parental lockout is incorporated into the DVD media for any of European DVD movies customers currently.  The  game systemthe nited tatesIn the future, if the DVD/Movie parental lockout feature becomesis available on DVD movies for the customers in European customers or in any other region, that region s version of thee Xbox video game console will support the parental lockout feature. Game Titles Currently some of the European countries, such as Italy, Netherlands and Portugal, do not have an official game rating system. Some European countries use the ELSPA parental guide. There is no official game parental guide in Japan. CESA (Computer Entertainment Software Associates) in Japan provides guidelines to classify the games into 3 categories based on content:  The game is OK to be sold in Japan because the game contains no violent content.  The game is OK to be sold in Japan but contains some violent content.  The game is prohibited in Japan because of the violent content. Japanese Publishers do not put codes from CESA on game packages, since they are not ratings. Error Messages Two types of errors occur: one in the development environment and the other within the title (game and Xbox Dashboard) environment. When the error occurs in the title, the title is responsible for the error, including online errors, such as  Your online account is expired  if the title supports online functionality. It is the title s responsibility to localize the error in the title. seven7 nited tates.wW.....iI Game Regions The Xbox game system will support three game regions:Basically there are 3 game regions. They are: United States/North American Japan Europe/rest of the world/Rest of the World. Every title must support at least one of the game regions. If developers wish, they can make their titles support more than one game region.  The Xbox game system will support three game regions: US/North America, Japan, and Europe.  It is up to the title developers or publishers to support game regions. If the title developer or publisher wants to support game region, the title developer can build their title (an XBE file with the ImgBuild tool) with options to create a game region-specific title. During title load time, the Xbox system software will check that the title s region code setting corresponds with Xbox  game system s game region.   Xbox International online supportServices Text sent between Xbox Zone online services and the Xbox console will be in Unicode/UTF-8 format. The Xbox Dashboard supports Unicode and will be able to display the all supported languages, regardless of how many different languages are used together. Online user ID and Password The Xbox Zone s user IDs and passwords must be in the lower 128 characters in the Unicode range (the same code points as in lower ANSI 1252).  All online IDs are limited to 128 characters, which is expected by users. This limit enables users to logon to their accounts without loading specific keyboard support. However, users can use any characters in the supported languages for nicknames.  The Xbox Dashboard, and any multi-player online games that are released in Japanese (which does not support Kanji at this time) and one other market, must be able and required to display these characters. For User IDs and Passwords, use valid characters in lower ANSI 1252. The valid characters set is exactly the same as the valid characters in the Xbox file system. Matchmaking A user in Japan may want to play against only Japanese users because a title is released only in Japan. However, there may be times when a user in Japan wants to play against people in other countries. The player will be given an interface from which to pick the region/locale of the opponent to play against. Also, this locale-level matchmaking should be determined on a title-by-title basis but not mandated across all titles for the Xbox game system. The Xbox Zone will give a choice to select the region/locale that the player wants to play against. Magazine The Xbox Zone online magazine will be in English and will be localized to Japanese, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. The content of the magazine will differ slightly in various game regions or countries because of differences between game types and release schedules. Localization Considerations Multiple language version of game on one DVD The Xbox game system provides an option to select different language settings in the Xbox Dashboard. Since the Xbox game system will support in 6 different languages, it is possible to implement a multiple-language version of a title on one DVD. The title developer can store different language versions of data in language-specific directories on the DVD. For example, the title developer would store all Japanese-specific data such as bitmap files, text files, video files, and audio files in a Japanese-specific directory on the DVD, not compiled into the XBE file. Game developers should consider storing all data files such as video, audio, and textures, outside of XBE file for several reasons: Titles should not include all the data in the XBE file because the total size of the data (for example, a very large introductory video). Localization mistakes in the data file can be corrected simply by modifying the data file without having to recompile the source code. If a third-party localization vendor is used, just the data file can be given to the localization vendor instead of actual source code. Data may be localized before code completion, if possible. The XTL provides a set of libraries to retrieve the current language setting in Xbox. The title can use returned result from these libraries to load corresponding language versions of data from specified locations. For example, to read a texture to display  You are the greatest player!  from a title, a developer creates two language versions (English and German) of the texture and stores it in language-specific directories. The English version of the texture file is stored under  \Data\Texture\US  and the German version of the texture file under  \Data\Texture\DE . The title can call the XTL to retrieve the current language setting of the Xbox game system. The XTL returns   which means that the current language setting of Xbox is German. Then, the title can load the German version of the texture  You are the greatest player!  from the  \Data\Texture\DE  directory. Resources Xbox will not support resource files. Traditionally, PC game developers use resource files to store strings and other data, then create localized versions of resource files to support multiple languages or create language-specific resource files for the game. Because the Xbox game system does not support resource files and DLLs, developers must use different formats to store strings and data. There is no resource model in the Xbox game system, including the Win32 LoadResource function.  The user s country setting is not the same as the language setting in the Xbox Dashboard setting The XbBox Zone will give a choice to select the region/locale that the player wants to play against. The following region/locale options will be given: US/North America Germany Spain France Italy Japan Europe International Support for the Xbox Game System PAGE   PAGE \# "'Page: '#' should this be plural?

It had gotten whacked in a field-hockey game, and my wife wondered if we should go to a doctor. Now, I d injured my fingers plenty of times when I was a kid, and no doctor ever got excited about it; even when I broke two fingers, all the doctor did was tape them together. So I said no, just ice it and let it heal. A couple of days later the finger was really swollen and purple, so we did finally take her to a doctor. The diagnosis: a break clean through the bone, at an angle. That s a type of fracture that tends to slip, and if it did slip, surgery would be needed. They immediately put the finger in a big splint, and told us to come back in a week and see if it needed to be rebroken and pinned. Oops. Fortunately, it didn t slip and surgery wasn t needed. Still, the whole thing just goes to show that sometimes, a good dose of worrying is appropriate. In the context of the Xbox e guts of the box and lay out their data so that it gets maximum memory bandwidth, taking advantage of the banks and pages and partitions and burst modes and addressing quirks for the absolute best performance. Sure, it s painful, but if you do all that hard work, it ll pay off in the end in the form of a faster program. Right? Well, not exactly. Below, I ll give you all the info about Xbox memory architecture you could ever want but the bottom line might come as a surprise. Here s the executive summary: it helps to observe a few simple rules, but for the most part, don t worry about it. Before we dive into details, here are a couple of important takeaways about Xbox memory. Xbox has a single memory pool, shared among all bus masters; this is called a unified memory architecture (UMA for short). Xbox memory is organized as an easy-to-use linear address space. Better yet, this linear layout is the same for all bus masters CPU, GPU (graphics processing unit), APU (audio processing unit), and DMA (direct memory access from the DVD, and to and from the hard disk) so programmers don t have to go through contortions in order to prepare data for/receive data from other bus masters, and data can be interchanged between all bus masters easily. The only minor complications arise with tiling and texture swizzling, as discussed below. Xbox is designed so that memory performance (in terms of both latency and throughput) is fairly consistent regardless of how and where memory is accessed. The idea is that programmers will be more productive if they can concentrate on higher-level issues, and that s what Xbox is designed to support. It is not expected that there will be great advantages to be gained from organizing code and data for maximum memory efficiency, although below we will note a few tips that you might want to keep in mind. Next, we ll explore these points in detail, along with everything else you ever wanted to know about Xbox memory but didn t know who to ask. First, we ll look at an overview of Xbox memory, buses, and the memory controller; next, we ll look at how Xbox linear memory addressing maps to the RAM chips and the performance implications thereof; after that we ll look at memory-related aspects of the CPU; then we ll look at tiling and texture swizzling, which allow more efficient access to memory in certain cases; and finally we ll look at some programming practices that can be helpful in improving memory performance. An overview of chips, buses, and bandwidth Xbox memory architecture consists of an Xbox 733-MHz CPU custom-designed by Intel  Corporation, the Xbox GPU custom-designed by NVIDIA  that contains both the GPU and the memory controller, an the Xbox Media Communications Processor (MCP) that contains the APU and peripheral interfaces, and four blocks of 16-MB DDR SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory), with all bus masters sharing the same memory (UMA), as shown in the following figure. Xbox will probably initially ship with two 2M 32 RAM chips per 16-MB memory block, for a total of 8 RAM chips, but these will be configured so that their performance will be identical to a configuration of four 4M 32 RAM chips; in particular, the number of banks in the eight-chip configuration will be limited to match the four-chip configuration. It is likely although not certain that later revisions of the Xbox hardware will in fact use four chips one 4M 32 chip per bank to reduce cost. The RAM chips run at a 200-MHz memory clock (MCLK). Each 16-MB memory block has an independent bus. The data bus to each memory block is 32 bits (4 bytes) wide, but because DDR chips transfer data on both rising and falling clock edges, each block is capable of transferring 8 bytes per MCLK, for a maximum transfer rate of 1.6 GB/s per block. The memory controller is capable of saturating the memory buses to all four memory blocks in parallel (that is, the memory controller can run all four chip buses flat out simultaneously, and in fact can saturate the CPU, GPU, and peripheral buses at the same time, as well), so the overall maximum memory transfer rate is 6.4 GB/s. This transfer rate assumes that all memory accesses occur with zero page-opening latency (as discussed below), which will not be the case in actual usage, so 6.4 GB/s should be thought of as a theoretical maximum that can be approached but not achieved except in short bursts. Obviously, the performance of Xbox depends heavily on how busy the memory subsystem can be kept. Both the memory controller and the memory-addressing scheme are designed to maximize effective memory bandwidth, in several ways: As discussed below, memory addressing is organized so that sequential accesses through memory frequently move from memory block to memory block, or access multiple blocks simultaneously. The many purposes for which the Xbox UMA memory is accessed drawing pixels, reading and writing depth information, scanning out video data, retrieving triangle, vertex, and texture information, reading and writing CPU data, retrieving sound data tend to provide a wide variety of memory requests for the memory controller to try to parallelize and overlap. Special support is provided for efficient access to texture memory (swizzling) and to frame- and z-buffer memory (tiling), as discussed below. The memory controller is capable of rescheduling accesses for maximum efficiency and, as we will see below, is able to interleave multiple accesses to a single block for maximum performance. Together, these factors automatically make available to games a large percentage of that 6.4 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. Simulations predict that for real games running on Xbox, a minimum of 70 percent of the theoretical data rate will be available in other words, games will have at least 4.5 GB/s of memory bandwidth at their disposal without any special memory-aware programming. This is why Xbox performance programming requires relatively little awareness of memory architecture. The front-side bus (FSB) to the custom-designed CPU runs at 133 MHz, slower than the 200-MHz MCLK. At 64 bits it s twice as wide as an individual memory block bus, but, unlike DDR, it s only clocked off one edge, so the total data transferred per clock is 8 bytes, the same as a single memory block bus. Because the memory block buses run at a higher clock speed, each one separately has higher bandwidth than the FSB. The disparity between memory bandwidth and FSB bandwidth reflects two factors:  (1) the Xbox GPU which processes huge amounts of vertex, texture, and pixel data is the largest consumer of memory bandwidth, and (2) the custom-designed CPU has a 128-KB L2 cache, so many of its memory transactions don t have to go over the FSB. The Xbox GPU also has caching in several forms, as described in the papers about the T&L part of the pipeline and the texture cache, but the Xbox GPU tends to read and write so much data that it needs considerably more bandwidth than the custom-designed CPU. The peripheral bus to the Xbox MCP chip supports 400 MB/s full-duplex that is, 400 MB/s in each direction simultaneously. This bus is used for the same sorts of things that PCI is used for in a PC transferring audio, Ethernet, hard disk, and DVD data to and from memory and USB data as well. Peripheral bus transfers are not an important part of the bandwidth picture; of the peripheral bus masters, only the APU is capable of consuming as much as 1 percent of total memory bandwidth, maxing out with all 256 voices at about 120 MB/s, still less than 2 percent of total memory bandwidth. The peripheral bus is able to specify a priority for each memory request to the memory controller, and is also able to fulfill requests in either direction out of order, whenever data becomes available, which helps the memory controller balance latency and bandwidth for the overall system. The data bus between the memory controller and the GPU is internal to the Xbox GPU chip. Both this bus and the GPU are able to handle the peak 6.4 GB/s that can be produced by the four memory blocks and transferred through the memory controller, so neither the bus nor the GPU imposes any bandwidth constraints on GPU performance. Finally, the memory controller arbitrates and controls the execution of all memory requests on behalf of all bus masters. The memory controller can reschedule memory accesses for better performance; Xbox UMA memory and many bus masters help make this rescheduling highly effective, by providing a variety of concurrent requests of different sorts to be interleaved together. The memory controller is aware of the different needs of the various bus masters and factors them into its arbitration and scheduling. For example, the custom-designed CPU generally uses a relatively small amount of memory bandwidth but is latency critical, since it is often in a stall condition until it gets a response from memory. The Xbox GPU requires a huge amount of memory bandwidth but has relatively high tolerance for latency, due to the depth of the pipeline, which hides memory latency. The APU has very low bandwidth requirements and is generally latency-tolerant but has hard deadlines by which the data must arrive. Consequently, the memory controller prioritizes requests as follows: CPU requests, high-priority peripheral-bus requests, GPU requests, and other peripheral-bus requests. Memory addressing To those who have never encountered the low-level details of memory addressing before, it no doubt seems simple. You have a bunch of addresses, going from lowest to highest. They probably just map directly to how data is stored in the RAM chips. What could be complicated about that? s the way things appear to be from the perspective of the custom-designed CPU, but hardware people and console veterans know that the mapping of CPU addresses to actual RAM storage locations can vary a great deal, depending on how the CPU s memory address lines are connected to the RAM chips. Moreover, there s no requirement that other bus masters, such as the GPU, have their address lines hooked up in the same way, although fortunately on Xbox all bus masters do in fact share the same memory addressing. It all depends on how the hardware designers choose to hook up memory a choice that in turn reflects anticipated bus-master memory access pattern and the internal architecture and performance characteristics of the RAM chips. Consequently, any discussion of Xbox memory addressing is going to be pretty much unintelligible without the proper background, so first let s establish some terminology and review various aspects of memory addressing. This material will also come in handy for understanding memory-related performance issues later on. A quick primer on memory In Xbox memory-addressing lingo, a partition is a memory block (consisting of either one 4M 32 or two 2M 32 RAM chips). The two words are interchangeable for the purposes of this discussion. There are four memory blocks, hence four partitions. Each partition stores 16 MB. Each partition s bus is 4 B wide. However, partitions transfer data on both the leading and trailing edges of the memory clock; moreover, the memory controller is designed so that the basic memory transaction takes a minimum of 2 MCLKs. This means that each memory request spans at least 2 MCLKs and can transfer at least 16 B. One important implication is that from a bandwidth perspective, every memory access costs at least as much as if 16 B had been read or written. The minimum transaction size for the custom-designed CPU is even larger: 32 B, spread over two partitions and 2 MCLKs, reflecting the 32-B size of CPU cache lines. If you re thinking that the custom-designed CPU is able to read and write units smaller than 32 B individual bytes, for instance s true from a program s perspective, but by the time the transaction reaches the RAM chips, it s a 32-B operation. This conversion of smaller transactions to 32 B happens in any of several ways. For CPU-cached memory, CPU memory transactions go through the CPU L1 and L2 caches, which always read and write blocks of 32 B at a time when they have to access memory (on a cache miss or eviction). For reads from non-cached memory, any unneeded bytes out of the 32 bytes read are simply thrown away. For writes to non-cached memory, the memory controller tells the RAM chips to ignore any unneeded bytes out of the 32 bytes written. The bottom line is that, regardless of type, every CPU memory transaction completely occupies two partitions for 2 MCLKs, so from a bandwidth perspective it costs as much as if 32 B had been read or written. (This doesn t, of course, mean that it costs 32 B of bandwidth every time a program does a read or write. For cached memory, the cache avoids many memory transactions and gathers others into 32-B bursts, and for write-combined memory, multiple writes can be gathered into 32-B bursts, as discussed below.)  CPU accesses are not only 32 B in size but are also 32-B aligned. (That is, each CPU access reads or writes a 32-B block of memory starting at an address that s a multiple of 32 B.) This means that 8 B read by the CPU from addresses 1C-23 will actually require that the 64 B from 0-3F be read. A quick note on non-cached memory: the custom-designed CPU supports two sorts of non-cached memory: uncached and write-combining. Write-combining memory can gather up multiple writes to the same aligned 32-B chunk, then write them all to memory in a single operation, thereby saving a great many memory writes and running a lot faster. The only reason to ever use uncached memory rather than write-combining is when it s critical that each CPU write be sent to memory as a separate transaction and in exactly the order that the writes occurred. As of this writing, no such situation exists on Xbox (an uncached address space is used for sending commands to memory-mapped control registers, but these don t involve any physical memory), so you should use write-combining for all memory you never read from (such as push-buffers, vertex buffers, and textures any memory the GPU accesses must be non-cached). Details of cached and write-combining memory on Xbox will be discussed further in another paper; additional information about write-combining memory can be found at   HYPERLINK "http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumII/applnots/244422.htm"  http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumII/applnots/244422.htm A partition can be thought of as a 3-D matrix of rows, columns, and banks. Far from being a convenient fiction, this reflects the actual operation of RAM chips, which are in fact internally addressed via row, column, and bank addresses. Each row consists of a block of 1-K column-addressable bytes. Each of the Xbox partitions contains 16-K rows, with the rows organized into four banks of 4-K rows each, as shown in the following figure: The number in each cell is the address of that byte within its bank. Row #0 in bank 0 covers bytes 0-1023 of that bank; row #1 covers 1024-2047; and so on. Likewise, row #0 in bank 2 covers bytes 0-1023 of bank 2. (Note that these do not correspond to CPU addresses because of the bank and partition bits, which we ll cover shortly.) So at the partition level, a storage location isn t pointed to by a single linear address, but rather by three addresses: bank, row, and column. (Remember, for a given partition the storage locations may be contained in a single 4M 32 RAM chip or spread over two 2M 32 chips, but the two-chip configuration is logically equivalent to and is set up to perform like a single 4M 32 chip.) The details of row, column, and bank addressing are handled transparently to the custom-designed CPU, but are nonetheless important to understand, because memory access times vary considerably depending on access patterns with respect to rows. When a row address is already opened that is, when the row has recently been accessed and the partition has everything set up and ready to go to access that row, awaiting only a column address access proceeds at full speed. However, accessing a new row setting up to access the row from scratch is much slower. The full set of 1-K storage locations addressed by a single row address is typically called a page, rather than a row. On Xbox, opening a page that is, switching to a different row address that is not currently open is expensive, consuming as many as 12 MCLKs. However, any access to a page that is already open will proceed with no delay, at the rate of 8 B/MCLK. Thus, if the memory controller accesses storage location 0, then immediately after accesses storage location 16, the second access will be a page hit and will proceed at full speed. If it then accesses storage location 0xFFFFFF, a new page will have to be opened, which will require a number of MCLKs. Actually, the cost of opening a page can often be partly or entirely hidden, as discussed below, but nonetheless, page hits are generally faster than page misses, and certainly never slower. So the takeaways here are that a page is an aligned 1KB block of storage locations within a partition, and that page hits are good, page misses are bad. As mentioned above, each partition has four banks, each consisting of one-quarter of the pages, yielding a total of 4,096 pages per bank in the case of Xbox. Banks matter because at any given time, exactly one page can be open in each bank, independent of the other banks; thus, up to four pages one from each bank can be open at a time in each partition. If you access a page in bank 0 and then a page in bank 1, immediately afterward both pages would be open, because they are in different banks, and each bank can keep one page open. However, if you were to access a page in bank 0 followed by another page in bank 0, immediately afterward only one of the pages would still be open, because they are in the same bank, and one bank can keep only one page open. How banks map to CPU addresses depends on how the address lines are hooked up to the RAM chips. We ll look at how that works for Xbox shortly. While page misses can take up to 12 MCLKs, their costs can often be partly or completely hidden by the memory controller. This is because a row address can be sent to a partition while data is being fetched from other banks in the same partition, and the operations can proceed in parallel. Obviously, this won t work if all the accesses at a particular time are to the same bank, but given the mix of memory clients in the system, generally there will be mix of banks being accessed and  What this means is that while page hits are never worse and generally better than page misses, page misses are rarely as expensive as they might appear. This, in turn, implies that it rarely makes a significant difference if programmers arrange their memory use for optimum paging. Thus, programmers should as a rule concentrate on higher-level issues and let the memory controller take care of minimizing paging costs. This is especially true because memory addressing is set up so that accesses with good locality will tend to produce a lot of page hits, as we ll see next, so you will get good results simply by following the good practice of packing data so that when any particular area of memory is touched, all or most of the bytes get used. (We ll return to the topic of memory-performance friendly data structuring later.) Notwithstanding, let s take a look at exactly how memory is laid out in Xbox, so you can decide for yourself if you want to try to improve performance by contorting your data structures. Back to Xbox memory addressing Now that we understand partitions and banks and rows and columns, let s see how they work in Xbox. Linear Xbox memory addressing (as opposed to tiled addressing, as discussed below), for all bus masters, is laid out thus: This table shows how the 26 bits of the 64-MB linear memory address that any bus master can specify to the memory controller actually gets routed in order to specify the location of the data to be retrieved. So, for example, bits 3:0 of the linear memory address specify the four least significant bits of the byte column address within whatever partition is being accessed. A good place to start with this figure is to look at how the linear address selects the memory block to be accessed. This is done via the partition field, which specifies which one of the four partitions is to be accessed. The location of this value bits 5:4 of the linear address means that as you go sequentially through the linear address space, a new partition (memory block) is addressed every 16 bytes, and in the course of 64 bytes all four partitions are touched. This 16-B granularity ensures that all but the smallest memory blocks will stretch across multiple partitions, which in turn ensures that the system load for each task will usually be balanced across the four partitions. This avoids large-scale contention between bus masters and provides the memory controller with plenty of opportunity to schedule and interleave accesses to hide the costs of page misses. An important implication of 16-B partitioning is that peak speed for sequential data access is not limited to the 1.6-GB/s throughput of one partition. Accesses move from partition to partition every 16 B, allowing the memory controller to keep multiple partitions busy servicing the requests. In fact, larger memory accesses will use multiple partitions simultaneously; for example, each fetch of a 32-byte-aligned 32-byte vertex will read from two partitions at once. Similarly, every CPU cache miss accesses two partitions, since the custom-designed CPU always reads and writes 32-B blocks. Bits 11:6 of the linear memory address map to the upper part of the column address. In conjunction with the use of bits 5:4 to select the partition and bits 3:0 to specify the low part of the column address, this means that as you walk linearly through any aligned 4-KB block of the address space, you cover 1 K sequential bytes a single page of each partition s address space, cycling through the partitions with a 16-B granularity. An important implication of this is that the overall system page size is 4 KB. In other words, as you access memory linearly starting at a 4 K-aligned boundary, you can go 4 KB while accessing the same four pages, one in each partition. (At the 4-K boundary, you will in short order every 16 B open four new pages, one in each partition.) So now we understand linear addressing of 4-KB chunks of memory every aligned 4-KB block covers exactly one page in each partition, cycling through the partitions every 16 B. Let s see how those pages fit together in the overall address space. The next two address bits, 13:12, are the bank bits, which select which one of the four banks is to be accessed. This location of the bank bits means that a new bank in each of the four partitions is addressed every 4 KB of the linear address space, and all four banks in each partition are cycled through in the course of 16-KB addresses. Thus you could read the 16 addresses 0, 0x10, 0x20, 0x30, 0x1000, 0x1010, 0x1020, 0x1030, 0x2000, 0x2010, 0x2020, 0x2030, 0x3000, 0x3010, 0x3020, and 0x3030 to open all the pages in a 16-KB range, and could then go back and read any or all of the addresses in the range 0-0x3FFF without a single additional page miss (assuming no other bus masters were active at the time). The rest of the linear memory address simply specifies which row within the partition and bank to access, so the 16-KB pattern described above repeats 4 KB times, for a total of 64 MB of memory. The following figure summarizes how linear memory addresses map to partitions, banks, rows (pages), and columns: In the above figure, the numbers shown are the linear addresses at which bus masters such as the CPU see the storage locations that are located at various bank, row, and column addresses in the four partitions. Ellipses ( ) show contiguous ranges; tildes ( ) show that the row s pattern is repeated many times. Another way to look at this is to walk through bus-master-visible linear addresses and see what partitions, banks, rows, and columns we find there: s not necessary that you understand the mapping of linear addresses to RAM chip internals in detail. The important point is that memory addresses cycle between partitions every 16 B and between banks every 4 KB, so bandwidth and page-miss loads automatically get distributed across multiple memory blocks and multiple banks maximizing available bandwidth, providing good opportunity for hiding page misses, and keeping performance consistent for all but pathological access patterns. Now that we have a basic understanding of linear memory addressing and its characteristics, we can move on to the other available memory addressing scheme, tiled addressing. Tiled memory addressing Linear memory addressing is the workhorse mode for Xbox, but there s one task for which it s less than ideal storing pixel and depth buffers. This is because rasterization is a 2-D operation in screen space (all the more so because Xbox rasterizes triangles in a wide, S-shaped path called a swath rather than one scan line at a time), while linear addressing makes for very good 1-D locality but poor 2-D locality. For example, consider the rasterization of the following triangle to a linear 32-bpp, 640 480 buffer (each rectangle represents one 1 pixel, controlled by 4 bytes of the frame buffer; addresses run sequentially across each row and off the right until the right edge of the screen, then continue with the next row down): Although this triangle draws only 9 pixels, it touches three different pages of memory (remember, pages are 4 KB each, spread over four partitions), incurring three expensive page misses and most likely reducing performance as a result. Worse, a page miss will be incurred, on average, for every 1.6 scan lines in height of every primitive drawn. Surely there s a better way. Indeed there is. Tiled memory addressing which (unlike swizzling, to be discussed later) is a true memory addressing mode, implemented in the memory controller reorganizes the mapping of memory addresses to pages (and to partitions, as well) for improved 2-D page (and partition) coherence and load balancing. Rather than extending hundreds of pixels horizontally but only a couple of pixels vertically, pages addressed with tiled memory addressing are reasonably close to square. s how it works. Xbox supports eight tiled memory regions, two of which (the regions with index numbers 0 and 1) are typically used for the pixel and depth buffers. Each tiled region may be as large as desired, and may contain any number of surfaces. In fact, tiling doesn t directly have anything to do with surfaces; it s just a characteristic of a range of memory, specifying that the memory controller should address the memory in a tiled fashion. We ll discuss what  in a tiled fashion  means shortly. A tiled region is set up automatically for the primary pixel buffer, and, if EnableAutoDepthStencil is set, for the depth buffer as well. (The pixel buffer is tiled region 0, and if the depth buffer is autocreated via EnableAutoDepthStencil, it will be tiled region 1.) Alternatively, a tiled region can be created by calling SetTile(DWORD Index, D3DTILE* pTile)  D3DTILE is defined as follows: typedef struct _D3DTILE     DWORD   Flags;     void*   pMemory;     DWORD   Size;     DWORD   Pitch;     DWORD   ZStartTag;     DWORD   ZOffset; } D3DTILE; SetTile() is not synchronized to the push-buffer, and so always takes effect immediately at the time of the API execution. Consequently, it is the caller s responsibility to ensure that the GPU is no longer referencing tiled memory when the corresponding region is made tiled or untiled via SetTile(). This may be done via BlockUntilIdle() or IsBusy(). SetTile() is intended for use only with surfaces created in contiguous memory via D3D_AllocContiguousMemory() and registered with D3D via Register(). If pTile is NULL, or if pMemory is NULL, the tile is disabled. If pTile is non-NULL and pMemory is non-NULL, the tile is enabled and configured according to D3DTILE. A tile must be disabled before it can be re-enabled. Only tiled memory regions support depth compression; linear memory cannot support it. This is related to the packet-based layout of tiled memory, as described below. Depth compression is enabled when D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZCOMPRESS is set in Flags. Besides D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZCOMPRESS, the other flags are D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER, D3DTILE_FLAGS_Z32BITS, and D3DTILE_FLAGS_Z16BITS. D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER is discussed below, and the other two flags simply specify the type of depth buffer, if any, that will be stored in the tiled region. Note that pMemory indicates the linear memory address at which the tiled region should begin. The use of ZStartTag and ZOffset, which control the mapping of compression tags to the tiled region when compression is enabled, is discussed in the  Depth-buffer compression and performance implications  paper. That paper discusses compression in detail, including the functioning of the compression tags, so that won t be covered here; however, the exact mapping of compression tags to memory will be discussed below. Tiled regions must start at alignments of D3DTILE_ALIGNMENT (16 KB) and must be a multiple of D3DTILE_ALIGNMENT in size. They should also almost always be a multiple of pitch*16 in size; as we ll see later, this ensures that there are no partial tile rows within the region. (The pitch*16 limitation is a guideline, not a requirement, but, as discussed below, there are some hardware-dependent ways in which you can potentially run into problems for example, inadvertently addressing memory outside the region if size isn t a multiple of pitch*16 and you don t know exactly what you re doing, so I d recommend following the guideline unless you have a compelling reason not to.) Pitches are of the form: pitch = k * 2 ^ n where k is 1, 3, 5, or 7; n is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15; and 0 100 < pitch < 0x10000. For a 32-bpp 640x480 mode, the pitch would be 5 * 2 ^ 9 = 2560. Thus, 26 pitches are supported, as follows: D3DTILE_PITCH_0200 D3DTILE_PITCH_0300 D3DTILE_PITCH_0400 D3DTILE_PITCH_0500 D3DTILE_PITCH_0600 D3DTILE_PITCH_0700 D3DTILE_PITCH_0800 D3DTILE_PITCH_0A00 D3DTILE_PITCH_0C00 D3DTILE_PITCH_0E00 D3DTILE_PITCH_1000 D3DTILE_PITCH_1400 D3DTILE_PITCH_1800 D3DTILE_PITCH_1C00 D3DTILE_PITCH_2000 D3DTILE_PITCH_2800 D3DTILE_PITCH_3000 D3DTILE_PITCH_3800 D3DTILE_PITCH_4000 D3DTILE_PITCH_5000 D3DTILE_PITCH_6000 D3DTILE_PITCH_7000 D3DTILE_PITCH_8000 D3DTILE_PITCH_A000 D3DTILE_PITCH_C000 D3DTILE_PITCH_E000 For best performance, any surface created in a tiled memory region should generally have the same pitch as the region. When multisampling is used, the surface pitch is in terms of the multisampling buffer width, so it s twice the pixel width; thus, for multisampling with a 640 480 front buffer resolution and 32-bpp, the pitch would be 0 1400 as opposed to the non-antialiased 0 0A00 pitch. Note that, due to software limitations, the pitch of a surface can currently only be up to 16 KB, which means you can t create a surface that matches a tiled region with a larger pitch than that. This may change on the final hardware, however. GetTile() obtains information on a tiled memory region. How pages are addressed within tiled memory regions To the CPU or GPU, memory addresses for a tiled memory region look exactly like memory addresses for a linear memory region, starting at the base address of the region and steadily increasing. Consequently, from a programming perspective both linear and tiled memory look the same. (It is possible to expose the underlying differences to software, as described below, but this is very rarely necessary.) The difference lies in the way that those addresses map to physical RAM, which in turn has major implications for the efficiency of various types of memory accesses; in particular, tiled memory is efficient for 2-D rasterization. In terms of CPU- and GPU-visible memory addresses, each page in a tiled memory region is a rectangle which I ll call a tile s 256 bytes wide and 16 scan lines high. (Recall that each page is 4 KB in size, of which 1 KB lies in each of the four partitions.) In order to cover the width of the tiled region, (pitch/256) tiles are lined up next to each other. Thus, here s how a tiled memory region containing a 256 16 32-bpp buffer would look, and how the CPU/GPU-visible memory addresses fall within those tiles. (In this discussion, both page and tile numbers are relative to the start of the tiled memory region, so page 0 is the page starting at pMemory, and likewise for tile 0. As we ll see, the tile order and the page order aren t necessary identical, although they are in the above figure.) Of course, the CPU and GPU neither know nor care what page or tile any given address is stored in; they just see normal addresses from pMemory to pMemory + Size   1. The page/tile organization is only important in terms of how it affects performance. (The same goes for intra-page organization; in a little while, we ll look at how CPU- and GPU-visible addresses within each page map to the RAM chips themselves.) The memory above is shown as 2-D, with scan lines and a pitch, because tiled memory is used for pixel and depth buffers, and sometimes for textures, all of which are 2-D data structures with scan lines and pitches. This 2-D presentation is not strictly necessary, since functionally speaking tiled memory is really just a 1-D array of addresses, but since the whole point of tiling is to make 2-D data structures efficient, it makes sense to discuss it in a 2-D framework. Things get just a little trickier for the next 16 scan lines. For all pitches except 0 300, 0 500, and 0 700 (which I ll discuss separately), the least-significant bit of the page address is flipped, so in terms of mapping to tiles, odd and even pages swap order, as follows (again for a pitch of 1 KB): As you can see, this pattern continues throughout the buffer, with even-numbered rows of tiles having monotonically increasing page numbers, and odd-numbered tile rows swapping the order of each pair of pages. In case you re wondering why odd and even pages are swapped on every other tile row, think back to the earlier discussion of banks; the swapping makes sure that rasterization moves to a different bank of memory every time it moves to a different tile, preventing the rasterizer from hogging a single bank. The different colors in the above figure denote the four banks; as you can see, adjacent tiles are always in different banks. Without the page swapping, in the above figure page 4 would be below page 0, and likewise for page 8 and so forth; since all those pages are in the same bank, the rasterizer could draw a rectangle 256 B wide by 480 scan lines high without ever leaving that bank, with dire load-balancing implications for the memory subsystem. (This particular issue doesn t actually apply for 640 480 32-bpp mode, but is important for any tiled region that s a multiple of four tiles in width.) Now we can see why tiling makes for efficient page accesses. The rectangular shape of the tiles makes for good page coherence during 2-D rasterization, and the alternating layout of the banks makes for good load balancing across banks. There is one exception to the above description, and that s when a region is created with D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER (which, despite the name, can be used with any tiled region, not just regions containing z-buffers). In this case, it s even tile rows that swap odd and even pages, as follows: The reason for this should be obvious; it keeps the pixel and depth buffers which are typically the same size and pitch and are consequently accessed at identical offsets relative to the starts of their respective tiled regions during rasterization from constantly contending for the same bank. You should always make sure that either your pixel buffer or your depth buffer, but not both, have this flag set. As a final example, here s how the top 64 scan lines of a tiled memory region containing a 640x480 32-bpp buffer are laid out: s how the same region would look if it was created with D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER: If you ll recall, earlier I mentioned that three pitches 300, 0 500, and 0 work differently with respect to the swapping of even and odd pages on every other tile row. The reason there s a difference is that out of the 26 pitches, these three are the only ones that have an odd number of tiles per row; this means that there s a leftover tile per row that has no partner to swap with, so the above-described page-swapping algorithm won t work. The solution for these three specific pitches is to entirely discard the concept of swapping pages on every other tile row; by default, for these three pitches only, pages just increase steadily across each row and from the right end of one row to the start of the next. This doesn t cause any problems with rasterization hogging a particular bank, because the odd number of pages per row means that neighboring pages are always in different banks. Here s how the pages in a region with a pitch of 768 are laid out by default: If D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER is specified for a pitch of 0 300, 0 500, or 0 700, then every pair of even/odd pages swaps throughout the region. This includes pairs where one page is at the end of one row and the other page is at the start of the next row. Here s how the pages in a region with a pitch of 768 are laid out when D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER is specified: Normally, I d provide a figure showing exactly how the page address bits map. I haven t done that here because it s unusually complex, and different for every pitch. Instead, after I ve discussed intra-tile addressing, I ll provide C code to show the complete mapping of tiled addresses to linear addresses.  How memory is addressed within pages in tiled regions Now that we understand how pages are laid out within tiled regions, we need to look at how memory is laid out within each one of those pages/tiles. The intra-page layout is designed to provide both good memory locality and good load balancing across partitions for 2-D accesses, and as a result is quite complex. However, the layout is the same for every page of tiled memory, simplifying matters somewhat. The fundamental unit of a tiled page is the packet. (Not coincidentally, the packet is also the basic unit of depth compression, as discussed in  Depth-buffer compression and performance implications. ) A packet is a 64-byte chunk of memory in a tiled region, covering a 4 4 aligned square of depth values in a 32-bit buffer (or an 8 4 aligned rectangle in a 16-bit buffer). The 64 bytes in a single packet form a linear segment of memory in one partition; thus, a packet can be accessed with a single contiguous 64-byte read from or write to a single partition. The packets within a page/tile are laid out as follows, where each rectangle represents a single packet, and the color and number denote the partition the packet is from: s easy to see why this is a good layout for 2-D accesses. Each packet is symmetric in 2-D, so rasterization tends to make good use of each 64-byte block from a single partition no matter what the shape of the primitive. This is helped by the S-shaped pattern in which Xbox rasterizes. Also, as discussed in  Xbox Pixel Shader Performance,  the four-way rasterization parallelism on Xbox operates on aligned 2 2 blocks called quads, so each packet consists of four neatly packed quads. Similarly, occlusion culling operates on packets, rejecting up to 16 pixels per clock. Furthermore, when rasterization crosses a partition boundary, it moves to a different partition no matter which boundary it crosses. Thus, the rasterization load is automatically balanced across the partitions. s really more than you need to know to use tiled memory effectively. In general, you should not have to worry about the layout of tiled memory at all; I m providing the information only because a number of people have inquired about it. Basically, the tiling hardware automatically gives you good 2-D coherence, as well as load balancing across banks and partitions, without any action on your part. Unless for some reason you want to access tiled memory without the help of the tiling hardware (which we ll describe how to do later), none of the above knowledge should have any impact on how you program. For completeness, however, here s exactly how tiled memory addresses map to linear addresses. The two following routines perform tiled-to-linear and linear-to-tiled address translation: #define GETFIELD(value, upper, lower) \     ((value >> lower) & ((2L << (upper-lower))-1)) DWORD TiledToLinear(D3DTILE *pTile, DWORD tiled_address)     DWORD pitch = pTile->Pitch;     DWORD tiled_region_base_address = (DWORD)pTile->pMemory;     BOOL fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER = !!(pTile->Flags & D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER);     DWORD tiled_offset =         (tiled_address & ~0xf0000000) - (tiled_region_base_address & ~0xf0000000);     DWORD scan = tiled_offset / pitch;     DWORD column = tiled_offset % pitch;     DWORD width_in_pages = pitch / 256;     DWORD page_row = scan / 16;     DWORD page = (page_row * width_in_pages) + (column / 256);     // handle 0x300, 0x500, 0x700 pitches     DWORD odd_number_page_slots = (pitch / 256) & 0x01;     if(odd_number_page_slots)     {         page ^= fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER;     }     else     {         DWORD odd_page_row = page_row & 0x01;         if((!fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER && odd_page_row) ||             (fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER && !odd_page_row))         {             page ^= 0x01;         }     }     DWORD scan_within_page = (tiled_offset / pitch) % 16;     DWORD column_within_page = tiled_offset % 256;     DWORD scan23 = (GETFIELD(scan_within_page, 2, 2) << 1) +                    GETFIELD(scan_within_page, 3, 3);     DWORD linear_offset_within_page =         (GETFIELD(scan_within_page, 3, 2) << 10) |         (GETFIELD(column_within_page, 7, 6) << 8) |         (GETFIELD(scan_within_page, 1, 0) << 6) |         (((GETFIELD(column_within_page, 5, 4) + scan23) & 0x3) << 4) |         GETFIELD(column_within_page, 3, 0);     DWORD linear_address_of_page_start = tiled_region_base_address + (page * 0x1000);     DWORD linear_memory_address = linear_address_of_page_start +                                   linear_offset_within_page;     return linear_memory_address; DWORD LinearToTiled(D3DTILE *pTile, DWORD linear_address)     DWORD pitch = pTile->Pitch;     DWORD tiled_region_base_address = (DWORD)pTile->pMemory;     BOOL fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER = !!(pTile->Flags & D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER);     // page relative to the start of the tiled region     DWORD page = (linear_address - tiled_region_base_address) / 0x1000;     DWORD width_in_pages = pitch / 256;     DWORD page_row;     // handle 0x300, 0x500, 0x700 pitches     DWORD odd_number_page_slots = (pitch / 256) & 0x01;     if(odd_number_page_slots)     {         page ^= fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER;         page_row = (page / width_in_pages);     }     else     {         page_row = (page / width_in_pages);         DWORD odd_page_row = page_row & 0x01;         if((!fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER && odd_page_row) ||             (fD3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER && !odd_page_row))         {             page ^= 0x01;         }     }     DWORD column = (page % width_in_pages) * 256;     DWORD tiled_offset_of_page_start = (page_row * pitch * 16) + column;     DWORD scan_within_page =         (GETFIELD(linear_address, 11, 10) << 2) |         GETFIELD(linear_address, 7, 6);     DWORD linear1011 = (GETFIELD(linear_address, 10, 10) << 1) +                        GETFIELD(linear_address, 11, 11);     DWORD column_within_page =         (GETFIELD(linear_address, 9, 8) << 6) |         (((GETFIELD(linear_address, 5, 4) - linear1011) & 0x3) << 4) |         GETFIELD(linear_address, 3, 0);     // full tiled memory address corresponding to the linear memory address     DWORD tiled_memory_address =         tiled_region_base_address +         tiled_offset_of_page_start +         (scan_within_page * pitch) +         column_within_page;     return tiled_memory_address | 0xf0000000; The following figure illustrates the above mapping within a page/tile. Here the address ranges in each packet show the linear addresses (relative to the start of the page/tile) that map to each 16-byte scan line of the packet. s complex and messy, but you should never have to worry about mapping between tiled and linear unless you need to access data stored in a single memory area using both memory-addressing schemes. Otherwise, tiled memory automatically provides efficient memory access for pixel and depth buffers. For completeness, let s take a quick look at how tiled memory addresses map to physical memory. Basically, it s exactly the same as the above tiled-to-linear mapping, except that the values that become bits 4 and 5 of the linear address instead become the partition select bits, and the values that become bits 6 and up of the linear address shift down 2 bits to become bits 4 and up of the physical address. Thus, the intra-page mapping of tiled offsets to physical memory is as follows: The partition addressed (in the range 0 3) is: and the 10-bit offset from the start of the page/tile within that partition is:  means  scan within page/tile,  and  Column  means  column within page/tile. ) Note that the sum that results in the partition selection is calculated as a 2-bit sum, the carry from which is lost. Note also that   in the sum is not a typo; these bits are reversed before they re added to Column 5:4 to form the partition select value. The figure below shows the effect produced by this mapping. The top number in each rectangle below is the partition number, and the two bottom numbers indicate the range of memory addresses in that partition that form that packet. (To reinforce that last point the addresses are not CPU-visible linear or tiled addresses, but rather physical addresses within the corresponding partitions.)  Accessing tiled memory regions using tiled and linear addressing You can access tiled memory from the CPU using LockRect() with the D3DLOCK_TILED flag; in this case, the tiling hardware takes care of all addressing complications for you. If you wish, you can also access tiled memory using linear memory addressing by calling LockRect() without D3DLOCK_TILED. The only reason I can think of that you might consider doing so is that CPU memory accesses to tiled memory are faster when using linear addressing, quite a bit faster in the case of reads. However, if you do this, the contents of tiled memory will appear scrambled in the linear view, and you must deal with the complications of mapping from tiled to linear addresses without the help of the tiling hardware. There are no such performance issues or other complications when the Xbox GPU accesses tiled memory; it always uses the correct mapping, and always gets full-speed memory access. While we re on the topic of having the CPU access tiled memory directly, I should emphasize that in terms of performance, it s generally very, very bad to read tiled memory directly. There s a double whammy: first, tiled memory is write-combining, which, while great for CPU writes, is very slow for CPU reads; second, the aperture through which tiled CPU reads occur performs tiled reads very slowly, as PCI transactions; only one such read can be outstanding at a time, so the CPU is exposed to full memory latency on tiled reads. Let me take a moment to explain exactly what I mean by  very slowly  and  very, very bad the bandwidth for tiled (as opposed to linear) CPU reads from tiled memory is about 7 MB/sec. Not that doing linear CPU reads from tiled memory is any treat either sure, it s more than an order of magnitude faster than tiled reads, but that s still only 100 250 MB/sec, depending on the order in which memory addresses are read. If you really need to have the CPU read from tiled memory, you d do better to have the GPU blt the data to a buffer in untiled memory, performing the conversion from tiled to linear addressing in the process (although the memory would still have to be uncached, since the GPU can t blt to cached memory), and have the CPU read from there. Any depth-buffer packet that the CPU writes to through a tiled aperture (that is, through memory locked with D3DLOCK_TILED) is automatically made uncompressed as the write is performed. However, any packet in tiled, compressible memory that is written to by the CPU when it s locked as linear (that is, when it s locked without D3DLOCK_TILED) is not automatically made uncompressed. Instead, the CPU write will alter the depth data without changing the state of the corresponding compression tag (as discussed below). This can leave the memory garbled, because the tags for any blocks that were compressed before the write would still indicate compression, even though the data was not compressed as it was written. Thus you should perform linear writes to tiled memory only if you know exactly what you re doing, and are prepared to write the correct values to the compression tags as well as to the depth buffer. Tiled memory regions that aren t a multiple of pitch*16 in size Earlier, I mentioned that the size of a tiled memory region must be a multiple of D3DTILE_ALIGNMENT (16 KB) in size. I also mentioned that, as a general rule, size should be a multiple of pitch*16 in size as well, but that this was a guideline, not an unbreakable rule. I will now explain this in more detail. At the hardware level, tiled memory regions are composed of 16KB allocation units, each of which is 1024 16. To illustrate what this means, consider allocating a tiled memory region of pitch 0 600 and size 32 KB. You might think you d get a region shaped something like this: However, you will in fact get a tiled memory region shaped like this: Thus, you cannot allocate a size other than a multiple of pitch*16 and expect to be able to access the full width of the bottom row of tiles. s actually worse than that, though. When the GPU accesses memory, the hardware first has to decide whether to use linear or tiled addressing, and it does so based on a logical address calculated as follows: logical_address =  tiled_region_base_address + x * bytes_per_pixel + y * pitch (For tiled CPU accesses, the logical address is simply the CPU-visible address.) This address is compared to the range defined by the start and length of the tiled region. If the address falls in that range, then tiled translation is performed; if not, linear translation is performed. s the kicker: when you have a partial row of tiles, as in the above figure, the way in which the logical address is calculated and the fact that it s the logical rather than tiled address that s compared to the tiling range means that addresses in the bottom part of each partial-row tile are treated as linear, not tiled. This is because the decision about whether to use tiled or linear addressing is made on a linear address basis, as described in the above equation, but the actual access to tiles is done on a tiled address basis. As a result, addresses which seem like they are in the bottom of the partial-row tiles will map to addresses outside the tiled memory region (for example, scan line 31, pixel 0, will be treated as linear address 31*1536*4, and will fall not in page 7 but in page 11, which isn t part of the tiled region) and the bottom part of each partial-row tile will be inaccessible. In short, access to a partial tile row is not going to produce desirable results, even if you try to avoid accessing the missing tiles. If that doesn t make any sense to you, don t worry. All you need to know is that if you create a tiled memory region that has a size that isn t a multiple of pitch*16, you will have a partial bottom row of tiles, and bad things are likely to happen if you access that partial row via the GPU, or via tiled addressing from the CPU. You will never run into any problems of this sort if you simply make all tiled regions multiples of both pitch*16 and 16 KB in size. However, you can, if you wish, allocate a tiled memory region with a size other than a multiple of pitch*16; you just need to avoid accessing the partial bottom row of tiles. Why might you want to do this? The best reason I can think of is to save a little memory for certain odd-sized regions. Suppose you want a 1536 16 tiled memory region. You can t create a tiled memory region of exactly that size, because it s not a multiple of 16 KB. Allocating a tiled memory region of 1536 32 (following the guideline of always having size be a multiple of pitch*16) would require an entire row of unused tiles, totaling 24 KB of wasted space. However, a size of 32 KB, as in the example in the figure above, results in a partial bottom row of tiles, but wastes only 8 KB. As long as accesses are confined to scan lines 0 15, this approach will save memory while avoiding the problems that can arise from partial tile rows. If, however, access is performed to any scan line greater than 15, bad things will almost certainly result. Use tiled memory regions only when appropriate Tiled memory is the best choice for pixel and depth buffers, but should generally be avoided for storing other types of data. The tiled memory organization that makes for excellent 2-D coherence works far less well for data structures that don t involve 2-D locality, such as arrays and vertex buffers and such. One use other than pixel and depth buffers for which tiled memory regions can be appropriate is for some DXTC textures. This is discussed further later, as part of the discussion of DXTC textures. Another possible use is for textures to which you are rendering (which are, of course, pixel buffers while they re being rendered to), which raises some surprisingly complex issues with respect to performance. There are three options when rendering to a texture: render to an image texture in tiled memory and then use that as a texture (which makes for faster rendering but slower texturing than swizzled textures in linear memory); render directly to a swizzled texture in linear memory (which makes for slower rendering but faster texturing) render to an image texture in tiled memory and then blt the result to a swizzled texture in linear memory (which makes for faster rendering and faster texturing, but requires a blt and uses more memory). (Image and swizzled textures are discussed in detail below.) Which of the above approaches is better depends on factors such as the type of rendering (for example, the degree of overdraw), the texture size, the number of times each rendering of the texture will be textured from, and how tight the memory footprint is. Tiling notes Tiling is handled correctly and transparently for blts from and to tiled memory. However, compression will not be performed by blts to compressed tiled memory; although tiling will otherwise be handled properly on such blts, the result will be a completely uncompressed buffer. Peripheral bus masters, such as the IDE and Ethernet controllers, can write to memory using either linear or tiled memory addressing, but can use only linear addressing to read from memory. This is only significant if you need to stream data (presumably precalculated pixel or depth values) directly into a tiled buffer. Compression tags For tiled memory regions that have depth compression enabled, the compression state of each packet is controlled by a corresponding bit in the compression tag RAM; that bit is set to 1 if the packet is compressed and 0 if it is not compressed. There are D3DTILE_MAXTAGS (76800) bits (9600 bytes) of compression tag RAM. The range of tag bits that maps to the packets in a given tiled region is controlled by the ZStartTag field of D3DTILE. This field specifies the bit offset in tag RAM of the start of the tag range to map to the tiled region being created, and must be a multiple of 256. It is possible to have a compressed tiled region for which there are insufficient tag bits, in which case the ZOffset field of D3DTILE controls which tag bits map to which packets. ZOffset is a linear-address byte offset, and must be a multiple of D3DTILE_ALIGNMENT (16KB); this means that the point in the region at which compression tags start being used can be adjusted with a minimum granularity of four pages. See the paper  Depth-buffer compression and performance implications  for details on depth compression in general. In this paper, I m going to focus on the mapping of tag bits to packets, which is as follows. There are actually four separate 2400-byte tag RAMs, one for each partition. If you think back to the above discussion of the layout of tiled memory within a 4-KB page/tile, you ll recall that each page consists of 64 packets. Moreover, you ll recall that those 64 packets are organized as 16 4 1 sets of 4 packets, with each set of 4 packets containing one packet from each partition. The tag RAM for each partition can be viewed as an array of 16-bit WORDs, each one containing the tag bits for the 16 packets in that partition for one page/tile. However, there s a slight trick to how these WORDs map, as follows. Recall that each page/tile in a tiled memory region is a 256-byte-by-16-scan-line rectangle. Also recall that on every other page/tile row, odd and even pages swap. The tag mapping ignores this swapping; the mapping is not to pages, but rather to tiles. Unlike pages, tiles start at 0 at the start of the tiled memory region, and increase in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,   across the top row of pages (16 scan lines high), and continue to increase steadily across the second and succeeding rows of pages, with no odd/even swapping and paying no attention to D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFERS. The following figure shows the tile numbers for the first four rows of pages in a 640 480, 32-bpp tiled memory region: In the following discussion, whenever I refer to a tile, I implicitly mean whatever page happens to be addressed in that tile. For a pixel buffer, tile 0 would refer to page 0; for a depth buffer (with D3DTILE_FLAGS_ZBUFFER set), tile 0 would refer to page 1, because even and odd pages swap positions on even rows of pages. Thus, you can get the WORD containing the partition M tag bits for tile N (relative to the start of the tiled region) like so: tag_bits_for_tile(N) = partition_tag_RAM_M[ZStartTag + N]; where partition_tag_RAM_M is the tag RAM for partition M, viewed as an array of WORD values. (Note that ZOffset can affect this calculation in certain cases, as discussed earlier.) The following figure illustrates this (the tile numbers are relative to the start of the tiled memory region, and the WORD numbers are relative to ZStartTag, with the assumption that ZOffset is unused or 0): Thus, the first 16 bits of the partition 0 tag RAM contain the tags for that partition s packets in tile 0 of the tiled memory region, the next 16 bits contain the tags for tile 1, and so on. Within a page/tile, the tag bits map to packets as follows: The compression tag bits can be read through GetTileCompressionTags(), and can be set through SetTileCompressionTags(). (Note: these APIs are not available in publicly distributed releases as I write this, but should be available soon.) Be aware that access to the tag bits is not particularly fast. First, the access functions have to wait for the graphics pipeline to be idle before proceeding. Second, reading and writing the tag bits occurs through a relatively slow path: about 34 MB/sec for writes, and about 5.7 MB/sec for reads. There are 19,200 packets per 640 480 32-bpp screen, requiring 2400 compression tag bytes, so it takes about 70  s to set the tags for an entire screen, apart from the cost of waiting for idle. Texture addressing: image, swizzled, and DXTC textures From a memory layout perspective, the texture unit supports three different texture types: image, swizzled, and DXTC. Image textures are basically just normal bitmaps; there s nothing complicated about them, as we ll see shortly. DXTC textures use the standard Microsoft  DirectX  texture-compression scheme; the compression itself is a bit complex, but in terms of memory layout DXTC textures are pretty straightforward; we ll talk about them later. That leaves swizzled textures, which have by far the most complicated memory layout of the three, and which we will consequently spend the most time discussing. First, however, we ll cover the simplest textures, image textures. Before we begin, I d like to introduce the concept of the texture cache, which stores recently accessed texture data. The texture cache is 8-KB, 4-way set associative, with 128 64-B cache lines. As you d expect, when the texture unit needs a texel, it looks in the texture cache first, and if it finds the texel there, texture mapping can proceed with no delay. Otherwise, the cache line containing the missing texel has to be loaded from memory before texturing can proceed, slowing pixel processing considerably. (Actually, each cache line is sectored, capable of lazily loading 16 B or 32 B on demand, depending on texture format, but that doesn t matter for the current purpose of discussing texture types.) Why are there multiple texture types? Why not just use image textures for everything, since they re simplest? There are multiple texture types for two reasons: size and performance. DXTC textures, being compressed, have a smaller memory footprint than image or swizzled textures. They also improve performance, because they use less memory bandwidth in correspondence to the degree of compression. (Note that palettized textures are also compressed versus equivalent non-palettized textures; palettized textures may be in either swizzled or image format.) Apart from bandwidth per texel, performance issues with texture types arise because textures are 2-D constructs (2-D textures are, anyway; we ll get to 3-D textures later), and tend to be accessed with good 2-D locality. That is, if a texel is read, it s very likely that nearby texels will also be read soon, where  nearby  refers to surrounding texels in all directions up, down, left, right, combinations thereof not just along one axis, as would be the case for a 1-D texture, for example. Keeping that 2-D locality in mind, let s examine two aspects of Xbox that determine how quickly texels can be fetched. One such aspect, which we covered in detail above, is memory paging. As you ll recall, memory accesses to pages that are already open are faster than accesses to pages that aren t open. In light of the 2-D locality of texture fetching, the ideal relationship of texels to pages would be the following: given that a particular texel has been fetched from a page, we d like to be able to go as far as possible, on average, in any direction through the texture without leaving that page. (Since pages from the four partitions are interleaved every 16 B, here we re talking about staying within the 4 KB covered by four pages, one from each partition.) Likewise, we d like to be able to go as far as possible in any direction through the texture without touching another page in the same bank. The second aspect that affects texel-fetch speed is the texture cache. Just as with pages, given a particular texel that s been fetched from a cache line, we d like to get able to go as far as possible, again on average, in any direction through the texture without leaving that cache line. Finally, we d like to see these properties hold for all mipmap levels simultaneously. In all cases page, bank, and cache line the best shape, in texels, for the specified memory unit is a square. In other words, ideally the set of texels stored within a single page would be a square; with 32-bit texels, the square would be 32 32 texels in size. Likewise, the set of 32-bit texels that contains only pages from different banks would be 64 64, and the set of 32-bit texels stored in a single cache line would be 4 4. If we could get that set of characteristics, we would, on average, get the best texel fetching speed possible. s take a look at how close image textures are to this ideal state. (Hint: not close otherwise we wouldn t need swizzling!) Image textures For a 32-bit-per-texel image (that is, unswizzled and not DXTC-compressed) texture, texels are addressed as follows: texaddr(u,v) = texbaseaddr + (v * pitch_in_bytes) + (u * texel_size_in_bytes) where texbaseaddr is the start address of the texture map in system memory, and texaddr is the memory address at which that texel resides. Thus, whenever the texture unit wants to fetch the texel at (u,v) from an image texture, it calculates the above equation, then reads from the resulting address. Note that an image texture doesn t need to have power-of-two dimensions, and can have a pitch (distance from the start of one row to the start of the next) that s different from its width. In fact, an image texture can have any width at all, and any pitch so long as it s 8 B or greater, although multiples of 16 B result in the best performance for image textures. Flexible sizing is one reason you might choose to use image textures rather than swizzled or DXTC. Another reason is that they re easy to render into. On the downside, they don t support cubemaps, mipmaps, 3-D texturing, or either wrap or mirror texture addressing mode. s a figure showing how the texels in an image texture, where the texture has a width of 8 texels and a pitch of 32 bytes, map to memory addresses (each square is a texel, and the number it contains is the memory address it s stored at; texels are assumed to be 32-bit in this example): The arrows show the order in which texels map to sequential memory addresses. It is readily apparent that locality is much better along u than along v, and that pages and cache lines will not be anywhere near square. In fact, if you extend this out to a 256 256 texture, each page will be 256 texels wide and 4 texels high, nearly as far from square as you can get. The mapping of image textures to the texture cache is less square still. For a 32-bit image texture that s 16 or more texels wide, each cache line in the texture cache will be 16 texels wide and exactly 1 texel high, which really is as far from square as it s possible to get. As discussed above, this means that image textures will provide considerably lower average texel-fetch performance than our hypothetical square mapping, and will also provide highly uneven performance, depending on the angle at which textures are scanned for texel data. Note that page coherence can potentially be improved by storing image textures in tiled memory. This concept is discussed further under DXTC textures, below. One interesting point is that image textures are very memory-friendly when they re rendered in an orientation where their layout is guaranteed to map well to the order in which texels are read, for example a 2-D HUD image that never rotates with respect to the screen. In such cases, image textures can actually run significantly faster than swizzled textures. Intuitively, you d think this would occur when u is horizontal on the screen and v is vertical, but in fact it occurs when v is horizontal and u is vertical when the texture is rotated 90 degrees due to the swath-based order in which pixels are rasterized. (The swath causes pixels to be rasterized in a somewhat convoluted S-shaped path to improve memory and texture cache performance.) The flip side is that an unrotated image texture is memory- and cache-unfriendly, and will run quite a bit more slowly than a swizzled texture. In short, image textures, while handy for stuff like one-shot rendered textures and non-power-of-two textures, can t support the level of performance we d like to see, because they aren t square at any of the levels we re looking for, and hence suffer from poor texture caching and memory-page coherence. Which brings us to swizzling. Swizzled textures Swizzling is really just a remapping of address bits within the texture unit so that textures can be accessed with better cache line and page coherency. Of course, in order for this to work, textures have to be stored in memory with data switched around to match the texture unit s remapping, or else the texture unit won t find texels where it expects them to be. When discussing swizzled textures, it s important to grasp the difference between the texel address remapping performed by swizzling and the memory mapping performed by tiling. As we saw above, tiling is one of two (along with linear) available mappings of bus-master-visible memory addresses to RAM chips, literally determining which storage location in which RAM chip is at address 0, which is at address 1, and so on. Texture swizzling, which specifies a non-linear memory layout for textures for the purpose of improving performance, appears similar but is in fact quite different, for it is not a memory mapping but rather a memory interpretation. To illustrate this by way of analogy, consider a program that stores matrix information in a one-dimensional array, retrieving it with the function: int Retrieve(int x, int y) { return y*matrix_width + x; } Now suppose that the author of the program realizes that sequential accesses to the matrix tend to be down the columns, and in order to get better caching changes how the data is stored so that Retrieve() now works like this: int Retrieve(int x, int y) { return x*matrix_height + y; } You certainly wouldn t say that the developer has changed the way the memory controller maps addresses to RAM chips addresses 0, 1, and so on are still in the same locations in the same chip so this is quite different from tiling, which does change the way the memory controller maps addresses. At the same time, you would say the developer has changed the addresses at which various elements of the matrix are stored in memory, and therefore has changed the physical locations at which his code sees the logical data it works with. So the underlying addressing of physical memory is unchanged, and, viewed from the perspective of the code that calls Retrieve(), both functionality and the data itself are unchanged as well; however, the layout of the data in physical memory, and hence the code s memory access patterns, have changed, with potentially major performance implications. Similarly, swizzling doesn t affect which storage locations/RAM chips bus masters find at various addresses; with or without swizzling, the address mapping is either linear or tiled, depending on whether the memory is viewed through a tiled memory region or not. Rather, swizzling is internal to the texture unit, and is a matter of changing the memory addresses at which the texture unit expects to find each texel, in order to improve texel fetching speed. In other words, swizzling is a property of the texture unit purely a matter of where the texture unit chooses to look for texels in memory.  Now, it s true that from the perspective of the texture unit, both tiling and swizzling effectively change where texels are stored. Still, it s worth making the distinction between memory mapping and memory interpretation for two reasons. First, the fact that swizzling happens in the texture unit, not the memory controller, means that swizzled textures look scrambled when viewed by the CPU, in contrast to tiled regions, which look the same to both the CPU and GPU. In particular, if you use the CPU to render an image for use as a texture map, you will either have to label it as an unswizzled (image) texture or else swizzle it before using it as a texture. Likewise, non-DXTC textures streamed into memory from DVD or hard disk should be preprocessed into swizzled format whenever possible; otherwise, they will have to either be swizzled at runtime or drawn as image textures, both of which are slower than directly loading preswizzled textures. Second, because swizzling happens in the texture unit and tiling happens in the memory controller, both can be in effect at the same time. This should actually never be allowed to be the case, for reasons that will soon become apparent, but it s important that you understand that it can happen so you can make sure that it doesn How swizzling works Improved texture-cache and page locality is the whole point of swizzling, the reason it s worth dealing with its complications. Image and swizzled textures are functionally the same; the only difference (apart from size and pitch restrictions on swizzled textures, as discussed below, and certain limitations on image textures such as their inability to support mipmaps, cubemaps, and wrap and mirror texture-wrap modes) is that swizzled texels can be retrieved by the texture unit much faster, on average, than image texels. Since texel fetching is a major factor in pixel-shader performance, swizzled textures usually run much faster than image textures. The superior performance of swizzled textures results directly from their memory layout, so let s examine that next. The remapping of address bits performed by the texture unit when accessing a swizzled 2n 2m 2-D texture is as follows: texaddr(u,v) = texbaseaddr + (vm-1vm-2 vnvn-1un-1vn-2un-2 v2u2v1u1v0u0) * texel_size_in_bytes  where the n-bit value u and the m-bit value v are the column and row numbers within the texture of the desired texel, with ux bit x of the column number and vy bit y of the row number. (This example assumes m>n, but generalizes directly to m<=n. Basically, the two texture coordinates alternate address bits, starting with their least significant bits, and when one runs out, the other keeps going until it runs out too.) Thus, whenever the texture unit wants to fetch the texel at (u,v) from a swizzled texture, it calculates the above equation, then reads from the resulting address. Remember that the actual RAM chip and storage location that corresponds to that address depends on whether linear or tiled addressing is in effect for that memory address. This is a good illustration of the orthogonality of swizzling and tiling; swizzling is one way the texture unit can calculate the address of a texel image textures and DXTC are the others while tiling is one way the memory controller can map addresses to physical RAM chips and storage locations, linear addressing being the other. s look at how sequential memory addresses actually step through a swizzled texture. Let s assume we re dealing with a 32-bit texture. Then: texel (0,0) is at address 0 texel (1,0) is at address 4 texel (0,1) is at address 8 texel (1,1) is at address 12 texel (2,0) is at address 16 and so on. That s pretty hard to visualize, so here s the layout of a swizzled texture in diagram form: It is readily apparent that ever-larger square areas of the texture reside in contiguous regions of memory. In fact, swizzled textures contain all the square texel areas that our hypothetical ideal mapping specified. Each 64-B cache line contains a 4 4 square of 32-bit texels; for 16-bit it would be an 8 4 block (as close to square as you can get with 32 texels); for 8-bit it would be 8 Similarly, each 4-KB page (consisting of one page from each partition, with the pages interleaved at a 16-B granularity) contains a 32 32 block of 32-bit texels. (Note that while any texture swizzled, texture, or DXTC may start at any 128-B alignment, a swizzled texture must start at the beginning of a page in order for each page to contain a full square.) At 16-bit, it 32; at 8-bit, it Finally, each 16-KB region containing exactly one page from each bank is 64 64 with 32-bit texels, 128 64 for 16-bit texels, and 128 128 for 8-bit texels. As a bonus, all mipmaps automatically get stored in ideal form as well. In short, swizzling makes for the fastest average texel access possible, at least in the absence of texel compression. You should use it in preference to image textures whenever you can. However, there are a few circumstances in which swizzling shouldn t or can t be used: Textures with non-power-of-two dimensions can t be swizzled. (The reason for this should be obvious from looking at how u and v bits interact to produce a memory address.) Swizzled textures must have equal pitch and width (that is, unlike image textures, there can t be padding between lines). The one exception is with border textures, as discussed below. As should now be clear, swizzled textures should never be stored in a tiled memory region. Swizzling s layout of texels in memory provides optimal page access for texturing; adding tiling s remapping of memory on top of that can only make things worse. Procedural textures constructed by software will tend to be image textures, since it is difficult for software to construct swizzled or DXTC textures directly. Of course, such textures can be converted to swizzled (either in software or using a hardware blt), but if such a texture is used only once before being discarded, the time required to perform the conversion may outweigh the benefits of swizzling. DXTC textures can t be swizzled, as discussed next. As a final note on swizzling, be aware that depth and pixel buffers can be swizzled, as well as textures. This can be useful when rendering to textures or to shadow maps. However, be aware that tiling is considerably more efficient than swizzling as a rendering target, and is generally preferred for render targets unless some other consideration (such as unavailability of a tiled memory region of the desired pitch, or the desire to avoid a swizzle blt) dictates otherwise. DXTC textures, palettized textures, and performance DXTC refers to the five compression formats for 2-D textures specified by DirectX. These formats provide roughly 4:1 compression, often (but by no means always) with little or no loss of visual quality. They save a great deal of both memory and memory bandwidth, and should be used in preference to both image and swizzled textures whenever possible. However, owing to the effects of such high compression, the precision of the decompressed texels is not high enough for all purposes (compressing normals doesn t work well, for example), and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The specifics of the DXTC formats will be described in another paper. For now, all we need to know is: DXT1 compresses 4 4 blocks of texels into 8 sequential bytes in memory, and by default the Xbox GPU decompresses them into dithered 16-bit textures (if the pixel buffer is 32-bpp) or non-dithered 16-bit textures (if the pixel buffer is 16-bpp). Non-dithered 16-bit textures may optionally be selected for the 32-bpp case as well, as described in the paper  Visual Quality and Performance Notes for Textures 5 compress 4 4 blocks of texels into 16 B (with translucency information accounting for the extra 8 B), and the Xbox GPU decompresses them into 32-bit textures. The 4 4 block containing a DXT1 texture is addressed as follows: texaddr_block(u,v) = texbaseaddr + (vm-1vm-2 v3v2un-1un-1un-2 u3u2) * block_size_in_bytes where block_size_in_bytes is 8 for DXT1 and 16 for DXT2 s the memory mapping of DXT2 5 for a 16 16 texture: Here each square outlined in solid black is the block of 4 4 texels stored in 16 contiguous bytes, and the number in each 4 4 square is the start address of the 16 B for that block. The 16 texels in each block are outlined by the dotted lines. Note the effect of the compression: this diagram uses the same amount of memory 256 B as do the previous image and swizzled texture diagrams, but describes four times as many texels. Also note that DXT1 would be exactly the same, except that the blocks would start every 8 B instead of every 16 B. Note that DXTC textures must have power-of-two dimensions. They mipmap all the way down to 2 2 and 1 1 textures; in these cases the texture map itself is still 4 4, but only the texels in the upper left corner of that 4 4 block are used. Except for the 2 2 and 1 1 cases, DXTC textures normally have the same pitch and width (that is, there can t be padding between lines); however, border textures behave differently, as discussed below. As you can see from the above figure, DXTC textures are not swizzled; this is due to hardware design limitations. Since we learned earlier why swizzled textures are superior to image textures, you might well wonder why the lack of DXTC swizzling isn t a major limitation. In truth, it is somewhat unfortunate that they re not swizzled; performance would be somewhat better if they were. However, it s not that big a deal for three reasons. First, DXTC textures are much smaller than normal textures, and their memory performance is inherently good because much less memory fetching is needed than with uncompressed textures. In fact, because DXT1 textures are so compressed, each page of a 256 256 DXT1 texture stored in normal linear memory is 256 32 texels in size not square, but not worse in v than the 32 32 pages of swizzled 32-bit textures and much better in u. DXT2 5 pages, at 256 16, are only half the height in v of swizzled 32-bit pages, but the 8X increase in width should much more than compensate for that in terms of overall performance. (Note, however, that the page asymmetry of DXTC textures means that performance will differ to some degree between zero-degree and ninety-degree texture orientations with respect to the screen.) Second, the 4 4-block nature of DXTC compression means that cache-line locality is optimal; each cache line stores an 8 4 block of a DXT1 texture (the texture is decompressed to 16-bit texels in the cache), or a 4 4 block of any other DXTC texture (decompressed to 32-bit texels). Still, as described above, locality at the page level is not as good with 256 256 DXTC textures as it might be, and it s worse for larger textures. (Note that DXT1 textures 128 128 or smaller and DXT2 5 textures smaller than 128 128 do in fact have optimal page locality, despite the absence of swizzling.) This brings us to the third reason that the inability to swizzle DXTC textures isn t as big a problem as it might seem to be, which is the potential of tiling to help improve page locality for large DXTC textures. For large, non-mipmapped DXTC textures, in fact, placing the textures in a tiled memory region with the same pitch as the texture (for example, 512 B two tiles wide for a 256 256 DXT1 texture) makes for excellent page locality, with pages storing blocks of texels as nearly square as possible. However, there are two hitches: There are only six tiled memory regions available after two are consumed by the pixel and depth buffers, so all tiled textures have to be packed into those six regions, each of which can only have a single pitch. Different mipmap levels benefit from different levels of tiling (ranging down to no tiling at all being optimal below certain sizes, as described above). Unfortunately, all mipmap levels have to be stored together, in contiguous memory. Therefore, the choice of whether to place a mipmapped texture into tiled memory at all, and if so, what tiling pitch to choose, is a compromise among the effects on the various mipmap levels, and there is no optimal solution. Thus, tiling is not as good for DXTC textures as swizzling would have been. (Note that 16 16 and smaller DXTC mipmaps fit in a single row of a single tile, so they work equally well with respect to paging regardless of whether they re tiled or not.) Consider, for example, the tiled versus linear tradeoffs for a mipmapped 256 256 DXT1 texture: Untiled 256 256 comes out to 256 32 texels per page, so it changes pages every 32 rows. All smaller mip levels come out optimal. Tiled 256 256 with 512-B pitch comes out to 128 64 texels per page, which is optimal. 128 128, 64 64, and 32 32 alternate pages frequently (every row, every 2 rows, and every 4 rows, respectively). All smaller mip levels come out optimal. In this case, it looks like untiled may be slightly better overall, but that s only a guess. Clearly, the tradeoffs will be different for DXT2 5 and for larger textures, as well. The important point is that there s really no way to be sure of the best tradeoff between tiling and linear for a particular DXTC texture format and size without timing its performance running on real hardware. By the way, there s no reason not to consider putting image textures in tiled memory as well. That s all the more true because the above-described mipmap issue doesn t apply to image textures, which don t support mipmaps. As usual, however, I d recommend running performance tests to determine whether your particular tiled image textures are actually faster. Regardless, DXTC textures, with or without tiling, perform better overall than non-compressed textures because of their much smaller bandwidth requirements. Not incidentally, they also have the advantage of a much smaller memory footprint. In general, they should be used whenever possible (that is, whenever their quality is high enough and they can be precompressed, or the time to compress them on the fly, for procedural textures, isn t too large). Note that DXTC textures decompress in a single clock, so there is no performance overhead associated with DXTC decompression. Palettized textures offer an alternative form of compression, providing lossless four-to-one compression for any case where 256 colors will suffice. Palettized textures are particularly useful when precise 32-bit texel values are needed, as, for example, with normal maps. One performance consideration with palettized textures is that the maximum palette look-up rate for expanding texels as they re loaded from memory into the texture cache is eight palettized texels looked-up per clock total across all palettized textures, which can slow texel fetching (and thus overall performance) when using multiple palettized textures. This is discussed in detail in the paper  Xbox Palettized Texture Performance.  One plus with palettized textures is that, unlike DXTC textures, they can be swizzled. There are, by the way, several YUV compressed image texture formats. However, like all image textures, these cannot be swizzled. Finally, note that texel formats that are compact relative to 32 bpp, such as 16 bit, require proportionally less bandwidth per texel than 32 bpp when loaded into the cache, and store proportionally more texels in each cache line and each page. Consequently, using compact texels has performance and footprint benefits, not unlike DXTC and palettized compression. In general, the tradeoff between size and quality tends to be significantly worse for compact texels than for DXTC or palette compression, but there are cases in which compact texels can be a big win; for example, storing lightmaps in 8-bit intensity textures works very well. And, of course, these textures can be swizzled, unlike DXTC. The bottom line is that you should use the smallest compressed or compact texture format possible. It ll free up memory, and your game will almost always run faster thanks to the reduction in memory bandwidth requirements (with one potential exception, as noted above, involving palettized textures). If it isn t possible to use DXTC, swizzle the texture if you can. s not to say that image textures aren t useful; they re considerably more versatile than the other formats, and will no doubt get used for many purposes. For example, because image textures have separately specifiable pitches, you can use a subrectangle of a texture as a texture in its own right. Image textures can also be packed together creatively, and image border textures waste less memory than other border textures. And certainly image textures are the preferred format for the CPU to manipulate directly, for example when rendering a texture in software. So feel free to use image textures as appropriate, but be aware that there s a performance cost to doing so.  Texture alignment and width Any texture, of any sort, can start at any 128-B alignment. (As a side note, each side of a cube map also must have 128-B alignment.) However, that is not sufficient alignment for optimal performance. The issues are different for swizzled textures and other textures; let s look at swizzled textures first. You might reasonably worry about making sure swizzled texels map optimally into the texture cache. That is, you want each texture cache line to contain a 4 4 block of swizzled 32-bit texels (or an 8 4 block of swizzled 16-bit texels, or an 8 8 block of swizzled 8-bit texels), the best mapping for cache efficiency, and to load as efficiently as possible. No need to worry, though given the default 128-B texture alignment and the way the texture cache works, swizzled texels will in fact always map optimally into cache lines without any additional effort on your part.  However, optimal mapping of swizzled textures to pages is not automatic, and is important. Ideally, each page would map to a 32 32 block of swizzled 32-bit texels (or 64 32 block at 16-bit, or 64 64 at 8-bit). For textures that are 4 KB or larger, however, this only happens if the texture starts at a page that is, 4 KB boundary; otherwise, pages will map to non-square sets of texels drawn from parts of two different texel blocks, and performance will suffer. For textures smaller than 4 KB, all that's required is that the texture not cross a page boundary; the easiest way to accomplish this, especially for multiple textures packed together, is to start each sub-4-KB texture at an alignment equal to its size. Thus, a 1-KB texture should start at an address that's a multiple of 1 K. For DXTC and image textures stored in linear memory, the issue of mapping square texel blocks to pages doesn't apply. It is still beneficial if textures cross as few page boundaries as possible, to minimize the number of pages that need to be opened. For textures that are power-of-two in size, this can be accomplished by observing the same restrictions as for swizzled textures: textures 4 KB or larger should start at 4-KB alignment, and textures smaller than 4 KB should start at an alignment equal to the texture size. Image textures that aren't a power-of-two in size need to be arranged in memory on a case-by-case basis, the only rules being that it s best to minimize the number of pages textures cross and to have a pitch that s a multiple of 16 B if possible. For DXTC and image textures stored in tiled rather than linear memory, there is an issue of mapping texel blocks to pages, since each 256-B 16 tile is a page. In this case textures should ideally be the same width as the tiled memory region, and textures that are a multiple of 16 in height should start at an offset, relative to the start of the tiled memory region, that's a multiple of the tiled memory region width times 16. In other words, such textures stored in tiled memory should start at the top of the leftmost tile in a tile row. Textures that are a power-of-two less than 16 in height should stay in a single tile row; this is most conveniently accomplished by starting at a tiled-memory-region offset that's a multiple of the tiled memory region width times the texture height. Textures that are not a power-of-two in height need to be packed into memory on a case-by-case basis to minimize the number of tile row boundaries crossed. Note that it is possible to do a 2-D packing of image textures into a tiled memory region that s wider than the textures. (DXTC textures cannot be packed in this way, because a DXTC texture s pitch is always equal to its width, with the exception of DXTC border textures, which still can t be horizontally packed, as discussed below.) If you choose to do this sort of 2-D packing of image textures, the rules are much the same as in the previous paragraph, but factoring in the 256-B tile width as well to cross as few tile boundaries as possible both horizontally and vertically. Finally, note that mipmap chains are packed contiguously into memory. That is, each mipmap level is stored appropriately for its size, starting with the largest level and followed by the other levels in decreasing order of size, with no padding in between. Consequently, the start of each mipmap chain the largest mipmap should be page-aligned properly for its largest mip level; this will cause the rest of the mip levels to automatically be placed so as to avoid page-alignment problems as well. 3-D textures Three-D textures can be either swizzled or stored in an extended DXTC format. The compressed format stores 3-D textures in cubes constructed as follows: up to four standard 4 4 DTXC blocks (depending on the depth of the texture; if the depth isn t an exact multiple of four, then the cubes at the back of the texture will each contain (depth % 4) 4 4 DXTC blocks; all other cubes will contain exactly four 4 4 DXTC blocks) are placed one behind the other (parallel), down the third axis, to form a 4 4 block compressed into 32 B or 64 B. Think of each 4 4 block as consisting of four slices stacked down the p axis, with each slice being a standard 4 4 2-D DXTC block. The following shows the memory layout of an 8 4 3-D texture: This format will be discussed in detail in another paper. The most important thing to keep in mind about 3-D textures is that because the memory footprint of 3-D textures goes up as a cube function, it is even more important than in the 2-D case to compress 3-D textures whenever possible. Interestingly, there is no 3-D image texture format; the only non-compressed 3-D texture format is swizzled. Three-D swizzling is a straightforward extension of 2-D swizzling, interleaving p, the third texture dimension, into the mix. Here s the remapping of address bits performed by the texture unit when accessing a swizzled 2n 2k 3-D texture: texaddr(u,v,p) = texbaseaddr + (pk-1pk-2 pmpm-1vm-1pm-2vm-2 pnvnpn-1vn-1un-1pn-2vn-2un-2 p2v2u2p1v1u1p0v0u0) * texel_size_in_bytes This example assumes k>m>n, but generalizes directly to all other cases. As in 2-D, the three texture coordinates alternate address bits, starting with their least significant bits, and when one runs out, the other one or two keep going until they run out too. A note about the texture cache As noted above in the discussion of palettized textures, textures are decompressed on their way into the cache, and stored in decompressed form. This should make it apparent that the texture cache is not a standard cache, because cache lines don t necessarily correspond directly to memory addresses. For example, no direct address mapping is possible between a 16-B 4 4 DXT2 block in memory and the 64 B it decompresses into in the texture cache. In fact, the texture cache is a highly intelligent cache that does a lot of work under the covers to make texture access as efficient as possible. For example, it knows when mipmapping is in effect, and works to keep both active mip levels cached simultaneously. It also works in conjunction with the swath width setting and the rasterizer to keep data cached even when large triangles (in screen space) with large textures are being drawn there is no triangle or texture size that will automatically cause the texture cache to thrash. I m not going to go into further detail about the texture cache, because (1) its detailed operations are confidential, and (2) NVIDIA states that it wouldn t help you if you knew; the texture cache is designed to do the right thing in almost all circumstances, and there s little opportunity at best to improve it from the coding or data side. (I know, #2 probably isn t as true as the cache s designers would like, but #1 is the main reason I m not going to discuss cache internals further. That and the fact that I don t know how they work myself.) In any case, we will provide a tool that will let you determine exactly how fast any pixel shader with any textures will run, and you can use that to evaluate the performance of the texture cache for yourself. The one important texture cache tip to keep in mind is that the texture cache is carefully designed to avoid thrashing in normal operation, where  normal  is defined as  when textures are properly mipmapped.  Minification of textures (that is, using no mipmaps and sampling the texture map at far-apart locations) will cause performance to drop, sometimes drastically. Generally, minification can and should be avoided; the only case in which minification is unavoidable is when doing a function lookup via a texture map, because there's no reasonable way to mipmap that. Border textures Any of the types of textures image, swizzled, or DXTC may optionally be a border texture. Making a texture a border texture specifies that its upper left corner has a coordinate of ( 4), rather than the usual (0,0). (Just drop or add an axis for 1-D or 3-D textures.) The purpose of this is to provide a 4-texel-wide support area for filters near the edge of the texture, thereby eliminating certain rendering artifacts such as seams between textures; see the paper  Texture Addressing Modes  for further details on border textures and texture filtering. The dimensions of the texture bitmap itself must be enlarged in order to accommodate the four extra texels around the normal texture region, and the pitch of the texture must change as well. For image textures, this is accomplished by reserving a larger bitmap for the texture, and by specifying a correspondingly larger pitch. Thus, making an N M image texture a border texture would involve adding a minimum of M*8+N*8+4*4*4 texels to the bitmap, and increasing the pitch by eight texels. Swizzled and DXTC border textures are less flexible and can be considerably more expensive than image border textures. These textures have to have power-of-two dimensions; consequently, the addition of four border texels at each edge means that each texture dimension increases to the smallest power of two larger than or equal to the width of the normal texture plus eight. This generally causes each dimension to double from what it would have been for an equivalent non-border texture, although for small textures the increase can be larger. Thus, the price for making a swizzled or DXTC texture a border texture is an increase in size of at least four times (eight times for 3-D textures). One interesting fine point is that the unused space within swizzled and DXTC border textures can potentially be reused; image textures can be stored in those unused areas. In fact, DXTC and swizzled textures can also be stored in the unused border areas in some cases, but because non-image textures can t have differing width and pitch, they can only be stored in the unused area at the bottom of a border texture, not in the unused area at the right side. There is a quirk you should be aware of when border textures are used with DXTC textures that have widths or heights of 1 or 2. In all other cases, DXTC borders fit neatly into their own 4 4 compressed block, so border texels are always compressed in separate blocks from the texels of the normal texture, and each compressed block contains either 16 normal texels or 16 border texels. However, 1 1 DXTC border textures are stored as follows: Here,   is a border texel,   is the one normal texture texel, and unlabeled squares are  t-care  because they re not used. Each 4 4 block outlined with heavier lines is a 4 4 DXTC-compressed block; as you can see, the middle block contains a mix of normal texels and border texels, and the bottom and right blocks contain a mix of border texels and don t-care texels. Similarly, 2 2 DXTC border textures are stored as follows: The lack of padding around 1- and 2-wide DXTC border textures applies on a per-texture-axis basis, so a 4 1 DXTC border texture would have normal and border texels mixed within a 4 4 block along only one axis. The same principle extends in a straightforward way to 1-D and 3-D textures. For non-border textures, the maximum texture dimension along any axis is 4 K for 1-D and 2-D textures, and 512 for 3-D textures. Addressing the border takes one bit, however, so the maximum dimension for any axis of a border textures is 2 K for 1-D and 2-D textures, and 256 for 3-D textures. The CPU and memory CPU performance is often determined as much by the performance of the memory subsystem in response to CPU requests as by CPU processing speed. The custom-designed CPU on the Xbox is a standard PIII/733, except that it has only a 128-KB cache; thus, the excellent PIII information available on  HYPERLINK "http://www.intel.com/" http://www.intel.com/  is applicable. (For example, the Intel Architecture Optimization Reference Manual, available from   HYPERLINK "http://www.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/manuals"  http://www.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/manuals , is very useful). I ll give a brief overview of the custom-designed CPU s memory-related characteristics here, but suggest that you refer to Intel s publications for details. CPU caching  The Xbox GPU has two levels of cache L1 and L2 and an out-of-order interface to the Xbox memory controller for memory requests. The out-of-order interface allows the CPU to have multiple instructions simultaneously in various partial states of completion and hence multiple memory requests outstanding at one time, and also allows it to handle completion of those requests in any order, not just the order in which they were issued. This lessens the impact of memory latency on CPU performance, without requiring cooperation from the code that s being executed. Refer to Intel s documentation for details, along with recommendations about how code can be written for improved performance with respect to both CPU processing and memory access efficiency.  The first level of CPU caching is the L1 cache. The L1 cache is very tightly coupled to the CPU, and responds very quickly to memory requests; for example, a MOV to memory from a memory address that s cached in the L1 cache takes only one cycle. (The instruction cycle times listed in Intel s documentation assume L1 cache hits on all memory accesses.) The L1 cache is actually two caches, a 16-KB code cache and a 16KB data cache. Despite the split caches, self-modifying code will work; however, there may be a substantial slowdown if the code is executed immediately after being modified. Both L1 caches are four-way set associative, with 32-B cache lines. The L1 data cache is write-back, meaning that when data is written to a cacheable memory location that s currently in the cache, it will not necessarily be written to memory immediately, but will rather be held in the L1 cache until the L1 cache chooses to write out the entire cache line containing that data. The L1 cache is write-allocating. This means that when a write is made to a cacheable memory location that is not currently cached, the entire cache line containing that memory location is first read into the cache before the write proceeds. At that point, since the data is in the L1 cache, it is handled using the write-back cache policy described in the preceding paragraph. The second level of CPU caching is the L2 cache. The L2 cache is not as tightly coupled as the L1 cache, but, unlike many L2 caches, the L2 cache on the Xbox is on the same chip die as the CPU and runs at the CPU s full clock speed, so it responds very quickly. When a read request misses the L1 cache and hits the L2 cache, it takes only four clocks (at 733 MHz) to load the cache line containing the missed data into the L1 cache and provide the data to the CPU. The L2 cache is a 128-KB unified cache both code and data are stored in it and is eight-way set associative, with 32-B cache lines. Like the L1 cache, it is a write-back, write-allocating cache. If a memory access misses both caches, a request for the cache line containing the required data it is sent to the Xbox memory controller. CPU cache line memory requests (and, in fact, all CPU memory requests, cached or otherwise) are always 32-B aligned and 32 B in size, and therefore span two partitions. Thus the minimum time required to fill a CPU cache line is 10 ns (2 MCLKs using two partitions at once); this is equivalent to more than seven CPU cycles. Memory access times can, however, be much longer, given page misses and contention with other bus masters. (The memory controller gives the highest priority to CPU requests, since latency is more of a problem for the CPU than for other bus masters, but the memory controller may still have to wait for an in-progress memory access to finish before it can fulfill a CPU request.) So, for example, a 12-MCLK page miss would result in a latency of about 44 CPU cycles. On the other hand, some or all of this latency can often be hidden by the CPU s out-of-order processing. Note that the PIII has cache-control instructions, such as a prefetch instruction designed to prime the caches so that data will already be loaded when it is needed at some later point. For additional details on this and other aspects of CPU caching and memory access, please refer to the documentation on Intel s Web site.  Unlike most RISC chips, the PIII is capable of performing unaligned memory accesses that is, memory accesses with address alignment less than the size of the access, such as reading a DWORD (4-byte value) starting at address 1. However, for best performance all memory accesses made by the CPU should be aligned to match their size. Thus, byte accesses only need to be byte-aligned, but DWORD accesses should be DWORD-aligned. Unaligned accesses will work, but will be considerably slower than aligned accesses. The slowness of unaligned accesses is primarily a result not of extra memory accesses (since the custom-designed CPU always does 32-B reads into the cache), but of extra work the CPU has to do to assemble and align the data, so aligned accesses are preferable even if the data is cached. (However, out-of-order processing can hide some of this overhead, so there can be situations in which unaligned accesses are potentially useful; avoid them whenever there s a reasonable alternative, but don t write them off completely.) Since CPU cache-line reads and writes from and to memory are always 32 B in size and 32-B aligned, CPU accesses should cross as few 32-B boundaries as possible. For example, if you have an array of 32-B structures that you are going to read in random order, you should 32-B align the start of the array, so only one cache line needs to be read each time you access a structure that s not already cached. This not only minimizes memory accesses, but also makes the most efficient use of limited cache space. The benefits of crossing as few 32-B boundaries as possible aren t limited to cached memory. Access to non-cached memory is performed using the same aligned 32-B blocks as cache line reads and writes. However, we need to lay a little groundwork before we can discuss efficient writes to non-cached memory further. Non-cached memory The custom-designed CPU treats some areas of memory as cached, and other as non-cached. Non-cached memory is used for two purposes: control of memory-mapped registers, and tasks that involve lots of writing and little or no reading, such as a constructing a push-buffer that controls the GPU, or procedurally generating textures. Any data that s read or written by both the CPU and another bus master must be in non-cached memory, for reasons I ll discuss next. s pretty obvious why we wouldn t want to cache memory-mapped registers d want to read the latest results, not cached results, and write-back and write-allocation wouldn t work properly but why not cache areas that are exclusively or mostly written to? There are two reasons, functions of the custom-designed CPU s write-allocate and write-back caching policies, respectively. (As you ll recall, write-allocation causes written-to memory locations that aren t currently in the cache to be read into the cache before the write occurs, and write-back defers writing cached data back to memory for efficiency.) The first reason is that caching areas of memory that are never or rarely read from is very bad for performance, due to write-allocation. It would take time to load cache lines with such data, and that data would take up valuable cache space for no good purpose (there s no point to caching data you ll never read), pushing out other data that it is useful to cache because it will likely be read again later. The second reason for not caching mostly- or only-written-to memory locations is that the write-back policy makes it very difficult to synchronize cached CPU memory with another bus master. For example, if the push-buffer were in cacheable memory, then the GPU command stream might not actually be written to memory for milliseconds long after the GPU needs to read them. Short of invalidating the entire cache, which is very expensive, there s no way to be sure when cached data has been written to memory on a PIII. Consequently, it is mandatory that all data read or written by the GPU be stored in non-cacheable memory; otherwise, you will probably not get correct results. (The hardware and operating system take care of these issues for other bus masters, such as the IDE and Ethernet controllers.) Non-cached memory solves both of the above problems, but of course at the price of losing the benefits of caching. For memory that will only ever be written to, like the push-buffer, that s no problem (due to write-combining memory, as discussed below), but you should try to avoid putting data that you will have to read as well as write in non-cached memory, if at all possible. If you read from non-cached memory, you will find that each memory read takes the full latency of reading from the RAM chips; you ll get none of the benefit of fast access for repeated accesses to the same cache line that the caches give you. If you do have to deal with reading non-cached memory (for example, you may have to copy a texture rendered to by the GPU into cacheable memory so you can do post-processing at a reasonable speed), your best bet is generally to copy the data from the write-combined buffer into a cacheable buffer, have the CPU process it there, then copy it back to the write-combined buffer. The CPU has to be used to do the copying, to ensure cache coherence (in particular, you can t use the GPU s bltter). For the CPU copy from non-cached to cached, it s best to use SSE instructions to copy the data 16 B at a time, thus at least getting as much of the maximum read bandwidth as possible (much better than the one-eighth you d get if you copied a DWORD at a time, although in truth SSE breaks each 16-B transaction into two 8-B transactions, so you could use 8-B MMX instructions instead to equally good effect). There are two types of non-cached memory: write-combining and uncached. Writes to uncached memory are individually and promptly transacted to the bus. Writes to write-combining memory that are within a single 32-B-aligned 32-B chunk of memory, on the other hand, are queued up until the entire 32-B chunk has been written or writing has moved on to other parts of memory, and then the whole chunk (or the parts that have been changed, if it s only partially modified) is written at once to memory. This is considerably more efficient than equivalent uncached writes in fact, it s the most efficient way for the custom-designed CPU to write to memory, even faster than cached writes, since no initial read is required. Thus, as a general rule all Xbox non-cached memory, such as the push-buffer, should be write-combining. (Some memory-mapped control registers appear in an uncached memory space, but these don t involve physical memory.) The layout and control of Xbox cached, write-combining, and uncached memory will be discussed in a separate paper. When you write to write-combining memory, be sure to do all the writing required for one aligned 32-B chunk before moving on to the next. For example, don t write a byte at offset 0 in a write-combining buffer, then write to offset 32, then at 64, 96, 128, and so on, only later coming back to write to offset 1; this will result in many extra writes going out to the memory controller. Instead, write all the bytes you want to change in the first 32 bytes, then the next 32 bytes, and so on. The easiest way to do this, of course, is to always write data sequentially to write-combining memory. Also, cached reads can cause write-combining write buffers to be flushed. Consequently, for maximum performance when copying, it s best to read a chunk of data into an L1 cache buffer, then write from there, so the write-combining can proceed without interference. Note that the above discussion of write-combining is simplified. In particular, the custom-designed CPU actually supports write combining for several 32-B chunks at once. Refer to Intel s documents for further information on write-combining memory, and cached, write-combining, and non-cached memory in general. A note on overlapping memory types It might seem that it would be useful to map a specific part of memory in multiple ways in particular, as both cached and write-combining at the same time, and maybe as write-through cached as well, in order to help with the cache coherency problem. Unfortunately, this is not supported by the hardware. Or, rather, it is supported by the hardware in the sense that it s possible to overlap the above mappings, but it s not supported in the sense that Intel doesn t test that functionality or guarantee that it works correctly except in the case of uncached memory, which can overlap with any one other type which means that it s likely to fail in rare and obscure cases and give you nasty non-reproducible bugs. So, tempting as it might seem to map memory in multiple ways for various purposes, we recommend that you not do it. Virtual-addressing pages The term   can refer to a column-addressable sequence of storage locations in a RAM chip, as discussed earlier. It can also refer to a block of memory that is virtually addressable by the CPU as a unit. In other words, all bytes within that block are addressed by their offset plus the virtual-memory address of the start of the block. In PC systems, such pages can be loaded from and swapped to hard disk, but the Xbox System Software uses pages only for virtual-memory addressing; they are not backed by the hard disk. The custom-designed CPU supports not one but two sizes of pages of the latter sort: 4 KB and 4 MB. Four-KB pages are the more flexible of the two, and therefore are more generally useful. However, every page incurs an overhead cost in memory (used to tell the CPU how to map memory); further, there is a performance cost every time a new page has to be pointed to by the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), a cache the CPU uses to map virtual addresses to pages each time memory is accessed. Four-MB pages, also known as large pages, although less flexible, reduce these costs greatly (simply because so many fewer pages are needed), so they are used in special cases where large buffers are allocated and left as-is thereafter, such as the pixel- and depth-buffers. Further information about Xbox virtual-memory pages will be discussed in a separate paper. Again, the best source of further information about the custom-designed CPU is Intel s Web site.

The 8888 value is then used as the texel value for texture mapping. The 4:1 compression that palettized textures thereby achieve has significant benefits in terms of both memory footprint and memory bandwidth. DXT-compressed textures can also be compressed 4:1, but with different strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, DXTC isn t limited to 256 colors; on the downside, unlike palettized textures, DXTC can t have an independent, precise value for every texel. (Only four values can be used in each 4   4 block of DXTC texels, and the four values aren t independent of one another.) So, for example, if you need thousands of colors in a texture, DXTC is a better choice, but if you want to store a compressed normal map, and 256 distinct normals will suffice, a palettized texture will work much better, because it will allow perfect decompression of the normals. Thus, palettized textures can be quite useful in the proper context. However, there is one performance implication associated with palettized textures that you should be aware of: palettized textures can result in slower loading of the texture cache, which in turn can reduce performance. To understand why, we need to look at how texturing works. The texture cache The texture cache is an 8-KB cache that stores recently used texels in 64-B cache lines, organized as four 16-B sectors per line. Up to 32 B can be read by the texture cache from memory on each clock; this can be done either in the form of 32 B read from a single texture, or 16 B read from each of two textures simultaneously. Up to 64 B can be stored into the texture cache on each clock; since only 32 B can be read, obviously a 64-B store can only happen due to decompression. (In particular, 64-B stores can only happen as the result of decompression of DXT-compressed textures, which compress 4:1 and decompress 16 8888 texels or 32 1555 texels in a single clock; as we ll see, palettized textures, although they also compress at 4:1, can only decompress 8 texels/clock, so they can t store more than 32 B into the texture cache on a single clock.) From now on, I ll call the rate at which bytes can be stored into the texture cache the texture cache fill rate. There are 32 taps into the texture cache for the texture units to use to sample data. Since there are four rasterization pipelines, this means that there are 8 taps per pipeline; in other words, each pipeline can read up to eight texels per clock. Next, let s look at some common ways that data can be read from the texture cache: 2-D bilinear filtering, 2-D trilinear filtering, and 3-D trilinear and quadlinear filtering. Bilinear filtering With 2-D bilinear filtering, four adjacent samples are read for each pixel. If mipmapping isn t used, samples from different pixels can be widely scattered when textures are minified, and that can cause a significant slowdown (both from hardware implementation restrictions and from reading data into the texture cache that is not used), so mipmapping should always be used whenever minification is possible. To simplify the analysis of performance, this paper will assume that mipmapping is used. ll repeat it again, because it s a very important rule to follow, not only for palettized textures but for all textures: use mipmapping for any texture that could otherwise be minified. This paper will further assume that textures are swizzled for maximum cache coherency, and that is likewise a practice you should follow whenever possible for non-DXT-compressed textures, except in the rare cases where image textures line up efficiently with the texel-scanning pattern (which basically happens only when textures are parallel to the viewplane and rotated 90 degrees around the z axis in viewspace). Mipmapping causes between 0.5 and 2 texels to be loaded into the texture cache per pixel (keep in mind that samples are usually shared between adjacent pixels), resulting in an average of about 4 texels/texture (across the four pixel pipelines) loaded into the cache per clock, and a maximum of 8 texels/texture/clock. Up to two 2-D textures can be processed in a single clock, so the overall average for two 2-D textures is 8 texels loaded into the texture cache per clock, and the maximum is 16 texels/clock. We ll examine the implications of these numbers shortly. Please be aware that these numbers are ideal values and do not take into account various other factors; we will fudge them later to compensate for the fact that caches are not ideal in practice. Also note that the numbers can be considerably lower for highly magnified textures, or for textures that fit in the cache and are reused multiple times, and can be higher for minified textures. Note that using point sampling doesn t reduce the number of texels fetched from the texture cache. When point sampling is enabled, the same texels are fetched as would be fetched for bilinear filtering, then all but one of the samples are discarded. Trilinear filtering With 2-D trilinear filtering, eight samples are read for each pixel, four from the lower miplevel and four from the higher miplevel. To be precise, between 0.25 and 1 texel is read from the lower miplevel, and between 1 and 4 texels are read from the higher miplevel. This results in an average of about 10 texels/clock loaded into the texture cache across the four pipelines, and a maximum of 20 texels/clock. Only one trilinear texture can be processed in a single clock, since one trilinear texture essentially takes up the same resources as two bilinear textures. 3-D trilinear and quadlinear filtering For 3-D textures, the equivalent of 2-D bilinear filtering is 3-D trilinear filtering. This is different from 2-D trilinear filtering, involving eight samples (the corners of a cube) in a single 3-D texture. As such, eight samples are read for each pixel. Again, mipmapping should always be used when minification is a possibility. With mipmapped 3-D trilinear textures, between 0.35 and 2.83 texels are loaded into the texture cache per pixel. This results in an average of about 4 texels/4 pixels (again, across the four pipelines), and a maximum of 11.3 texels/4 pixels. Each trilinear texture takes two clocks. Thus, the texel requirements listed above are cut in half on a per-clock basis. The 3-D analogue of 2-D trilinear filtering is 3-D quadlinear, which filters together two 3-D trilinear miplevels. Like 3-D trilinear, each 3-D quadlinear texture requires two clocks to run. Over those two clocks, between 0.125 and 1 texel is read from the lower miplevel, and between 1 and 8 texels are read from the higher miplevel. This results in an average of about 6.4 texels/clock across the four pipelines, and a maximum of 18 texels/clock. The palette RAMs As mentioned above, palettized texels are decompressed (looked up) as they re loaded into the texture cache. The graphics chip contains eight internal palette RAMs, each of which can store an entire 256-entry palette. Each palette RAM can perform the lookup for a single texel in one clock, and the palette RAMs can operate in parallel, so up to eight palettized texels can be looked up in one clock. Apart from the bandwidth required to copy a palette from memory into the palette RAMs when the palette is initially accessed (a relatively small cost all eight palette RAMs together are only 8 KB, compared to 256 KB for a single use of a 256   256 8888 texture although you wouldn t want to switch to a new palettized texture every triangle), no extra memory bandwidth is required to look up palettized texels, so palettized textures really do result in a bandwidth reduction of very nearly 4:1. The on-demand copying of a palette into the palette RAMs does take time 128 clocks to copy a full 256-entry palette and the time is proportional to the number of entries copied. (Note that this time is the same no matter whether one or all eight palette RAMs are being loaded; replication to multiple palette RAMs while copying is free.) Valid palette sizes are 32, 64, 128, and 256. Apart from palette loading, it makes no difference how many palette entries are used. In particular, it is not possible to have, for example, sixteen 128-entry palettes rather than eight 256-entry palettes. Only eight palettes can ever be active, and any excess portion of a palette RAM is simply unused.  Performance with a single palettized texture Given the above information, we can see how likely we are to run into a texture cache fill bottleneck with a single palettized texture. Note that a fudge factor of 1.25 has been applied to the number of texels required, to account for edge, rotational, and other effects. 2-D bilinear 2-D trilinear 3-D trilinear 3-D quadlinear Avg texels needed/clock Max texels needed/clock Max texels available/clock Avg texels available/needed Max texels available/needed (Note that because each 3-D trilinear or quadlinear texture takes 2 clocks, the per-clock bandwidth required is cut in half relative to the total number of texels required by a 3-D trilinear or quadlinear texture.) As you can see, 2-D palettized textures with bilinear filtering will slow down at least a little (there will probably be at least some slowdown associated with texels minified to almost the miplevel transition). Similarly, 3-D quadlinear textures will slow down for about half the possible levels of detail (LODs). A single 3-D trilinear texture shouldn t slow down at all, mainly because the two-clock speed of a single 3-D trilinear texture spreads out the bandwidth demands. However, there will likely be a substantial shortfall in texture cache fill rate, and hence performance, for 2-D trilinear palettized textures. Note that equivalent shortfalls would exist for uncompressed 8888 textures, since only 32 B eight 8888 texels can be read by the cache in a single clock. And, in fact, if two textures are being loaded into the cache at once, 8888 can load only four texels while eight palettized texels can be loaded and still leave a 16-B load free for the other texture. Thus, palettized textures compare well to 8888 textures, providing the same texture cache fill rate at the cost of only about one-quarter the bandwidth and memory footprint. However, DXT2-5 texels could be loaded at twice the rate of palettized texels, and DXT1 texels can be loaded four times as fast. That doesn t mean that palettized textures aren t worth using. If you need 8888 texels and can get by with 256 colors, the bandwidth savings of palettized textures makes them clearly superior to uncompressed 8888, and even in comparison with 16-bit textures, palettized textures have only half the maximum cache fill rate, but also require only half the bandwidth and memory footprint. Also, if you have an expensive vertex shader and small triangles, or if you have an expensive register combiner program, the extra clocks required to store palettized texels into the cache may be partly or completely hidden. And, as mentioned above, the maximum rate of eight palettized texels takes up only one of the texture cache s two 16-B memory read buses, so additional texels can be read for another texture at the same time palettized texels are being read. That raises an interesting question: what happens if two palettized textures are used at once? The answer is more complicated than you might think. Using multiple textures that share the same palette First, let s consider the simpler case, where two or more textures share the same palette. (  means  at the same address ; thus, two textures will share a single palette if each specifies the same memory location for its palette.) Even with multiple palettized textures, there are still only eight palette RAMs, so the maximum decompression rate is still 8 palettized texels/clock, total. Thus, if two palettized textures are accessed on the same clock, palette lookup performance will be considerably lower than for the single-palettized-texture case and will tend to be a bottleneck, as follows. (Again, as above, the following table applies a factor of 1.25 to account for edge and rotational effects. This will be the case in all subsequent tables as well.) Note that the following table reflects total texel demand for both textures. Paired 2-D bilinear textures Avg texels needed/clock Max texels needed/clock Max texels available/clock Avg texels available/needed Max texels available/needed Note that paired 2-D bilinear textures overlap that is, they execute simultaneously, on the same clock so they run in 1 clock total for the pair, assuming there s no texel-fetch delay. (This is also true of cubemaps, or of a cubemap paired with a 2-D texture.) The texels/clock figures reflect this. The 2-D trilinear and 3-D trilinear and quadlinear cases aren t listed because they don t allow two textures to overlap that is, two textures of those types can t execute on the same clock so two of any of those have exactly the same per-clock texel fetching performance as one, and take twice as long overall. Thus, if two 2-D trilinear palettized textures are used, each one will effectively take a full clock, so each of them will be able to look up eight texels per clock, and the results for each will be as described in the earlier table; likewise for two 3-D trilinear and quadlinear textures, except that in that case each texture will take 2 clocks. In the above table, we re only concerned with the case in which two palettized textures are referenced on the same clock, because that s the situation that causes contention for the limited lookup resources of the eight palette RAMs. If two textures share a palette, they are not guaranteed to be referenced on the same clock. Understanding why that is the case requires a short digression regarding the concept of pairing. The hardware can process up to four textures per pixel per pipeline. If there are two or more textures, the first two textures processed pair with each other and are processed during the same clock if they are capable of overlapping with each other (as 2-D bilinear textures are, for example). Then, if there are two remaining textures, they pair with each other, and likewise overlap if possible. However, there are two exceptions: the textures in stages 0 and 2 cannot pair, and the textures in stages 1 and 3 cannot pair. Note that pairing by itself doesn t have any performance effect. However, it is only when textures are paired that they have the opportunity to run simultaneously if they re capable of overlapping, which in turn can improve performance by reducing the number of clocks the pixel shader requires to process pixels. What determines the order in which textures are processed, and hence paired? Simply the numeric order of their texture stages. The lowest-numbered enabled texture stage is first, the next lowest is second, and so on. Here are all the possible combinations of multiple enabled texture stages, and the pairing that results. Enabled texture stages Pairing 0,1,2 0,1,2,3 0+1, 2+3 0,2,3 0,1,3 1,2,3 Textures that are paired run simultaneously if they re overlappable; otherwise, the first member of the pair runs, followed by the second memory. Any textures that aren t paired run by themselves. Thus, assuming that 2-D bilinear textures, which are overlappable, are selected for all active texture stages, then in the 0,1 case, textures 0 and 1 pair and overlap, taking as little as 1 clock total (depending on whether texels are fetched quickly enough to avoid stalling); in the 1,2,3 case, 1 and 2 pair and overlap, followed by 3, taking a minimum of 2 clocks; and in the 0,2 case, texture 0 runs, and then texture 2, taking a minimum of 2 clocks, with no pairing or overlap. In the four-texture case, 0 and 1 pair and overlap on one clock, and then 2 and 3 pair and overlap as soon as 0 and 1 are finished, so the four textures take a minimum of 2 clocks total. Obviously, it is desirable to get as much overlapping as possible, in order to minimize the number of clocks the pixel shader takes, which means pairing overlappable textures whenever possible. For example, if you have two 2-D bilinear textures and one 3-D trilinear texture, they will run in 4 clocks if they are arranged like this: Stage 0: 3-D trilinear Stage 1: 2-D bilinear #1 Stage 2: 2-D bilinear #2 The reason for the 4-clock performance is that 0 and 1 pair but can t overlap, so together they take the sum of their 2- and 1-clock execution times, and then 2 runs by itself in 1 clock. In contrast, this: Stage 0: 2D bilinear #1 Stage 1: 2D bilinear #2 Stage 2: 3D trilinear #1 runs in 3 clocks, with the 2-D textures pairing and running overlapped in a single clock, and the 3-D texture then running by itself in 2 clocks. (Note that while the above description is accurate, the overall overlapping rules are actually more complex than this makes them appear for example, a 2-D bilinear can pair with a following 3-D trilinear, but not with a preceding 3-D trilinear and will be discussed in detail in another paper.) You might think the point of all this is to tell you that if you pair palettized textures that share a palette, they ll contend for the palette RAM and that will slow things down. Actually, however, that s not the case. In terms of how the graphics hardware works internally, cache misses aren t neatly synchronized with when texture units run; there s a lot of internal pipelining and queuing, so it s quite possible for palettized textures in stages 0 and 3 to miss the texture cache at the same time. Certainly if you have only two textures, both 2-D bilinear, and they share the same palette, they are going to contend a great deal, but as you add additional non-palettized textures and/or slower texture ops, it becomes difficult to estimate how much contention will occur, regardless of what textures are in what stages. Thus, feel free to use palettized textures that share the same palette in any texture stages, but be aware that you will likely experience some degree of slowdown, because they are likely to contend for the palette RAMs to at least some degree, and possibly a great deal. At times when they don t contend, each will run just as fast as if it had the palette RAMs to itself (which it effectively does), but when they do contend, they ll run as described by the table above. Palette RAM allocation The really messy and slow case is when there are multiple palettized textures that have different palettes. To understand this, we ll have to look at how the palette RAMs are managed. (I should point out, in case it s not clear from the above paragraph, that the standard restriction in Microsoft  DirectX  8 that all palettized textures must share the same palette doesn t apply on Xbox. You could, if you want, have four palettized textures, each with a different palette although I don t recommend it for performance reasons, as discussed next.)  The eight palette RAMs are effectively a cache that stores whatever palettes are currently active. (With reference to a palette,  active  means  a texture that uses that palette currently being read by a texture unit. ) Whenever a palettized texture is referenced by a texture unit and the associated palette is not in the palette RAMs, the palette is automatically loaded into the texture cache, where it remains until the time when no texture associated with that palette is selected. The interesting question is what happens if two or more palettized textures are active, and each of those palettized textures has a different palette. The answer is that the palette RAMs get allocated between the various palettes, as follows: # palettes palette RAMs allocated to each texture 4:2:2 2:2:2:2 (Note that in the case of three palettes, it s the palettized texture that s selected into the lowest-numbered texture stage that is allocated four palette RAMs.) So, for example, if there are two palettized textures, with different palettes, each has only four palette RAMs available for looking up its texels as it s stored into the texture cache. Palettized texture performance with different palettes Obviously, allocating the palette RAMs among multiple palettes will have a considerable impact on performance, since it cuts per-texture lookup performance to 50 percent or even 25 percent of maximum. The performance of each palettized texture when there are two palettized textures with different palettes is as follows. 2-D bilinear 2-D trilinear 3-D trilinear 3-D quadlinear Avg texels needed/clock Max texels needed/clock Max texels available/clock Avg texels available/needed Max texels available/needed (Again, a single 3-D trilinear texture takes 2 clocks; the 3-D trilinear per-clock numbers reflect this.) Clearly, from a performance perspective it s worth thinking twice before using multiple palettized textures with different palettes, because they will always be at least somewhat texel fill-constrained, substantially so for everything but 3-D trilinear. Note that unlike the shared texture case above, the performance of each texture is the same regardless of whether or not the palettized textures end up fetching texels on the same clock, because textures with different palettes each have their own set of palette RAMs, rather than competing for shared ones. Summary Using palettized textures is the only way on Xbox to get 4:1 compression together with fully independent 8888 values for each texel (although this does require you to limit yourself to no more than 256 total colors per texture), thereby saving both memory bandwidth and memory footprint. However, Xbox has limited resources for decompressing palettized textures, and this limited lookup rate can have an impact ranging from no effect at all (for a single non-minified 2-D bilinear filtered texture) to many clocks per pixel. How big the slowdown will be is highly context-dependent. For example, if you have a 50-clock vertex shader, and your triangles average only 3 pixels in size, you re unlikely to see any slowdown. Similarly, if you pair a palettized texture with a slow texture address op, the extra lookup clocks may overlap completely. On the other hand, if you have a fast vertex shader and large triangles, and you re using two trilinear palettized textures with different palettes, you re likely to slow down a lot. The only way to know for sure how it ll affect your code is to time it and see. Bear in mind that the bandwidth savings of palettized textures frequently more than balance any lost clocks, if the alternative is to use uncompressed textures. All in all, you should consider palettized textures a useful part of your Xbox toolkit. DXTC textures should generally provide higher performance than palettized textures, with the same 4:1 compression, and should be used whenever possible, but for cases where DXTC textures aren t appropriate, palettized textures are well worth considering.

They work as you would expect them to. There are four digital buttons on the Xbox Controller: START, BACK, and the left and right thumbstick, all of which can be depressed. The state of these buttons is stored in the wButtons field of the XINPUT_GAMEPAD structure when you query the controller state using XInputGetState. It is important to note that usability research has indicated that users can accidentally depress the digital thumbstick buttons during normal use. Another issue with the digital thumbstick buttons is that the user can inadvertently release a button when moving the thumbstick while it is depressed. Keep these facts in mind when designing the input model of your game; in general, try not to use a thumbstick for both movement and a button press. The D-Pad Again, there's not too much to say about the D-pad of the Xbox Controller. It works as you would expect it to. Conceptually, the D-pad is four distinct digital buttons. The state of the D-pad is reported in the same field of the XINPUT_GAMEPAD structure as the other digital buttons. You can safely assume that you will never receive a notification that UP and DOWN are pressed at the same time, or that LEFT and RIGHT are pressed at the same time.  Because the D-pad gives only four distinct readings, a diagonal D-pad position is reported as two neighboring positions. For instance, northeast would be represented as UP and RIGHT. But UP and RIGHT are separate digital buttons and will never be pressed at exactly the same time. The controller will detect either UP or RIGHT before detecting the other. Take this into account when designing your input model; do not assume the player can move from center to a diagonal position in one step. Analog Buttons There are eight analog buttons on the Xbox Controller: A, B, X, Y, Black, and White (and the left and right triggers, which are documented below). The firmware reports the state of an analog button as a value in the range of 0 (not pressed) to 255 (maximum pressure). The state of these buttons is stored in the bAnalogButtons field of the XINPUT_GAMEPAD structure when you query the controller state using XInputGetState. While the state of a button can contain 255 unique values, the controller will report only around 70 discrete values (scaled to the 0 255 range) for a given button.  Snapover When the user initially presses an analog button, there is some snapover. That is, it will take some force before the button registers a press. From the time the user starts pressing the button until the button hits the mechanical snapover, the firmware reports 0. When the button hits the snapover, the first reading will not be 1.  Even though the range of values spans from 0 to 255, the lower end of this range is hard to achieve. The analog button sits on a dome. When you first press the button, the dome compacts (to about 120), then expands a little (to about 60). At this point, you can compress to 255 or back up to 0, until the dome pops back out.   With use, the dome will wear, and the snapover will result in an initial reading as low as 60 (as opposed to the 120 snapover reported by a new controller). This generally happens after about 100,000 or so presses of the button. The following chart shows the relationship between the physical pressure that is applied to the button (shown in red) and the value that is reported by the system (shown in blue). Notice how the readings are affected when the button reaches the snapover point. Even though you are applying pressure, the system reports a value of zero. Also notice the spike at the top of the curve. At this point, the dome has reached its maximum compression and the pressure being exerted on the button is applied directly to the sensor underneath.  Crosstalk On some Xbox Controllers, when an analog button is pressed, other analog buttons on that controller may register a value above zero even though they are not depressed. This phenomenon is known as crosstalk. The maximum expected crosstalk seems to be about 30. There is a constant defined in the library called XINPUT_GAMEPAD_MAX_CROSSTALK. The title should ignore any value less than or equal to XINPUT_GAMEPAD_MAX_CROSSTALK that is reported by any analog button. And rather than using a range of 0 to 255 for acceptable analog button values, your title should take action only if the value reported by an analog button is in the range of XINPUT_GAMEPAD_MAX_CROSSTALK to 255. Analog Triggers There are two analog triggers on the Xbox Controller. The firmware will report the state of a trigger as a value in the range of 0 (not pressed) to 255 (fully depressed). While the range contains 255 unique values, the controller will initially report only around 150 discrete values (scaled to the 0 to 255 range). As the trigger is used, the resolution increases, and the controller will report more than 150 discrete values. But the controller will never report 255 discrete values, no matter how much the trigger is used. Thumbsticks There are two thumbsticks on the Xbox Controller. The firmware will report the state of a thumbstick as a value in the range of  32768 (fully left or up) to 32767 (fully right or down). While the range contains 65536 unique values, the controller will initially report only around 120 discrete values (scaled to the  32768 to 32767 range). As the thumbstick is used, the resolution increases, and the controller can report as many as (approximately) 160 discrete values. Dynamic Calibration When a user first connects the Xbox Controller or turns on the console, the resolution of the thumbsticks is limited. The Xbox Controller's firmware assumes that the thumbstick has about half of the freedom of movement that it actually has. As the Xbox Controller is used, the thumbsticks move beyond these assumed limits, and these new positions replace the initial estimated extremes as the new assumed extremes. This process repeats until the thumbstick hits the plastic casing of the Xbox Controller and can move no further. At that point, the assumed extremes correlate to the actual, physical limits of the hardware.  The underestimation and resampling are done to overcome minor manufacturing variations from controller to controller. The usable range of the thumbstick extends beyond the limits imposed by the casing of the Xbox Controller. When the circuitry of the Xbox Controller is placed inside of the casing, the thumbsticks will never be exactly centered (although they are well within the accepted manufacturing deviation). By determining the limits of the thumbstick's motion as the controller is used, the firmware can ensure that every Xbox Controller will behave in exactly the same way (even though no two controllers are exactly alike). The following chart shows the center position error, the default calibration range, the dynamic calibration range, and the (quite unreachable) joystick maximum range. Values are given in degrees, firmware counts, and XID counts. *Both the Default Calibration and the Dynamic Calibration have seven buffer counts inside of the endpoints of the calibration; for any raw value in that range, the output will be +32767 or  32768. In other words, the output will hit maximum value seven counts before reaching either endpoint of the calibration. Pay special attention to the Default Calibration and the Best Dynamic Cal sections. Notice how the center position error shrinks after calibration and how the reported range (Joystick Angle related to XID Counts) increases after calibration. Dead Center Thumbsticks never really come to rest in the exact center of their movable range. Because of manufacturing variations, the thumbstick can come to rest slightly to the left, right, top, or bottom of center. Another culprit in this off-centeredness is a phenomenon known as hysteresis. Hysteresis is a term used to describe the change in center position of the thumbstick when the thumbstick comes to rest from different directions. The physical properties of the thumbstick apparatus may cause the thumbstick to come to rest in a slightly different position if it is released from the extreme left than it would if released from the extreme right. The same is true for the top and bottom extremes, and for any combination thereof. On power up, the actual center position of the thumbstick lies somewhere within the center 61 percent of the usable range. As the thumbstick is used and the resolution of the range of allowable values increases, the range of values that the center position can occupy drops to about 20 percent. In other words, dynamic calibration eliminates the error introduced by manufacturing variations (about 41 percent) and leaves only the error attributed to hysteresis (about 20 percent). In general, the numbers quoted above should be worst-case scenarios. You can easily find Xbox Controllers that have much smaller center position errors (some smaller than 10 percent after dynamic calibration). The Dead Zone Unfortunately, there is no way to know whether or not the controller's firmware has calibrated a thumbstick. Calls to XInputGetState will always return the thumbstick position in the range  32768 to 32767, regardless of calibration. The dead zone is the area of the thumbstick that your title treats as center, and the title takes no action when the thumbstick lies within this zone. This area is some percentage of the usable area. Because the usable area grows as the thumbstick is calibrated, the dead zone grows with it. Before calibration, the center position may lie outside of the dead zone (because it is smaller before calibration), which may cause some drift. How you handle that drift is entirely up to you. There is no general solution that will work for all games. One solution might be to design the initial game menus so that the user moves the thumbstick from extreme to extreme before beginning any actual gameplay. The problem with this solution is that the user may add a new controller or replace an existing controller during the game. When a new controller is added, it is initially uncalibrated. In some games, such as racing titles, drift may not be a concern. After all, a little drift is natural in a car, and the amount of drift is greatly reduced (or eliminated) after dynamic calibration. Other games, such as puzzle titles, can bypass the initial drift by using a larger dead zone. Puzzle titles generally don't need as much thumbstick resolution as other titles and will likely treat the thumbstick much like a D-pad anyway. It is entirely up to you to decide how your title will handle dead zones before and after calibration. See the Technical Certification Sample for an example of switching dead zones. The Technical Certification Sample has two deadzones: one at X% and one at Y%. It initially uses X% as the deadzone. Once it determines that the stick has been pressed fully in all directions, it switches to Y%. Vibration There are two vibration motors on the Xbox Controller. The wLeftMotorSpeed and wRightMotorSpeed fields of the XINPUT_RUMBLE structure are used when calling XInputSetState to control the speed of the motors. These fields can contain a value in the range of 0x0000 (no motor use) to 0xFFFF (100-percent motor use).  In general, a motor at rest will not be set in motion by values below a certain threshold (although the motor may make a humming noise). Once the motor is in motion, the value can be dropped back down below this threshold without stopping the motor.  The left (low frequency) and right (high frequency) motors behave differently. The left motor starts spinning with a value of approximately 0x4268 and stops at about 0x1B58. The maximum rotations per minute for the left motor are about 2561 rpm. The right motor starts spinning with a value of approximately 0x34BC and stops at about 0x2134. The maximum rotations per minute for the right motor are about 4658 rpm. Data Acquisition and Input Report Latency Data Acquisition The Xbox Controllers acquire data in an executive loop. This loop is responsible for debouncing the digital buttons and reading the position of the analog buttons and thumbsticks from the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The details of this process have been tweaked to balance a number of competing goals: high precision, high repeatability, high responsiveness, low jitter, low cross-talk, and others. The result is a data acquisition loop that takes four milliseconds to produce a state packet of the device. This packet is the XINPUT_GAMEPAD. After the packet is complete, it is copied to a buffer for transmission across the USB wire, replacing the current state packet. This loop is not synchronized with the USB frame clock; the importance of this fact will be discussed later. For the sake of discussion, zero latency would mean that this data is available to the game as soon as this loop generates the packet. Data Transmission The USB interrupt pipe is a hardware-polled architecture. When software posts a request for data, the host hardware polls the device at a fixed interval (configurable by software) until the device responds with new data. The hardware polling interval is synchronous with the one-millisecond USB frame. This starts when the USB hardware is initialized with XInitDevices. When new data is received, the host hardware generates an interrupt, which is handled by the USB subsystem of the Xbox System Software. The Xbox Input Device (XID) subsystem is eventually called in the context of the interrupt's dispatch routine, where it copies the packet into a state buffer (of type XINPUT_STATE) and increments the dwPacketNumber member of the buffer. Notice that this entire process happens (essentially) while servicing interrupts and does not affect any of the game title's threads. The game controller will transmit the same data only once. Thus, after the state is transmitted, the device will be silent until the executive loop completes again and posts a different data packet. The XInput API and Polling Modes From the time a device is opened with XInputOpen, the XID subsystem always maintains a buffer of the last known state of the device. As mentioned above, this buffer is updated in response to interrupts, and dwPacketNumber is incremented whenever it changes. XInputGetState always copies that buffer into the caller's buffer and returns immediately. XInputOpen, particularly the pPollingParameters argument, and XInputPoll can be used to control the way the state buffer is maintained. Two fields are relevant for input: fAutoPoll and bInputInterval. The other fields are discussed below in the section on output. Passing NULL for pPollingParameters effectively sets fAutoPoll to TRUE and bInputInterval to 8. bInputInterval is the fixed hardware polling interval discussed above. The hardware can poll only at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8,16, or 32 milliseconds, so bInputInterval is rounded down to the nearest value. AutoPoll If fAutoPoll is TRUE, the XID subsystem requests input automatically. This means that before XInputOpen returns, a request is submitted to the hardware to get data. In the interrupt processing, when data is retrieved, the request is resubmitted to continue getting data. The net effect is that the hardware is always being polled at bInputInterval (appropriately rounded down). What is the latency in the auto poll case? First, there is the bInputInterval. Because hardware polling is synchronized with the USB frame and data acquisition is not, the delay between the completion of data acquisition and the next poll is random. The poll may come immediately after the loop completes, or it may take up to bInterval milliseconds. Furthermore, if bInterval is greater than four milliseconds, entire packets may get thrown away.  Before you loose any sleep over this, you must first decide if you could have used this data anyway. It is nearly impossible for a user to a press a button for a duration of under about 20 milliseconds anyway, and if they did, there is a good chance that they just nicked it by mistake while trying to press a different one. The thumbsticks move continuously and there is no need to acquire the position more often than your game can process it anyway. The second source of latency is from the time the interrupt is raised until the new data is copied into the state buffer. This time span is more difficult to quantify. On an otherwise idle system, this process will typically require about a millisecond (USB only raises interrupts on the start of a one-millisecond frame). However, with lots of other interrupt processes (especially DVD, hard disk, and audio) occurring in the background, this latency could be longer. A very conservative upper bound is about two milliseconds. Finally, there is the time between when the state buffer is updated and when the game calls XInputGetState and begins processing the data. This latency depends on how often the game calls XInputGetState.   So, in the default polling mode (that is, bInterval is 8 milliseconds), the typical latency will be about 12 to 13 milliseconds for a game calling XInputGetState every 16 milliseconds. The best case will be under 1 millisecond, and the worst case will be about 25 to 26 milliseconds. Keep in mind that it is difficult to compare these numbers to other systems, as we have carefully laid out all the factors and what affects them. ManualPoll If fAutoPoll is FALSE, XInputPoll must be called to submit a data request.  XInputOpen still acquires the initial state of the device (through a non-interrupt mechanism), but now the state of the device will not be updated without regular calls to XInputPoll. At this point, you should have enough information to figure out all the scenarios and calculate the best and worst case latency, and so on. The one interesting case is using manual polling to synchronize with the video frame while reducing interrupts. In this case, you would set fAutoPoll to FALSE and set bInterval to one millisecond.  Then you must arrange to call XInputPoll about two to three milliseconds before the end of the game's render loop. This assumes that the game starts each render loop by acquiring state and calculating new physics based on the state of the controller. When XInputPoll is called, a request is posted. The hardware will be polled within a millisecond. If there is any new data to report, it will be reported at that time. The interrupt will be raised and processed within one to two milliseconds. The next call to XInputGetState will retrieve the freshest data available, with a latency of only about two to three milliseconds. Furthermore, because you submit requests only at your game's frame rate, there are no extraneous interrupts providing data that gets discarded anyway. (The USB CPU overhead is so low though, you probably won't notice unless the game really pushes the CPU limits already.)   The big caveat here is that the call to XInputPoll has to be placed very judiciously. If it is called too late, you will always be a frame behind. If it called too soon, the latency is slightly larger. Vibration Vibration has two options for transmission. One is USB interrupt output; the other is USB control output. Like interrupt input, interrupt output works on a fixed schedule. This guarantees that if XInputOpen succeeds, you will be to send data at the specified interval. Control output is not scheduled and sends the data as soon as possible. In either case, the firmware adjusts the vibration motor outputs as soon as it receives the data. On a bus with little control or bulk traffic, such as an Xbox with the currently available peripherals, control output is transmitted within microseconds and provides much better performance. (The only exception may be when trying to manipulate the vibration motors while writing to a couple memory units simultaneously. This is strongly discouraged anyway.) Thus, control output is the default. This can be overridden by changing fInterruptOut in the pPollingParameters argument to XInputOpen. If fInterruptOut is TRUE, bOutputInterval sets the interval as it does in the interrupt input case.  Calculating the latencies is left as an exercise. USB Bus Bandwidth Control data and bulk data, used by USB enumeration, the memory units, and possibly for vibration output, is unscheduled and the bandwidth is unreserved. The data is submitted and transmitted on a priority system that is close to first in, first out (FIFO). (Control has a slightly higher priority. And in really busy conditions, small transmissions may go before longer ones that were submitted earlier.) Interrupt (game controller input) and isochronous (used by the voice peripheral) bandwidth is reserved when a device is opened. So for example, when XInputOpen succeeds, it is guaranteed that input data will always be transmitted without delay. This always leaves open the possibility that the schedule will fill up. In this case, XInputOpen would fail. The amount of bandwidth required is determined by bInputInterval and bOutputInterval (only if fInterruptOut is TRUE). If bInputInterval is smaller, more bandwidth must be reserved (even in the manual polling cases). With four game controllers on the system, it should be possible to open all four controllers with a one-millisecond polling interval on input and output, and still use only about a quarter of the available bandwidth. However, in the future (with voice peripherals for example), there may be a need to be more careful. CPU Overhead The overhead of this process is minimal. Most of the time, the USB host hardware is doing the work without using any other system resources. The interrupt processing occurs in two steps. First, the interrupt occurs, and only a few instructions are executed to disable USB interrupts and queue a DPC request (a driver concept from Microsoft  Windows NT ). The DPC routine notifies the proper subsystem that its data transfer is complete and allows the subsystem to do any additional processing. We have not done extensive profiling of this process, but we can place an upper bound of about one eighth of one percent of CPU utilization for a single game controller in continuous use, with the default polling parameters. Adding additional controllers will increase this, but negligibly. Other Controllers The Xbox Controller that ships with the Xbox console is not the only type of controller that will be used. To query a controller for its capabilities, call XInputGetCapabilities.  If the user plugs in a steering wheel peripheral or a light gun peripheral, XInputGetCapabilities could be used to determine that a certain button is missing, and the title could handle it accordingly. XInputGetCapabilities can also be used to determine the resolution of the analog components of the controller. If the title expects a certain resolution of input values for an analog button, thumbstick, or trigger, you can easily determine the current controller's capabilities and scale the inputs as needed.  There is no need to try to support every possible peripheral subtype, but it may make sense to add a controller translation layer to the title to help map game functions to different controller types. For a list of controller subtypes and how they map to one another, please see the Custom Controller Key Mapping Defaults section of the  Xbox Third-Party Peripheral Requirements  document on the Xbox developer Web site  at http://xds.xbox.com.  You should always check the subtype of the controller using XInputGetCapabilities to determine the layout of the current controller. Even the standard Xbox Controller (XINPUT_DEVSUBTYPE_GC_GAMEPAD) and the Xbox Controller S (XINPUT_DEVSUBTYPE_GC_GAMEPAD_ALT) have different button layouts.   PAGE   PAGE

The pixel shader takes as per-pixel input both constants and vertex-shader-produced interpolants such as strq and diffuse color, and emits per-pixel ARGB fragment values for blending into the frame buffer. The functionality of the pixel shader and its relationship to the rest of the GPU pipeline will be discussed in detail in a future white paper. For the purposes of this paper, pixel shader pipeline will refer to the circuitry that performs the above-described processing for a single pixel. By this definition, the Xbox GPU contains four complete pixel shader pipelines, which work in parallel. At any given time, all pixel shader pipelines are configured to process the same texture address op and register combiner operations, but each does so for a different pixel. Each pixel shader pipeline is capable of processing at a maximum rate of one pixel per clock (this rate is supported with up to two 1-D or 2-D textures or cubemaps up to two textures address ops and two register combiner stages enabled; performance is anywhere from two to ten times slower with with more texture ops or with different ones, such as ones involving dot products). Thus, given the 250-MHz GPU clock, the pixel shader can process up to 1 Gpix/s. Higher effective throughput can result from circuitry that rejects many occluded pixels before they ever make it to the pixel shader, and also from multisampling, which causes the output of each pixel shader pipeline to be written to 2 or 4 frame buffer subsamples. However, 1 Gpix/s is the maximum rate at which visible pixels can actually be processed. As with all maximum specified rates, this rate will be approached but not achieved in actual practice. One reason is that there will inevitably be times at which the pixel shader has to wait, either for rasterization data to come down to the pixel shader from the vertex and triangle processors, or for memory bandwidth for accessing the frame and z buffers to become available so that the result can be stored. Another reason is that the four pixel shader pipelines can only work in parallel under certain circumstances, as discussed next. Pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions First, on any one clock, the four pixel shader pipelines can only work on pixels belonging to a single triangle. This means that if you were to draw, say, four 1-pixel triangles in a row, it would take a minimum of 4 clocks, and three of the pixel shader pipelines would remain idle during each clock, unable to work in parallel with the one active pixel shader pipeline because there are no other pixels to work on in the current triangle. Consequently, the pixel shader fill rate for very small triangles can range as low as 250 Mpix/s. There is a second restriction that similarly has the greatest impact on small triangles. Before explaining the restriction, we first have to define a quad: a 2x2 block of pixels, starting at even row and column addresses. Consider the following figure of the portion of the frame buffer controlling the upper-left corner of the screen:  Pixels (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) together constitute a quad. Pixels (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), and (5,7) constitute another quad. The restriction is that the four pixel shader pipelines can draw to only one quad on any given clock. No matter whether 1, 2, 3, or 4 pixels of a given quad are covered by a triangle, that quad will tie up all four pixel shader pipelines while it s being drawn. For example, consider the following triangle: The triangle draws pixels in five quads; therefore (assuming that there are no more than two textures or two register combiners enabled), it will take 5 clocks to get through the pixel shader. Only when drawing the quad containing (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), and (3,3) will all four pixel shader pipelines be in action at once. In the clock during which the quad containing (1,3) is drawn, only one pixel shader pipeline will be active; likewise for (3,1). In all, there are 10 pixels in the triangle, so the effective pixel shader fill rate for this triangle will be 2 pixels/clock, or 500 Mpix/s, rather than the maximum 1 Gpix/s of which the pixel shader is capable under ideal circumstances. Now that we understand them, the two pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions can be rolled into a single sentence: The four pixel shader pipelines can draw in parallel only to a single quad of a single triangle. Impact of pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions Obviously, the effects of the pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions vary quite a bit with triangle placement and size. The impact decreases rapidly with size, which is important because smaller triangles tend to be setup-bound, while larger triangles tend to be fill-bound and it is on larger triangles that the fill rate of the Xbox GPU approaches 1 Gpix/s. Thus, although the restrictions on pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism do reduce real-world fill rate somewhat, the impact should be somewhere between nonexistent and small when the pixel shader is configured for 1-clock operation (no more than two texture address ops and no more than two register combiners enabled). Just so this doesn t sound like hand-waving, let s take a minute to explain why fill rate is not typically a limiting factor for small triangles, at least in fast pixel-shader configurations. (The following discussion assumes a 1-cycle/pixel pixel-shader configuration.) First, consider that triangles that contain no pixels at all of which there are typically quite a few when drawing small triangles are rejected before they ever get to the pixel shader. Also, rendering speed for small triangles tends to be dominated by vertex- and triangle-level work, not fill. Triangle setup takes 2 cycles. Vertex setup usually takes longer than 2 cycles, potentially much longer depending on the sophistication of hardware lighting or vertex programming. Somewhere between half a vertex and three vertices need to be processed per triangle, so setup time per triangle will be somewhere between 2 and dozens of cycles.  Even 2 cycles/triangle (achievable only with most rendering capabilities turned off and with near-ideal vertex caching) is long enough to allow the pixel shader pipelines to process a triangle between 2 and 6 pixels in size, depending on how the triangle is quad-aligned. With more realistic features selected, the pixel shader pipelines can handle considerably larger triangles. For example, with one infinite light and two textures enabled, T&L will consume 6 cycles per triangle with okay-but-not-ideal vertex sharing (approximately one vertex processed per triangle). 6 cycles is enough time to draw 6 quads, covering in the neighborhood of 9-12 pixels. (Note an interesting effect: as triangles get larger, most quads unavoidably have at least 2 pixels, and with non-extreme height/width ratios, an increasing number of quads have 3 or 4 pixels, so larger triangles can t help getting pretty good pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism.) With more and/or more expensive hardware lighting (such as local lights), or with poor vertex sharing, the pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions become less and less likely to be a bottleneck. Consider, for example, the case of no vertex sharing at all three vertices processed per triangle, as in the case of dynamically-generated terrain where no vertices can be shared, or meshes where each vertex has a different normal for every triangle it s part of in which case 18 infinite-light, two-texture quads can be drawn per triangle, enough for dozens of pixels. Beyond this triangle size, fill rate will tend to dominate performance (unless there are a lot of lights or a complex vertex shader program), but the effect of pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions on fill rate will be small, because most quads will be interior to their triangles and will be entirely drawn. Granted, if all the triangles were very long in one dimension but only 1 pixel in the other, that could cut fill rate in half, but it would be a very unlikely event to have very many triangles of that sort and that s the worst case for triangles large enough to have fill rate be the dominant performance factor. Finally, note that multisampling takes the output of each pixel shader pipeline and replicates it to up to 2 or 4 subsamples; only z is processed with subsample accuracy. This means that the pixel shader fill rate per screen pixel is exactly the same with multisampling as without. (Don t confuse the preceding rate the pixel shader fill rate per pixel with the pixel shader fill rate per subsample, which is four times higher with multisampling than without.) Impact with slower pixel-shader-pipeline configurations The effects of the quad restrictions become potentially more significant when the pixel shader is configured for slower-than-1-cycle operation. Obviously, the effect is most pronounced when 7 or 8 register combiners are in use, resulting in processing times of 4 cycles/quad; in this case, all of the above performance calculations have to be divided by four. The effect is less pronounced for 5 or 6 register combiners 3 cycles/quad and less so yet for 3 or 4 register combiners or 3 or 4 texture address ops, where the performance is 2 cycles/quad. Nonetheless, it is quite possible that fill rate in general, including the small-triangle fill rate degradation resulting from the pixel-shader-pipeline parallelism restrictions, will become a significant bottleneck when the pixel shader is configured for slower-than-1-cycle operation. Balancing this is that configurations of the above sort do a lot of per-pixel work, so each pixel reflects more sophisticated shading than in the 1-cycle configurations, and presumably has correspondingly more rendering value, so fewer passes or polygons are required overall. But that s a bit of rationalization; the fact is, what you really want is to turn on all the pixel shading capabilities without any performance cost, but that s just not the way it is. Graphics programming inevitably involves compromises between features and performance, and balancing pixel-shader speed and power is one of those tradeoffs. If you are going to use slower pixel-shader configurations and you have relatively large triangles, you may find it useful to use slower, more powerful vertex shading than normal; because the vertex shader coprocesses with the pixel shader, you will be able to add features to and thereby slow down the vertex shader with little performance impact, so long as the pixel shader remains the bottleneck. Likewise, if you have a slow vertex shader, you might consider using a slower and more powerful pixel-shader configuration. Summary In summary, whether the quad restrictions have an impact on performance, and the extent of this impact, is a function of a limited set of factors: The four pixel shader pipelines can operate in parallel process multiple pixels during a single cycle only for pixels belonging a single triangle. The four pixel shader pipelines can operate in parallel only when drawing pixels in a single quad that is, a single 2x2 even-aligned pixel block. The minimum time that a single pixel shader pipeline that is programmed only with 1-D or 2-D textures or cubemaps takes to process a pixel is described by: T = max(texaddrop(# texture address op stages),regcomb(# register combiner stages)) where texaddrop(x) is defined as follows: texaddrop(x) and regcomb(x) is defined as follows: regcomb(x) Note that the final combiner is not considered a stage here. The above describes minimum pixel-processing time per pixel shader pipeline; actual processing time may be longer due to waits for texel fetches or because of delays in earlier or later parts of the pipeline that force the pixel shader to wait. Because of the quad-oriented nature of pixel shading, it should be clear that if any single pixel shader pipeline is forced to wait, the other three pixel shader pipelines will also have to wait. In addition, texture ops other than 1-D or 2-D textures or cubemaps are slower, ranging as high as 10 clocks per pixel for dot product reflection. This will be discussed in another paper. Whether and the extent to which pixel shader performance is a bottleneck is determined not by the absolute performance of the pixel shader but rather by the performance of the pixel shader relative to the T&L part of the graphics pipeline. Since T&L processes a triangle at a time, the relevant basis for performance comparisons with the pixel shader is on a per-triangle basis. The factors affecting the per-pixel performance of the pixel shader are described in 1 3, above. These, together with triangle size, determine per-triangle pixel shader performance. Factors that affect T&L performance are data fetching (affected by the size, memory locality, and caching of vertices) and vertex shading performance (number and type of lights, length of vertex shading program if any, number of vertex attributes, and vertex caching). Vertex caching and T&L peformance factors are  will beis discussed in a future <vertex caching paper>the paper  Xbox Transform and Lighting Data Flow. ; T&L performance factors in general will beare discussed in detail in a future paper as well<TBW >.

Showcase Xbox games technology. Educate and inform RSPs and consumers. The demo disc will be updated at retail every other month using two different methods: Xbox Field Reps.  The demo disc will be updated and installed by the reps at their serviced store locations.  Direct-to-Store Mailings.  The demo disc will be sent directly to non-serviced and some specific account locations for the RSPs to update. Playable game demos not only give consumers an opportunity to play the game firsthand, but they also work as an invaluable marketing and PR tool. To that end, playable and non-playable demos should be an integral part of any marketing/PR plan. When a playable demo is not available, there is simply no better way to generate hype than through the use of non-playable demos. Screenshots simply can t do a game justice, particularly when it comes to portraying the incredible visual and aural experiences made possible by Xbox. Non-playable demos are a perfect way to showcase levels the playable demos won t cover, build consumer awareness, and stir up some excitement over your upcoming title. It is vitally important that publishers make developers aware of the need for a demo as early in the development process as possible. Publishers should make sure developers understand that a demo disc will ultimately bring better sales figures, and subsequently, more developer royalties. By preparing demos, movies, and so on to coincide with editorial coverage and ad campaigns, you can make a huge impression on gamers and really show them what your game is all about. CREATING A PLAYABLE DEMO  1. PRESENTATION AND USABILITY REQUIREMENTS The Presentation and Usability Requirements define how the demo should unveil, step by step, as well as how the user should interact with it. 1.1  PRESENTATION FLOW CHART The following chart summarizes the flow between the states of the game demo: 1.1.1  LAUNCHING THE INTERACTIVE DEMO DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER TITLE SCREENS This screen should contain the logo of the Developer and/or the Publisher. It s the first thing to be shown. It should stay on the screen for no longer than three seconds. GAME TITLE SCREEN The Game Title Screen is the main menu of the game. If the game demo doesn t feature menus, the Game Title Screen should read  Press START to begin  and  Press BACK to exit.  If the game demo does feature menus (limited or detailed), they should be displayed and should contain an option that can be selected to quit. GAME CONTROL SCREEN  A Game Control Screen is an image of the Xbox Controller with instructions about how to play the game. It should appear when the user starts the demo. This image should clearly read  Press START to continue  and should remain on the screen until the user presses START or A. At that point, the user plays the demo. 1.1.2  IN-GAME MENU While the user is playing the demo, if START is pressed, an In-Game Menu should appear. The following three options should be provided (with any other options that your demo must provide): View Game Controls This option should bring up the Control Screen. Restart Demo This option returns the user to the Game Title Screen. Quit to Demos Menu This option quits the Interactive Demo. 1.1.3  QUITTING THE INTERACTIVE DEMO Publishers may create an ending screen that states when the final game will be available, contains a list of features in the final game, gives hints, and/or displays any other marketing messages to the player that are pertinent to the demo or final game. From this screen, users will be returned to the Official Xbox Magazine Game Disc interface after a period of time no longer than five seconds. 2. TECHNICAL GUIDELINES The technical guidelines for Xbox interactive demos are detailed in the document  Xbox Demo Technical Guidelines,  which is available on the Xbox Developer Support Web site. The major benefit of following these guidelines is that it guarantees that the interactive demo will work equally well in any of a number of situations.  3. CONTENT SUGGESTIONS Suggestions to help in the preparation of the Interactive Demo. 3.1  GENERAL SUGGESTIONS The Interactive Demo should provide approximately 15 minutes of original gameplay. Xbox defines original gameplay as the time it takes to get familiar with the controls and complete the objectives of the demo. The playable demo should feature moderately challenging gameplay. The experience will be more enjoyable if the user doesn t run into problems they can t solve or into situations they can hardly overcome.  The game demo may use more than one game control screen. If this is the case,  the screens should simply be displayed one after the other.  If the game features some cinematic sequences for introduction, they can be presented either before the initial Game Title Screen appears or right after the game demo is launched. It should be possible to interrupt these sequences by pressing either START or A.  3.2  DEMO CONTENT SUGGESTIONS The developer is responsible for the content of the demo. Following are some general questions and ideas to help the developer choose the content of the demo, depending on the genre of the game.  GENERAL What are the features that are unique to your game? How can you emphasize some of these features in a game demo? Is there a gameplay element you should insist on? ROLE PLAYING GAME / STORY DRIVEN GAMES How much of the storyline do you have to reveal to catch the interest of the player? Does it make sense to use cinematic sequences to introduce the context of the game and the character? What do you want the player to accomplish? Is there a simple objective that can be aimed for so that the user gets a glimpse of the combat system, different attacks and spells, and different creatures? RACING GAMES What are the strong points of your racer? Is it how realistic it is? Is it how fast or how arcade-like it is? Is it the splendid environment of the tracks? How can you highlight this and make it stand out from other similar racers? ACTION / FIRST PERSON SHOOTER What actions are unique to your game? Can the character swim, fly, or jump? Does your game feature any innovative weapon or fighting system? What s the best way to let the player experiment with those? SPORTS GAMES How does your game improve on the other sports titles out there? For example, how is your hockey game different from all the other ones? Is it because of its advanced AI or because of its incredible level of realism? FIGHTING GAMES How do combos / special moves / counters work in your game? And how can you show the player how to execute these actions? What original characters should you show in a demo?  What should be the location of the fight? Should it display some exceptional graphical feature of the game engine? CREATING A NON-PLAYABLE DEMO PRESENTATION Non-playable demos are typically 45 second videos used to generate hype before a playable demo can be published. Traditional Hollywood movie trailers are great examples of the style, quality, and overall presentation. Non-playable demos should include a single title screen with the name of the publisher or game, footage of actual gameplay, and footage of intros and/or cut-scenes. Ideally the preview trailer should not only get the viewer excited about the way a game looks and sounds, but also hint at its underlying story or premise.  RECOMMENDED ELEMENTS Title screen (game name, publisher, developer). ESRB rating of the final game (if one does not exist,  Rating Pending  should be displayed). At least 30 seconds of actual in-game play. High production value, similar to Hollywood movie trailers. Rendered intro sequences and cut scenes (to help convey story). Narration is recommended to add impact. Text can be used to help convey features or story elements. LENGTH Ideal running time is approximately 45 seconds. Non-playable demos should not exceed one minute, but exceptions can be made   please contact us in advance if you wish to provide a longer sequence. ENDING A NON-PLAYABLE DEMO Publishers may consider displaying a single ending screen that states when the final game will be available, contains a list of features in the final game, gives hints, and/or displays any other messages to the player pertinent to the game being previewed. From this screen, users should be returned to the interface. This screen should be displayed no longer than five seconds. PLAYABLE DEMO SUBMISSION PROCEDURE PROCESS The first step is to submit your demo to Microsoft for certification. All playable demos must pass through the Xbox certification process before they are approved for publication. This process is very similar to full-game certification and is controlled entirely by Microsoft. It requires filling out a certification form and and delivering your demo to the certification team on appropriate media. Demo certification is done on a first come first served basis and can take anywhere from 7 to 14 days. Please account for this duration in your schedule, as demos that do not make it through certification in time will NOT make the targeted disc. Contact your Xbox Account Manager for schedule details. All playable demos must be certified prior to the noted  CONTENT DELIVERED  scheduled deadline. Please contact your account manager to make arrangements.  All demos must be submitted in full accordance with the requirements set forth in the Xbox Guide. All demos must be submitted with a launcher utility which launches the demo and passes it data in the same manner as described in the technical guidelines. The Xdemos launcher is provided on the Xbox Developer Support Web site for use in testing and submitting demos.  Playable demos can be submitted to: Xbox Certification Group Attention: Debby Engevik 18500 Union Hill Road Redmond, WA  98052 In addition to Microsoft s certification form, you must fill out a Retail Interactive Demo Disc Submission Form, which can be found at the end of this document. Please include a submission form with all playable demos to ensure proper processing.

The Xbox Guide can be found online at   HYPERLINK "http://xds.xbox.com"  http://xds.xbox.com , the Xbox support Web site for publishers and developers. Access to this Web site can be obtained through your account manager. If you do not know how to contact your account manager, please send e-mail to   HYPERLINK "mailto:xbox@xbox.com"  xbox@xbox.com The demos will be certified based on the full game TCR with additional restrictions placed.

This gives you the option of letterbox or standard 4:3 full-screen image size. NTSC (4:3) PAL (for European markets) Accepted submission formats: We strongly recommend that all materials be provided in digital format. DV or MiniDV formats are our first preference; however, Digi-Beta is also an excellent choice. While we do accept Beta-SP tapes, we recommend against this option as it does not always produce the level of quality we are shooting for. Each video trailer submission should contain two tapes: one VHS version for easy viewing and one professional quality version to be published. (See Submission of Materials for submission details.) DV/MiniDV (preferred) and VHS Digi-Beta (preferred) and VHS Beta-SP and VHS SIZE LIMITATIONS  The Xbox Retail Interactive Demo Disc is a DVD-9 (8.54-GB capacity) format DVD. The total amount of space available for demos, trailers, and other extra materials is 6.4 GB. Unless a special arrangement is made, please try to keep preview trailers under one minute in length.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox Secure Network Library Title _PID_HLINKSXbox Secure Network Library Colin James O'Neill Normal.dot Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 10.0y. Secure communication is one of the foundations of the Xbox. The Xbox Secure Network Library (SNL) handles all Xbox communication, whether that communication is Xbox(Xbox or Xbox(server. The Xbox SNL is based on the Winsock API, with one very important difference: it s cryptographically secured. Packets are encrypted (by default) and stamped with authenticating hash values. When an Xbox receives a packet, the packet can be verified against the hash value. If any data has been changed in transit, the packet will fail authentication and will be thrown away. This solves the issues of packet tampering at a very low level. Games themselves don t need to support any additional mechanism for preventing these types of game cheats. Authentication is always enabled. Encryption is enabled by default but may be turned off on a per-socket, per-message basis to increase performance. Converting existing Winsock code to use the Xbox Security Network Library is a matter of calling some new initialization functions and establishing a secure connection. Once a connection has been established, the standard Winsock calls apply. The code snippets below are based on the WinsockPeer sample in the Xbox SDK, a simple peer-to-peer Xbox game. See the WinsockPeer code for the full implementation of the concepts shown. In the code examples, error checking has been removed for clarity. Your game should check for and handle errors appropriately. Checking the Xbox Connection Status Xbox titles must allow the player to play a network multiplayer game only when the Xbox is physically connected to another Xbox via an Xbox System Link Cable or connected to a hub. A title can detect a valid physical connection by calling XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus(). This function can be safely invoked prior to calling any network initialization routines. If the function returns zero, the Xbox is not connected. Otherwise the Xbox is connected, and additional information about the connection is provided in the return value. BOOL IsXboxConnected()    DWORD dwStatus = XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus();    return( dwStatus != 0 ); To meet Xbox Technical Certification Requirements (TCRs), the connection status must be checked in the main game loop at least once per second, and the game must display appropriate UI informing the player that the network cable was disconnected. XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus() is very fast, on the order of three to four microseconds. Initializing the Xbox Network Library Once the connection status has been verified, the game can initialize the Xbox SNL. There are two initialization routines required: XNetStartup() and the standard Winsock WSAStartup(). For the default SNL parameters, call XNetStartup() with NULL.  // Default SNL initialization INT err = XNetStartup( NULL ); To customize the parameters, use the XNetStartupParams structure. Set the first field to the size of the structure (used for versioning). To obtain a default parameter, set that parameter to zero. The default settings are documented in the winsockx.h header file. // Change receive buffer size to 32 K (default is 16 K) // All other parameters will be set to default values XNetStartupParams xnsp; ZeroMemory( &xnsp, sizeof(xnsp) ); xnsp.cfgSizeOfStruct = sizeof(xnsp); xnsp.cfgSockDefaultRecvBufsizeInK = 32; INT err = XNetStartup( &xnsp ); Once the Xbox SNL has been successfully initialized, call WSAStartup() to do the standard Winsock initialization. The Xbox allows all versions of Winsock up through 2.2 (that is, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2), although it technically supports only and exactly what is specified in the Xbox network documentation, not necessarily the Winsock functional specification. // Init Winsock WSADATA wsaData; INT err = WSAStartup( MAKEWORD(2,2), &wsaData ); The network library can be shut down and removed from memory by calling WSACleanup() and then XNetCleanup(). System Link Play Xbox system link play is in effect when any of the following are true: An Xbox is directly connected to another Xbox using the system link cable. A system link cable is simply an Ethernet crossover cable.  An Xbox is connected to an Ethernet hub (bridge) with an Ethernet cable. To meet TCRs, a maximum of 16 Xbox consoles can communicate with each other via a hub. An Xbox is connected to a local area network (LAN). Up to 16 Xbox consoles on the same subnet can communicate with each other. The Xbox does not support communication across different subnets. The Xbox does not officially support LAN play. In other words, LAN play will work for many players (those on the same subnet), but not necessarily all players (those on different subnets). In general, system link play describes an Xbox that is  connected  but not on the Internet. Because games running in system link mode don t have access to any external servers, including DNS or Xbox servers, they must advertise and discover their own game sessions. The following sections describe how games can support system link play. Many of these techniques will also apply to Internet games, but this paper focuses specifically on system link play. Finding a Game Once a game has verified its connection status and initialized the SNL, it can discover if any Xbox consoles are hosting game sessions. With system link play, there are no external servers that track game sessions, so the only way to discover active game sessions is to send a message to all connected Xbox consoles via an Ethernet broadcast. To create a broadcast socket, create a UDP socket and set the SO_BROADCAST option. The following code creates a broadcast socket. // Create UDP socket SOCKET sBrd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP ); // Set broadcast option BOOL bBroadcast = TRUE; INT err = setsockopt( sBrd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_BROADCAST,                       (const char*)&bBroadcast,                       sizeof( bBroadcast ) ); Use this socket to broadcast a game discovery message. This message can contain any useful information about the requesting client, but it will typically have only two important pieces of data: A message ID. If multiple types of messages are issued on the same port, the message ID is used to distinguish the message payloads. If the only messages issued on a given port are game discovery messages, then the port itself is the identifier and the message ID is not required. A nonce used to uniquely identify the client. A nonce is a random number used for a single transaction. When an active game session is discovered, the host cannot reply directly to us, because we don t have a secure channel established yet. The host must instead broadcast a response to all connected Xbox consoles. To distinguish between our game discovery request and other requests, the host replies with the same nonce that it received. Use a nonce of at least 8 bytes to minimize the chance of duplicates. // Game discovery message payload struct FindGame    BYTE ID;    BYTE Nonce[8]; The Xbox API includes a function that can be used to generate nonces called XNetRandom(). For details on this function, see the section entitled Random Number Generation. // Generate nonce and fill out discovery message payload FindGame findGame; findGame.ID = MSG_FIND_GAME; INT err = XNetRandom( findGame.Nonce, sizeof(findGame.Nonce) ); Now the game discovery request can be issued by broadcasting the message to all connected Xbox consoles. For security, any broadcast message sent by an Xbox is always automatically encrypted. The following code shows how to issue a broadcast game discovery message. Use the broadcast socket created above. The port number you choose for broadcast messages is entirely up to the game. Any port number in the range 1 through 65535 is valid. // Create broadcast address SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_BROADCAST; saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); // Broadcast the message to all system link Xbox consoles INT err = sendto( sBrd, (const char*)(&findGame),                   sizeof(findGame), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                    sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN) ); The discovery phase must last no longer than three seconds (a system link TCR). If no responses have been received within that time, no game hosts are available and the title should display an appropriate message. If a response is received, it will contain information about the game host that will allow a secure connection to be established. Multiple responses may be received, indicating that there are multiple game hosts on the network. The Xbox SNL ensures that a title will only send messages to and receive messages from other Xbox consoles running the same game. Details about the host response are given in the next section. Hosting a Game Hosting a game requires the same networking startup sequence as described above. To host a game, a title must additionally acquire its Xbox address and create a session key that uniquely identifies the game. An Xbox address is called an XNADDR. The XNADDR structure contains the information required to completely and uniquely identify any Xbox on either a system link network or on the Internet, even if that Xbox is communicating through network address translation (NAT). The component of the XNADDR structure used by system link play is the Ethernet media access control (MAC) address of the Xbox. To acquire the Xbox address, call XNetGetTitleXnAddr(). This call is asynchronous, because it requires a few seconds to acquire the IP address. When linking with the current version of the secure library (XNETS.LIB), this call is synchronous, because it only acquires the Ethernet MAC address, but in future online releases, this function will also acquire the IP address, so it s important to check the return value and handle the XNET_GET_XNADDR_PENDING condition. XNADDR xnHostAddr; DWORD dwStatus;    // Repeat while pending; OK to do other work in this loop    dwStatus = XNetGetTitleXnAddr( &xnHostAddr ); } while( dwStatus == XNET_GET_XNADDR_PENDING ); // Error checking if( dwStatus == XNET_GET_XNADDR_NONE )    return FALSE; To create a session identifier, call XNetCreateKey() and XNetRegisterKey(). The XNetCreateKey() function generates an XNKID/XNKEY pair by filling both structures with random numbers. See the section Random Number Generation for more details. The XNetRegisterKey() function informs the network stack to  listen  for incoming requests from other Xbox consoles that are using the same session key. XNKID xnHostKeyID; XNKEY xnHostKey; INT err = XNetCreateKey( &xnHostKeyID, &xnHostKey ); err = XNetRegisterKey( &xnHostKeyID, &xnHostKey ); When a game session is finished, call XNetUnregisterKey() to stop accepting packets from any Xbox that is using the matching XNKID/XNKEY session. Once the title has acquired its Xbox address and has registered a session, it s ready to accept game discovery messages and reply with information about the game. The following code creates a socket that listens for broadcast messages. // Create UDP socket SOCKET sLBrd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP ); // Bind to INADDR_ANY SOCKADDR_IN sa; sa.sin_family = AF_INET; sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; sa.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); INT err = bind( sLBrd, (const sockaddr*)( &sa ),                 sizeof( SOCKADDR_IN ) ); // Make socket non-blocking DWORD dwNonBlocking = 1; err = ioctlsocket( sLBrd, FIONBIO, &dwNonBlocking ); In the main game loop, check to see if any game discovery messages have been sent from other Xbox consoles. // See if any game discovery broadcasts have been received FindGame findGame; INT iBytes = recv( sLBrd, (char*)(&findGame),                             sizeof(findGame), 0 ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(findGame) )    if( findGame.ID == MSG_FIND_GAME )       // reply with  game found  message Game clients need four important pieces of information to verify the discovery message, display useful information about the session, and establish a secure connection to the game host: The nonce received from the client must be sent back so that the client can verify that this response is meant for him. A secure connection between the host and the client hasn t been established yet, so the host must reply with a broadcast message. In order to distinguish the message, the client must compare the nonce it generated with the nonce it receives back from the host. If the nonces match, the message was meant for the client. If not, the client must ignore the message, because it was meant for a different Xbox console. The session name. If the client displays this name in the list of sessions that can be joined, the session name must be broadcast. The name must be a non-technical descriptive name for the session (system link TCR). The XNKID/XNKEY pair of the host session. This data will enable a secure session to be established between the host and the client. The XNADDR of the host. This address will allow messages to be sent directly to the host rather than broadcast to all Xbox consoles. // Game found message payload struct GameFound    BYTE   ID;           // message ID    WCHAR  GameName[32]; // generated by host    BYTE   Nonce[8];     // copy of nonce from client    XNKID  KeyID;        // from XNetCreateKey()    XNKEY  Key;          // from XNetCreateKey()    XNADDR HostAddr;     // from XNetGetTitleXnAddr() // Fill out game found message GameFound gameFound; gameFound.ID = MSG_GAME_FOUND; lstrcpynW( gameFound.GameName, gameName, 32 ); CopyMemory( gameFound.Nonce, findGame.Nonce, 8 ); // from client CopyMemory( &gameFound.KeyID, &xnHostKeyID, sizeof(XNKID) ); CopyMemory( &gameFound.Key, &xnHostKey, sizeof(XNKEY) ); CopyMemory( &gameFound.HostAddr, &xnHostAddr, sizeof(XNADDR) ); The following code shows a typical response by the host to a game discovery message. This message is sent using the same style of broadcast socket that the client used to send the discovery message. As mentioned earlier, broadcast messages are always encrypted.  // Create broadcast address using INADDR_BROADCAST SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_BROADCAST; saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); // Broadcast the message to all system link Xbox consoles INT err = sendto( sBrd, (const char*)(&gameFound),                    sizeof(gameFound), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                   sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN)); Depending on the type of game, additional information could well be included in this message, including the name of the hosting player, the number of players currently in the game, and game statistics. Connecting to a Game The client that issued the discovery request can wait up to three seconds to get the list of available hosts (system link TCR). The discovery response is received using the same style of listening socket that the host used when listening for discovery messages. Ignore messages with non-matching nonces, because they are intended for other Xbox consoles that are running the same game and also happen to be in game discovery mode. // See if any hosts have responded to game discovery GameFound gameFound; INT iBytes = recv( sLBrd, (char*)(&gameFound),                             sizeof(gameFound), 0 ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(gameFound) )    if( gameFound.ID == MSG_GAME_FOUND &&        memcmp( &gameFound.Nonce, findGame.Nonce, 8 ) == 0 )       // add the session info to the list of sessions Depending on the type of game and the number of sessions, a title may automatically select a session or present the list of sessions and allow the player to choose. Once a session has been selected, the client must register the game s session keys and translate the host XNADDR to an Internet address (IN_ADDR) that can be used to communicate directly with the host. The XNetRegisterKey() function informs the network stack to  listen  for incoming messages from other Xbox consoles that are using the same session key. INT err = XNetRegisterKey( &gameFound.KeyID, &gameFound.Key ); The XNetXnAddrToInAddr() function converts an Xbox XNADDR to an IP address that is usable by Winsock to communicate directly with that Xbox. The translation requires the session key ID. Be aware that this IN_ADDR is not a   IP address. It has the format 0.x.y.z. If an IN_ADDR is transmitted to another Xbox or a PC, the target Xbox/PC cannot use the IN_ADDR, because it is useful only in the context of the Xbox that converted the address. One way to think of the IN_ADDR is as a  handle  to the actual XNADDR. The Xbox SNL knows how to convert this handle into the XNADDR. IN_ADDR inHost; INT err = XNetXnAddrToInAddr ( &gameFound.HostAddr,                                &gameFound.KeyID, &inHost ); Now both the host and the client have registered the same session key and the client knows the host s unique Xbox address. Now the client can send messages directly to the host. No more broadcast messages are required. The port number you choose for non-broadcast messages is entirely up to the game. Any port number in the range 1 through 65535 is valid. Here s an example of how the client might issue a  join game  message to the host. struct JoinGame    BYTE ID;              // message ID    WCHAR PlayerName[32]; // name of player that wants to join // Generate the message payload JoinGame joinGame; joinGame.ID = MSG_JOIN_GAME; lstrcpynW( joinGame.PlayerName, playerName, 32 ); // Talk directly with the host SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr = inHost; // from XNetXnAddrToInAddr saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_DIRECT_PORT ); // Send message directly to host INT err = sendto( s, (const char*)(&joinGame),                    sizeof(joinGame), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                   sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN)); From this point on, all messages sent between the player and the host can be sent using standard socket calls. The Xbox SNL automatically handles the underlying key exchanges, authentication and encryption of the messages. Any message that has been tampered with or is otherwise bogus will be detected and ignored by the Secure Network Library and will never be propagated to the game. Allowing Players To Join When the host game is allowing players to join, it must listen for join messages. Join messages are sent directly from a client Xbox to the host Xbox, so the host Xbox can determine where the message originated. This allows the host to determine the XNADDR of the client. In the game loop, check to see if any join messages have been sent from other Xbox consoles. Note the use of recvfrom() to determine the source of the message. // See if any game join requests have been received. // Socket s has been bound to INADDR_ANY, GAME_DIRECT_PORT. JoinGame joinGame; SOCKADDR_IN saFrom; INT iSize = sizeof( SOCKADDR_IN ); INT iBytes = recvfrom( s, (char*)(&joinGame), sizeof(joinGame),                         0, (sockaddr*)(&saFrom), &iSize ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(joinGame) )    if( joinGame.ID == MSG_JOIN_GAME )       // handle join game message (see below) At this point, we have a valid  join game  message and we have some information about the Xbox who sent the message. Specifically, we have the IN_ADDR of the source Xbox. Again, this IP address is not a   IP address. The host can continue to use this IN_ADDR to communicate with the client Xbox for the duration of the session, but if the host wants to send this Xbox address to other Xbox consoles, the IN_ADDR must be translated to an XNADDR. To translate an IN_ADDR to an XNADDR, use XNetInAddrToXnAddr(). The last parameter of the function is the optional XNKID that can be used to retrieve the session key ID associated with the address. In this case, the host already knows the session key ID, so we pass NULL. XNADDR xnClient; INT err = XNetInAddrToXnAddr( saFrom.sin_addr, &xnClient, NULL ); s up to the title to decide how to handle join requests. If the game is already full, it will most likely issue a  join failed  response. If the join is allowed, the game will respond with a  join approved  message. It may also send additional information about the game and other players in the game. Distributing Xbox Addresses System link games can choose whatever policy they wish when it comes to player communication. The host can act as the server and all communication can happen between the host and each player (client-server model), or the host can distribute the addresses of all of the Xbox consoles participating in the game and each player can communicate directly with the other players (peer-to-peer model). To distribute Xbox addresses, the host typically sends the XNADDR of each existing player when a new player joins the game. After that, whenever a new player joins, the host sends the XNADDR of the new player to each existing player. When a game receives notification of a new player XNADDR, it translates the XNADDR to an IN_ADDR using XNetXnAddrToInAddr() and the game session key ID (XNKID). After the translation, the title can throw away the XNADDR (unless it intends to forward the address to another Xbox) and use the IN_ADDR for all future communication. Never send an IN_ADDR on the wire, because it is useless outside of the Xbox that owns it. Each Xbox must do its own translation of XNADDRs to IN_ADDRs, because each Xbox network stack has its own local table of XNADDRs / IN_ADDRs. Handling Player Disconnects Game developers that write networked PC games often assume that the way a player leaves a networked game is via the UI, which typically invokes a standard termination of sockets (for example, shutdown(), closesocket(), or WSACleanup()). On the Xbox, the ways a player will commonly leave a networked game are by turning off the Xbox or rebooting into a different game. Therefore a game should never rely on a socket getting closed to indicate that a player has left the game. There are two common methods for detecting when a player has left or a connection has been dropped. One way is to periodically send the other players an  are you there?  message (ping) and see if they respond. Another method is for every player to periodically broadcast an  m here  message (heartbeat). Each player keeps track of the other player s heartbeats, and when players don t hear a heartbeat in a fixed period of time, they assume that player left. The WinsockPeer sample in the Xbox SDK uses the heartbeat method, sending heartbeats three times per second and timing out players who haven t sent a heartbeat for two or more seconds. UDP vs. TCP The Xbox SNL supports both UDP and TCP protocols. Both protocols are always authenticated and both are encrypted by default. UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol. UDP packets may arrive out of order, and they may never arrive at all. UDP packets are smaller than TCP packets and generally exhibit better performance. Broadcast messages by definition require UDP. TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol. TCP packets are re-sent if they cannot be delivered and are guaranteed to arrive in the order they were sent. TCP packets are larger than UDP packets. For system link play, it s uncommon to see UDP packet loss or packet out-of-order issues. UDP is also a better protocol choice for performance reasons. Most multiplayer games choose UDP for these reasons, and many games create their own  reliable UDP  protocols on top of UDP. If performance is not an essential game requirement but reliable packets are key, choose TCP. XNet Library Versions There are four different versions of the Xbox SNL library, described below. In general, development work will take place using XNET.LIB or XNETD.LIB, and shipping titles will use XNETS.LIB. XNET and XNETD Developer Libraries XNETD version includes debugging information, assertions, symbols, and so on. XNET version does not have debugging enabled. Use these libraries for games in development. Allow remote debugging of the game. Allow communication with PCs and other untrusted hosts if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns the debugger IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. XNetGetTitleXnAddr() returns the title IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. XNETSD Secure Library Includes debugging information, assertions, symbols, and so on. Use this library for final debugging stages of game or security testing. Allows remote debugging of the game. Does not allow communication with untrusted machines, with the exception of the debugger, even if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns the debugger IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() is empty. XNETS Secure Libraries Use this library for shipping titles. Titles must link with this library to pass system link TCRs. Does not allow remote debugging; must use hard disk logging or other methods for debugging. Does not allow communication with PCs, even if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns XNET_GET_XNADDR_NONE. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() is empty. Communicating with Development Systems By default, an Xbox console may communicate with another Xbox console only using secure communication. All versions of the XNet libraries support secure communication between Xbox consoles. However, if you are linking with the XNet developer libraries (either XNETD.LIB or XNET.LIB), you can also communicate with  untrusted  devices, including PC development systems. To enable communication to untrusted hosts, set the XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY parameter when calling XNetStartup(). XNetStartupParams xnsp; ZeroMemory( &xnsp, sizeof(xnsp) ); xnsp.cfgSizeOfStruct = sizeof(xnsp); xnsp.cfgFlags = XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY; INT err = XNetStartup( &xnsp ); On Xbox development systems, the Xbox IP address is available on the main menu of the XDK Launcher. There are two IP addresses, because the Xbox has two network stacks. You can toggle through the addresses by pressing the Black button on the controller. The   address is the address of the debug stack. The debug stack is used by XBDM for remote debugging. Microsoft  Visual Studio  uses this IP address to communicate with the Xbox during remote debugging. The   address is the address of the title stack. The title stack is used by games for game networking. The Xbox title IP address can be retrieved programmatically by games linked with the developer library by accessing the XNADDR ina field from the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr(). The debug address can be similarly found using XNetGetDebugXnAddr(). From the PC side, an application may call DmGetAltAddress() to retrieve the title IP address for the Xbox. For more details, see the Debugger API section in the Xbox Development Kit documentation. The code shown above will compile and link successfully with the Xbox secure libraries (XNETS.LIB and XNETSD.LIB), but the XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY parameter will be ignored, and connections to untrusted hosts will fail. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() will also be empty. When linking with XNETSD.LIB, the debugging version of the secure library, only XBDM (debugger) communication is allowed to untrusted hosts. In other words, XNetGetDebugXnAddr() will return the IP address of the debug stack when linking with XNETSD.LIB, but XNetGetTitleXnAddr() will not return a valid IP address when linking with either XNETSD.LIB or XNETS.LIB. Random Number Generation For maximum security, use the XNetRandom() function whenever you need to generate nonces or other random data sent on the wire. All random keys (including XNKID/XNKEY pairs), nonces, and encryption initialization vectors created by the Xbox SNL are generated using this function. XNetRandom() uses an algorithm for generating random bits based on RFC 1750 (Randomness Recommendations for Security; see   HYPERLINK "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1750.html"  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1750.html ). Randomness is not based on predictable pseudo-random mathematical number generators. Instead, randomness is generated using a combination of random input sources, including physical sources of entropy such as hard disk seek time. This technique creates cryptographically strong random bits that prevent an adversary from guessing keys, nonces, or other generated values. Authentication All Xbox network traffic is authenticated. The authentication algorithm is a keyed message authentication code based on a one-way hash function. The hash is generated by the sender and included in each Xbox packet. The receiver generates a corresponding hash based on the incoming packet data and compares it with the hash that was sent. If the hashes don t match, the packet has been tampered with and is ignored. The Xbox SNL never propagates invalid packets to the title level. The authentication mechanism inhibits common network cheats, such as packet spoofing, buffer overruns, and other packet tampering. Encryption Broadcast packets are always encrypted. Encryption cannot be disabled for broadcast packets. Packets sent directly from one Xbox to another are encrypted by default. The encryption phase occurs prior to the authentication phase so that the hash is based on the encrypted bits. The encryption method is based on a symmetric encryption cipher. All encryption and decryption is handled automatically by the Xbox SNL. Any packet received by an Xbox that fails the decryption phase is considered invalid and never propagates to the title level. Although encryption and decryption are extremely fast (see the Secure Library Overhead and Performance section that follows), encryption may be turned off on a per-socket, per-message basis to increase performance. The setsockopt() function is used with the SO_ENCRYPT flag to change the encryption level of a socket. // Turn encryption off BOOL bEncrypt = FALSE; INT err = setsockopt( s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ENCRYPT,                       (const char*)&bEncrypt, sizeof(bEncrypt) ); // Use send or sendto to issue unsecured data . . . INT iBytes = send( s, . . . ); // Turn encryption back on bEncrypt = TRUE; err = setsockopt( s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ENCRYPT,                   (const char*)&bEncrypt, sizeof(bEncrypt) ); The encryption setting affects only the logical state of the socket, not the physical state. In this example, even if the message wasn t physically sent before encryption was turned back on, the network stack will remember that the message should be unencrypted and that the next message should be encrypted. To protect your game and your customers, we highly recommend that you always keep default encryption enabled. The only time you should consider disabling encryption is when turning off encryption provides a performance gain that significantly improves gameplay. When encryption is off, your message payloads will be completely evident to any packet sniffer. Once that data is exposed, a hacker may have all the information he needs to cheat in your game. Be aware that the following items must always be encrypted to meet TCRs: XNADDR This structure contains addressing data that would be useful to a hacker, including the Xbox Ethernet MAC address. XNKEY The session key and key ID are usually sent only via a broadcast message, which is always encrypted. However, if they are sent directly, they must be protected with encryption. XNKID Xbox Packet Format Xbox packets conform to RFC 2406 (IP Encapsulating Security Payload; see   HYPERLINK "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2406.html"  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2406.html ), with the addition of a UDP header immediately following the IP header. The general format of the packet is as follows: Description Size (bytes) Authenticated Encrypted IP header UDP header (NAT header) ESP header (security data) Encryption IV (for encrypted packets) True UDP or TCP header Message payload variable Padding ICV authentication data The outer UDP header forces all packets to use exactly one UDP source port no matter how many actual source ports the game uses. This is essential for Xbox packets to communicate through NATs, a key requirement for future Internet games. This also means that every port number in the range 1 through 65535 is available for Xbox games, because that port number is contained in the   UDP/TCP header; there are no reserved ports. The single UDP source port used by the outer header is the Xbox Game Port, 3074, registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Notice that the IP and outer UDP header are neither authenticated nor encrypted. The Xbox assumes that these fields can and will be spoofed. The Xbox uses the information in the authenticated UDP or TCP header only when reading the packet. The Encryption IV is the initialization vector (IV). The IV is random data used during the encryption process to guarantee that even if the same payload is sent more than once, it will always encrypt to different ciphertext. The ICV is the integrity check value, or the authentication hash. The size of the padding depends on the payload size. Two bytes are always required to store padding information. Unencrypted packets must have a payload size evenly divisible by four, so up to three additional bytes may be added as padding. Encrypted packets must have a payload that s divisible by eight, so up to seven additional bytes may be added. To avoid wasted space in your packets, always send a payload that is a multiple of 8 bytes (encrypted) or 4 bytes (unencrypted). The maximum UDP payload size is 1,430 bytes. The maximum TCP payload size for a single unfragmented packet is 1,418 bytes. TCP send buffers larger than 1,418 bytes are split automatically into multiple packets and reassembled automatically by the recipient. Secure Library Overhead and Performance Compared to typical UDP/TCP packets, an Xbox packet includes the additional UDP header (8 bytes), the ESP header (8 bytes), the IV for encrypted packets (8 bytes), and the ICV (12 bytes). Encrypted packets have a padding of 2 to 9 bytes. Unencrypted packets have a padding of 2 to 5 bytes. That means that unencrypted Xbox packets are 30 to 33 bytes larger than their unauthenticated PC cousins. Encrypted Xbox packets are 38 to 45 bytes larger than their unauthenticated and unencrypted PC cousins. Because the Xbox uses a broadband connection, this overhead is less significant than it would be for narrowband. The advantage is that all Xbox communication is secure. The authentication and encryption algorithms were chosen not only for their security but also for their performance characteristics. Sending a 1-KB payload with the Xbox SNL takes approximately 0.00012 seconds. That includes the time to allocate the packet, fill it in, compute normal UDP and IP checksums, encrypt the payload, compute the hash, and transmit the packet. With encryption disabled, sending a 1-KB payload requires one-third of that time (40 microseconds). The time overhead is linear based on packet size. Transmit and receive performance can be roughly computed as: x = payload size in bytes t = (10-8)x + 16-6 = transmission/receive time in seconds For example, sending a 512-byte encrypted payload takes approximately t = (10-8)(512) + 16-6 = 51.2-6 + 16-6  ranging in size from 32 bytes to 1 KB, assuming those payloads are sent 20 times per second. Payload size (bytes) Encrypted and Authenticated Authenticated only 0.04% 0.02% 0.04% 0.03% 0.05% 0.03% 0.08% 0.04% 0.13% 0.05% 1,024 0.23% 0.08% These results show that even when sending 20 KB of encrypted and authenticated data per second, CPU usage is less than a quarter of 1 percent! The results for receiving data are almost exactly the same. Because the performance of the secure library is so good, encryption is enabled by default. Performance can be improved by turning off encryption, but only at the price of less secure data. Note   This data was obtained on a DVT3 Xbox Development Kit running build 3704 (retail) using the XNETS.LIB secure retail version of the Xbox SNL. Although these numbers may vary slightly in the final consumer box, they are close estimates to what can be expected in production. Key Exchange For secure communication to take place between two Xbox consoles, the consoles must agree on the keys used to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate packets. When a title sends the first packet to an IP address obtained by the call to XNetXnAddrToInAddr(), the Xbox network stack detects that no security association is established between the game client and destination Xbox. At this point, the two Xbox consoles transparently and automatically engage in a key exchange transaction. In the examples shown above, this key exchange transaction happens whenever a client sends the  join game  message directly to the game host. Xbox key exchange uses a secure key exchange algorithm that requires significant CPU time. Approximately 13 milliseconds are required to compute keys. Both the host and client perform this computation. This performance characteristic may improve in future versions of the library. In the meantime, be aware of the potential performance impact, particularly for games that support  join in progress. How the Xbox Prevents Common Hacker Attacks The Xbox SNL is designed to prevent many common network cheats and hacker attacks. By handling these attacks within the network stack itself, the Xbox insulates network games from having to individually deal with these issues. It also ensures that network performance is maximized, because bad packets can be detected and ignored at a low level. The following table describes common game cheats and how the Xbox inhibits that cheat. Cheat Xbox Detection/Prevention Packet sniffing All broadcast packets are encrypted. Other packets are encrypted by default, so the packet format is concealed. Only the packet format of unencrypted packets is visible. Keep this in mind if you choose to disable encryption your payload will be visible to sniffers. Packet tampering The true TCP/UDP portion of the Xbox packet and the payload is always authenticated. It is also encrypted by default. Modifications to the packet cause the packet to fail authentication. Invalid packets are ignored by the Xbox SNL. Packet spoofing In a shipping game, an Xbox can send data only to other Xbox consoles and can receive data only from other Xbox consoles. Packets sent from a PC masquerading as an Xbox will be ignored, because a PC does not have the data required to emulate an Xbox. Buffer overruns Generating a buffer overrun requires a hacker to modify a packet so that it contains (or seems to contain) more data than the receiver expects. A modified packet will fail authentication and will be ignored. Replay attacks Xbox packets contain time-stamp values. The time stamp is authenticated, so any changes to the time stamp will cause the packet to fail authentication. If an unchanged packet is re-sent, the destination Xbox will detect that the time stamp is out of range and the packet will be ignored. Denial of service The first line of denial of service defense is the ESP header portion of the Xbox packet. It contains security parameters and sequencing data that are checked before any other items in the packet. A flooder program would have difficulty replicating this data. The ESP can be checked without performing the hash authentication, so it s a very fast check. The second line of defense is the authentication itself. Although a flooding program could force the Xbox to authenticate packets, authentication is so fast that the flooding program would have to have very high throughput to adversely affect a game.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Xbox Best Storage Practices TitleXbox Best Storage Practices Pete Isensee Normal.dot Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceType urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceNameXbox file system is a thin API that provides rapid access to the Xbox hard disk, DVD disc, and memory units (MUs). PC file systems typically have a high system overhead, using many megabytes of memory for file caching and other optimizations. The Xbox file system does not impose this overhead; it has a very low memory footprint. The tradeoff is that the Xbox file system has limitations and performance hurdles that are critical for game developers to understand. The following list documents Xbox game storage conventions that provide maximum performance and show how best to take advantage of the Xbox file system. Read and Write Data in Large Blocks The following table shows the optimum minimum buffer sizes for reading and writing to Xbox storage devices. For best performance, use the buffer size shown (or a larger buffer), when calling ReadFile() and WriteFile(). For instance, when reading from the Xbox hard disk, pass at least 32,768 bytes (32 KB) in the dwBytesToRead parameter of ReadFile(). Device Optimum Minimum Buffer Size Write Hard disk 32 KB 16 KB Memory unit 64 KB 16 KB Disc drive 16 KB Read and Write Sequentially Sequential input/output (I/O) is faster than random I/O. Because the default Xbox file cache is small, random reads and writes usually require physically accessing storage. Sequential I/O can take advantage of the file cache much more often than random I/O. If you must perform random I/O, increase the file cache size temporarily using XSetFileCacheSize(). t Read (or Write) the Same Place Twice Reading the same file location twice may require physically accessing the storage device twice, due to the small size of the Xbox file cache. Save the data in memory to avoid having to re-read it from storage. Preset the File Size The Xbox can improve file write times if the file size of a new file is known in advance. To presize a file, use the SetEndOfFile() function in combination with the SetFilePointer() function. Avoid Small Files Small files have a high overhead because each file requires a minimum of one cluster of physical space. The size of cluster is available via the XGetDiskClusterSize() function. At the time of this writing, the Xbox hard disk and memory unit cluster size is 16 KB. That means a 1-KB file would waste 15 KB of disk space. Games with small files typically have a large number of files, which also adversely affects performance (see next section). Limit the Number of Files in a Directory The maximum number of files and subdirectories per directory is 4,096. However, any directory with more than 768 files is going to give slower file access than a directory with 768 files or less, due to the technique that the Xbox file system uses to store directory listings. Additionally, directories are not sorted, so it requires an O(n) search to find and open a file. The more files in a directory, the longer it takes to open a file in that directory. Especially avoid storing many files on the root directory of a partition, for example, on T:\ (persistent data region) or Z:\ (utility region). For better performance, store files in a subdirectory. If you must store many files, increase the file cache size using XSetFileCacheSize(). Increase the File Cache During Disk Operations The default file cache size on Xbox is 64 KB. For comparison, the file cache size for Microsoft  Windows  2000 on a 64-MB machine can range from 10 to 20+ MB! Temporarily boosting the size of the Xbox file cache during heavy disk I/O can improve performance dramatically. Even file creation and deletion times are significantly reduced when the cache size is enlarged. To get and set the cache size, use the XGetFileCacheSize() and XSetFileCacheSize() functions. Be aware that changing the cache size changes the memory footprint of your game. Limit the Number of Files Per Saved Game We recommend using a single save game data file for optimal read and write times, especially if your game allows saves on memory units and saved games are large (>1 MB). Calculate Storage Sizes Correctly Like most file systems, Xbox file systems have a minimum allocation size for files. This minimum size is called a cluster. The size of a cluster depends on the device and is given by the XGetDiskClusterSize() function. A 1-byte file occupies one physical cluster. A file with XGetDiskClusterSize() + 1 bytes occupies two clusters. Use the following formula to determine the number of bytes physically used by a file:     DWORD dwClusterSize = XGetDiskClusterSize( . . . );     DWORD dwClusters = ( dwBytes + (dwClusterSize-1) ) /                           dwClusterSize; Use the XGetDisplayBlocks() function to calculate the size of directories, including the size of all subdirectories. A block is 16 KB. Calculate Save Game Size Correctly Saved games always include three components: The saved game directory (one cluster) SaveMeta.xbx meta file (one cluster) The saved game data (game dependent) Saved games that include a save game image also include SaveImage.xbx (one cluster). When calculating how much storage space will be required to save a game, be sure to include all components. Display Storage Sizes Correctly To meet Technical Certification Requirements, game UI must display storage sizes in terms of  blocks.  A block is 16 KB. To determine the number of blocks in use by a given directory and all of its subdirectories, use the XGetDisplayBlocks() function. This function recursively calculates the number of blocks occupied by all of the files and subdirectories in the given directory. Use the Enum/Open Optimization The Xbox has a unique optimization that speeds up opening a list of files. Information on the last file returned by the FindFile() family of functions is cached by the file system. CreateFile() checks for this   when it opens a file. If CreateFile() is opening the same file that was just enumerated, it can immediately open the file rather than searching for it internally. On the Xbox hard disk, this technique can buy as much as a 5  improvement over enumerating the files and then opening them later. On an Xbox MU, the improvement is approximately 3 Understand Storage Device Performance Specs Peak Xbox hard disk throughput is 20 MB per second for both reading and writing. Peak Xbox memory unit throughput is about 750 KB per second for reading and 500 KB per second for writing. Peak DVD throughput is 6.5 MB per second. Hard disk seek time averages around 10 milliseconds. Seeking across the game DVD is an order of magnitude slower than seeking across the hard disk. Use Asynchronous File Operations Normally, ReadFile() and WriteFile() block until the entire read or write operation has completed. This bottleneck can cause a game to hang noticeably during large reads and writes. Asynchronous file I/O allows the system to notify you when a read or write is complete. That allows you do other work, like rendering graphics and audio, while a file is being read or written. A file is opened for asynchronous I/O by passing the flags FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING to CreateFile(). Files opened for asynchronous I/O have limitations on valid file buffer sizes and file offsets. There are two types of notification methods to choose from: callbacks and event objects. For additional information, see the XDK documentation on CreateFile(). Use the CreateFile() Optimization Flags When opening a file with CreateFile(), use FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS to indicate that the file will typically be read/written in a non-sequential fashion. Use FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN to indicate that the file will typically be read/written in a sequential fashion. The Xbox file system uses these flags to adjust its file caching techniques. If you specify neither flag, FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN is assumed. For more details, see the XDK documentation on CreateFile(). Use the Xbox Native APIs Both standard C and standard C++ file I/O routines (for example, fopen(), fread(), and iostreams) are supported on the Xbox. Keep in mind that these routines are wrappers on top of the Xbox file system API and may impose performance penalties on your game. On the other hand, these libraries may also give improved performance because they provide their own file caching at the expense of additional memory overhead. If you choose to use these libraries, be aware of potential performance issues. The Xbox APIs expose optimization techniques, including optimization flags and asynchronous file operations, that are not provided by the standard C or C++ file functions. Use the XCalculateSignature API for Security There is a family of XCalculateSignature() functions than can be used to authenticate content and other data written to the hard disk. You must use these functions to sign saved games to meet Xbox Technical Certification Requirements. These routines can also be useful for any data that you want to protect from hackers or simply want to verify at run time. The signature function calculates a one-way hash, similar to a checksum, that can be stored with the data. When the data is read, the existing hash can be compared to a fresh hash of the data. If there s a match, you know the data is valid. If not, the data is corrupt.  The signature functions also allow you to sign files so that they re locked to a particular Xbox. If those files are transported to another Xbox, the hash comparison will fail. The hashing algorithm has good performance characteristics, so it can be used on large files without significant penalty.  Check for File API Failures Any function that returns a handle (for example, CreateFile(), FindFirstFile(), and XCalculateSignatureBegin()) allocates system memory and should be checked for failure, which typically indicates a low memory condition. Any function that accesses physical storage (for example, ReadFile() and WriteFile()) should be checked for errors, particularly functions that access Xbox memory units. If an MU is pulled from the controller during a file function, that function will report the error condition. Failure to check for file I/O errors can result in a game thinking that it has read or written data successfully when, in fact, the file access failed. Another example of a function that should always be checked for errors is XCreateSaveGame(). It will return failure codes when there are already 4,096 saved games (the maximum) on the device or in the rare situations in which the save game directory cannot be created. Check for Memory Unit Mount Failures The function XMountMU() is used to prepare an Xbox Memory Unit for future file I/O. It can return a variety of error codes that must be handled properly: Error (ERROR_ ...) Condition SUCCESS The MU was mounted successfully. DISK_FULL Mount failed. The MU is full of data (saved games) from other titles and contains no free space. Display MU, but do not allow MU to be selected. ALREADY_ASSIGNED Mount failed. The MU has already been mounted. All calls to XMountMU() must be matched with an XUnmountMU(). DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED Mount failed. The MU was removed from the controller during the XMountMU call. OUTOFMEMORY Mount failed. Memory could not be allocated to mount the MU. Display MU, but do not allow MU to be selected. UNRECOGNIZED_VOLUME Mount failed. The MU is damaged and should be reformatted in the Dashboard. Display MU, but do not allow MU to be selected. Other file system errors Mount failed. System files on the MU failed to be read. The MU is damaged and should be reformatted in the Dashboard. Display MU, but do not allow MU to be selected. Use Compression to Minimize I/O For games that are not CPU bound, I/O performance can be improved by using lossless compression techniques for storing data. Standard lossless algorithms often provide 2:1 or 3:1 compression ratios depending on the type of data, producing smaller files that require less time to read and write. The tradeoff is that a game will spend CPU time decompressing (and/or compressing) data, but in many cases the trade-off is well worth the I/O time saved.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Xbox Transform and Lighting Performance TitleXbox Transform and Lighting Performance mikeab Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0Xbox Transform and Lighting Data Flow Last night, my daughter asked me if I could take her to Borders to get a Connie Willis book. One of the longest-standing rules in our house is that reading is good, and any book she wants we ll get for her, so we set off for the store. Now, I knew that Christmas was only four days away, but I hadn t really considered the implications, which turned out to be dire, to say the least. The line from the cash registers stretched back past Literature and History all the way into Social Sciences more than 100 feet in all. They had all the cash registers going, but unfortunately that only amounted to four or five all told. So my daughter picked out her book, then browsed around the store while I waited in line. And waited. And waited. At least I got to read the first part of her book, which wasn t bad. And so we learn something about bottlenecks. All the books in the world wouldn t have enabled Borders to handle any more customers, but one more register would have made a huge difference. The secret to performance is putting resources in the right place to ease the bottlenecks which is a very appropriate way to kick off a discussion of data flow through the T&L pipeline. The T&L pipeline bristles with potential bottlenecks and also with caches that, properly applied, shrink those bottlenecks almost magically. And with that, onward to T&L pipeline data flow and a variety of associated performance issues! The T&L pipeline The graphics pipeline in the Xbox part of the pipeline and performance issues associated with that data flow. One interesting aspect of this discussion is why tristrips are generally a better performance choice than trilists, even in the case where trilists are organized to draw vertices in the same order as tristrips. Before we begin, I d like to point out that the information in this paper is a best-effort description based on the design of the Xbox GPU, but since the final hardware doesn t yet exist, the information is subject to change. Functionally, the T&L part of the pipeline looks like this: Viewed this way, the T&L pipeline is pretty simple. Vertices are fetched from memory, transformed and lit by either the programmable or the fixed-function vertex shader, and then assembled into triangles for rasterization. Of course, there s plenty of potential complication in how the programmable vertex shader is programmed or how the fixed-function vertex shader is configured, but those are discussed elsewhere; here we re going to treat the vertex shader as just a black box that accepts a raw object-space vertex and emits a transformed and lit vertex. The problem with the straightforward view of the pipeline diagrammed above is performance. It s expensive to fetch vertices from memory; at a 200-MHz memory clock, a vertex takes a minimum of 10 ns to fetch, and can easily take much more depending on page locality and contention with other bus masters. Considering that tens of millions of triangles can be drawn per second, vertex fetching can easily be a limiting performance factor. Depending on the vertex shader in effect, it can be even more expensive to shade vertices than to fetch them often considerably more. A vertex shader program can take up to 64 GPU clocks 256 ns at a 250-MHz GPU clock to run, and while that s an extreme case, just a few lights and a few textures can quickly add up to 10 to 20 clocks (40-80 ns) or more, and even one infinite light and two textures is 6 clocks (24 ns). As it happens, each vertex is often used multiple times; in fact, each vertex can be used in as many as six different triangles, on average, depending on mesh layout. This means that there is considerable opportunity to improve performance via caching. The T&L pipeline sports not one but three caches for this very purpose, as follows: Each stage up to the primitive-assembly cache processes one vertex at a time, but the primitive-assembly cache gathers up the three vertices of each triangle to be drawn, and then outputs them as a set to the rasterization part of the pipeline. (That s not quite how the hardware internals work, but conceptually it s individual vertices that travel through the T&L pipeline up to the primitive-assembly cache, and triangles defined by three vertices that travel from the primitive-assembly cache to triangle setup.) Note that the T&L pipeline (the whole GPU pipeline, for that matter) is highly pipelined (no pun intended) that is, the various units in the pipeline coprocess in parallel. Thus, the latency of the pipeline the time a single vertex or triangle takes to get from one end to the other is the sum of the times taken by the various units (memory fetching, vertex shading, triangle setup, etc.), but the throughput of the pipeline the rate at which it can process vertices and triangles is determined by the slowest unit only. In other words, the effective performance of the pipeline is not additive, but rather determined by a max() function of the performance of the various units. Thus, if triangle setup takes 2 clocks and a 2-clock vertex shader is in use, one tristrip triangle can be processed every 2 clocks, not every 4. You might think that this sophisticated caching means that data flow through the T&L pipeline is automatically optimized, so programmers don t have to worry about this aspect of performance, but it turns out that quite the opposite is true. To a much greater extent than a CPU cache, the effectiveness of the T&L pipeline caches is highly dependent on data layout and organization. Consequently, you must take considerable care in assembling meshes in order to get the best performance out of the T&L pipeline. Microsoft has developed mesh optimization code (provided in the XDK) that does a good job of optimizing meshes for the T&L caches, and we suggest you use that code, or at least start with it (source is included). Nonetheless, next we ll discuss the detailed care and feeding of the T&L caches, for several reasons: to help you understand what the mesh optimizer does and the best sorts of meshes to feed it; to enable you to optimize meshes on your own or enhance the Microsoft mesh optimizer, should that be necessary; and to help you understand the performance of your meshes. Vertex fetching from memory The T&L performance story starts when a vertex gets fetched from memory. The first factor that affects performance is how much memory has to be fetched less is better. Thus, minimizing vertex size via vertex compression and vertex shader attribute generation (such as texgen) is a good idea (although you ll have to weigh the extra clocks required for complex vertex shaders against the gain from fetching fewer bytes). One thing that actually doesn t automatically help reduce memory fetches, although you might think that it would, is the use of indexed primitives. While these do have smaller footprints than equivalent non-indexed vertex streams, because only one instance of each vertex is needed, without caching they would still require just as many vertex fetches as non-index primitives, with each vertex being fetched from memory every time its index came up. Even with caching, poor index ordering can result in each vertex being fetched up to six times on average. In fact, because of the extra memory accesses required to fetch the indices, in the worst case, an indexed primitive can actually require more bandwidth than a non-indexed primitive. So while indexed primitives can indeed reduce memory fetching a great deal, because they make it possible to load each vertex only once, they do so only when used properly, as discussed below. The next factor that affects performance is whether the vertex is in an open page. (See  Xbox Memory Architecture  for a discussion of memory performance and pages.) As you d expect, page hits are much faster than page misses, so you should try to group your vertices and order your indices so that page boundaries are crossed as infrequently as possible. Ideally, of course, vertex fetching would proceed sequentially through memory. This seems impossible, because each vertex is typically needed for several triangles; as we ll see shortly, however, the pre-T&L cache, by eliminating the need to refetch most vertices, makes it possible to approach the ideal of sequential fetching. Note that page locality is not an issue for non-indexed primitives; since they re read sequentially, their page locality is excellent. Unfortunately, that locality comes at the expense of a much larger memory footprint and of much poorer caching without indices, tristrips can t share vertices between more than three triangles and trilists can t share vertices between triangles at all. This means that indexed primitives are mandatory for high performance. Finally, there s the question of whether any particular vertex sizes and alignments are best. As it turns out, this is only an issue for accesses that jump around memory a lot; sequential accesses, or accesses with good locality, will require only a minimum number of memory accesses regardless of vertex size and alignment, thanks to the pre-T&L cache (discussed below). If your vertex fetches do skip around memory (which we strongly recommend you avoid if at all possible), you will get better results if you can squeeze your vertices down to the next power-of-two, and align them correspondingly, to maximize the efficiency of the pre-T&L cache (and, of course, shrinking vertices helps reduce bandwidth, as well). One other handy trick is that if your vertices have components that aren t used most of the time (like a second set of texture coordinates that are used only when there s damage to show, or for special effects), you can place them in a separate input stream, so they don t waste bandwidth when they re not needed. So the takeaways here are: keep your vertices small, use indexed primitives, and keep successive vertex fetches close together preferably sequential in memory in order to minimize page misses.  The pre-T&L cache The pre-T&L cache is a standard memory cache, similar to a CPU cache except that it only handles reads, not writes. It s 4 KB, 4-way set associative, with 128 32-B cache lines. This cache is why vertex size and alignment aren t important (apart from the normal bandwidth considerations associated with size) if the vertices are fetched sequentially or with good locality; in such cases, the pre-T&L cache simply retains any excess bytes fetched along with any one vertex for the short time until they re needed by another vertex, so no extra memory accesses are needed, even for vertices that span cache-line boundaries. The pre-T&L cache makes it possible to lay out indices and meshes so that actual memory requests for vertices are nearly sequential. In other words, if your indices go like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 6 1, 3, and 5 will be in the pre-T&L cache the second time they re used, so the actual set of requests to memory will be sequential: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Note that this is not a particularly large cache; if 32-B vertices are used, for example, a maximum of 128 vertices can be cached (and quite possibly considerably fewer, depending on how the layout of the vertices in memory maps to the cache lines). Therefore, despite the undeniable benefits of the pre-T&L cache, vertex ordering in memory and the order in which indices are used should still be structured to minimize the extent to which vertex fetching jumps around memory, and to maximize locality. The pre-T&L cache is a straight memory cache and has no knowledge of renderstate changes or starting and stopping of primitives. Therefore it persists between primitives and across state changes. In fact, it persists across everything; it doesn t even know when main memory has changed underneath it, so cache lines can be stale if this happens. To avoid it, the driver must invalidate the entire pre-T&L cache whenever such a possibility exists. Thus, the pre-T&L cache is invalidated each time a vertex buffer is unlocked. This is a good argument in favor of switching between vertex buffers and changing the contents of any given vertex buffer as infrequently as possible. It is certainly the case that if you use a vertex buffer, then change even one vertex in that buffer, and draw some more, the entire pre-T&L cache will have to be flushed. Note that only cache lines containing data that is actually used by the shader are fetched. Thus, if you have 64-B vertices, aligned to 64-B boundaries, but the shader uses only the position stored in the first 12 B of each vertex, only one 32-B cache line will be fetched per vertex. This is in contrast to the two cache lines that would be fetched if the shader also used, say, texture coordinates stored in the last 8 B of the vertex, or, of course, if the shader used all 64 B. The vertex shaders As mentioned above, this paper will treat both the programmable vertex shader and the fixed-function vertex shader as black boxes that take in raw vertex data from memory and emit transformed and lit vertices, complete with all attributes needed for rasterization. However, it is worth keeping in mind that the number of clocks a shader takes can vary by as much as ten times or more, so the way in which the vertex shader is set up can greatly affect the relative performance balance between the front end of the T&L pipeline memory fetching and the pre-T&L cache and the later parts of the pipeline, which we ll discuss next. With a slow vertex shader say a 40-instruction shader program that handles several lights and some texcoord generation, and takes 20 clocks (80 ns) memory fetch time is a relatively minor part of performance, since even a page miss every vertex wouldn t take as long as 80 ns. (Note, however, that since vertex fetching can steal bandwidth from other memory clients, it s a good idea to minimize vertex-fetching cost via effective pre-T&L caching even with a slow vertex shader.) With a fast vertex shader, though and they can get as fast as 2 clocks (8 ns) efficient vertex fetching just is as critical to maximizing performance as post-T&L processing. This can be useful to keep in mind when analyzing mesh rendering performance. One note on vertex shader performance: there are actually two programmable vertex-shading units in the GPU, each capable of executing one instruction per clock at 250 MHz. The units run in parallel, so the effective throughput of the programmable vertex shader is two instructions per clock, or one-half clock per instruction. The fixed-function vertex shader is organized quite a bit differently from the programmable vertex shader, consisting of two transform units, together with one lighting unit. It does not use any of the programmable vertex shader s instruction memory (with the sole exception of FVF_XYZRHW, which uses the first D3DVS_XBOX_RESERVEDXYZRHWSLOTS slots of instruction memory), although it does use some of the negative-index constant registers. The transform units can overlap with the lighting unit. Together, the two transform units produce transformed data at just about the rate that the single lighting unit (which has considerable internal parallelism) can process transformed data. Thus the fixed-function and programmable vertex shaders can exhibit considerably different levels of performance for the same tasks. The shaders will be discussed in detail in another paper. The post-T&L cache The pre-T&L cache is important because it can save memory accesses. The post-T&L cache goes one step better, caching all the work involved in preparing a vertex, including not only memory accesses but also vertex shading. However and it s a big however it can do this only if meshes are organized to allow it to. Let s take a look at how the post-T&L cache works, and then we can talk about how to keep it running at peak efficiency. The post-T&L cache is a 24-entry FIFO, where each entry stores one transformed-and-lit vertex in its entirety, with caching keyed off the index of the vertex. (In truth, the number of entries that are actually available varies dynamically and is considerably less than 24, except under circumstances that are unlikely to occur in real meshes, as discussed below.) Thus, as each new vertex is emitted from the vertex shader, it s placed at the head of the post-T&L cache, and the oldest entry in the cache is evicted. (It s guaranteed that any vertex coming out of the vertex shader isn t already in the post-T&L cache, because if it were, there d be no need to shade it.) Note that any of the entries in the post-T&L cache can be read from the cache at any time; it s only with respect to eviction that the cache is organized in FIFO order. s important to note that because the cache is a FIFO,  oldest  means  the entry that entered the cache longest ago,  not  the entry that was least recently used.  Instead of LRU, you could think of this as LRA least recently added. A vertex is evicted from the cache only when a new vertex needs to be added and there is no vertex that has been in the cache longer. Put another way, each vertex goes into the post-T&L cache from the vertex shader, then proceeds through it in lockstep with its neighbors, and is eventually expelled at the other end, never changing position relative to the other denizens of the cache as it moves. s a conceptual diagram of the state of the post-T&L cache after a trilist has been drawn with the sequence: 0, 16, 1, 17, 2, 18, 3, 19, 4, 20, 5, 21, 6, 22, 7, 23, 8, 24, 9, 25, 10, 26, 11, 27 and as a trilist is then drawn with vertices 5, 25, 12; vertices 5 and 25 are already cached, so vertex 12 is emitted by the vertex shader as the next vertex in the tristrip. The index numbers show the indices that are stored in the 16 cache locations before vertex 12 is added. (I m assuming the cache is effectively 16 vertices in size for this example; the actual size could vary between roughly 14 and 18, but 16 is a good rule-of-thumb size to use in general.) The arrows show how the indices move as vertex 12 is added. Index 4 is overwritten by index 20, thereby being evicted from the cache. (The cache doesn t actually work by copying data around, but conceptually this model is equivalent, and it s easier to diagram.) After the post-T&L cache has been updated with vertex 12, here s the state of the cache, with the three vertices of the current triangle being read out and sent to the primitive-assembly cache and thence to triangle setup: The important point here is that you understand that vertices are evicted from the post-T&L cache in FIFO order, but any vertex in the cache can be read out at any time. It behooves us to organize meshes so that as many reuses as possible are made of each vertex during its trip through the gullet of the post-T&L cache, because each of those reuses has a total memory fetch and shading cost of exactly zero. In other words, every time you manage to get a hit in the vertex cache, you ve gotten a free pass around all the costs of the pipeline up through the vertex shader. With memory fetches taking 10 ns and up, and vertex shading taking 8 to 80 ns or even more, the post-T&L cache offers the promise of tremendous speedups. The key to the effectiveness of the post-T&L cache, of course, is that vertices must be heavily shared between triangles. Thus, it would be disastrous for performance if every triangle used three unique indices (that is, indices that no other triangle in the mesh uses). On average, as many as six triangles can share each vertex, and the closer your meshes come to that, the better. (A given vertex can of course be shared by more triangles, but six is the limit averaged over an entire mesh.) However, while shared vertices are necessary, they are not sufficient. Each vertex must not only be shared, but must be shared in sufficiently close proximity to its initial use so that it s still in the FIFO when later triangles come along to use it. To put it another way, it s not enough to share a vertex between triangles; it also has to be shared so that it s still in the post-T&L cache when it s reused. Otherwise, all the shading work has to be done again, just as if it weren t a shared vertex, and, if the vertex has fallen out of the pre-T&L cache, all the memory fetching work has to be repeated as well. For a detailed discussion of these issues in the context of the GeForce (which has similar T&L data flow, although different memory and pipeline timings), see the paper  Xbox Vertex Performance,  which also discusses some mesh topologies that yield efficient post-T&L caching. See also the BenchMark sample program, which is designed for efficient post-T&L caching. Assuming your vertices are heavily shared, how do you go about making sure they re shared while in the post-T&L cache? Given the size of the post-T&L cache, it s actually easy to figure out if a vertex is going to be in the post-T&L cache when it s reused; just count how many uncached (by the post-T&L cache) vertices are used between the time when the vertex was last loaded into the post-T&L cache and the reuse, and see if that s more or less than the size of the FIFO. (Remember, it s a FIFO, not LRU, so you have to look for the last time the vertex was shaded and placed at the head of the cache, not just the last time the vertex was used.) If it s less, the vertex is cached; if it s more, it s not. It s easy to write a short program that can analyze meshes this way. In fact, that s what the Microsoft mesh optimizer code in the XDK does; if you re still puzzled about how post-T&L cache analysis works, I suggest you take a look at the source code. How big is that cache? As I mentioned, however, there s a complication to optimizing for the post-T&L cache: the effective size of the FIFO is much less than 24, varying between roughly 14 and 18 and not only does the effective size vary, but the exact size at any time is far too complicated and dynamic a function of the internal hardware state for there to be any possibility of writing up a usable set of rules. There s one important tip that I ll give you next, but apart from that, the only way to find out how big the vertex cache effectively is for a given combination of mesh and renderstates is to run it and see. The good news is that the effective size of the post-T&L cache is deterministic for any particular combination of mesh and renderstates, so you should be able to run your meshes and renderstates through a testing tool and optimize your meshes  use of the post-T&L cache. Unfortunately, no tool currently exists to do this, but we will try to make one available soon. In order to discuss the tip referred to above, we must first understand why the post-T&L cache s size varies dynamically. The place to start is by pointing out two related facts: (a) due to the way the pipeline is designed, the vertex shader is not allowed to start processing a vertex until storage for the shaded result is available, and (b) the only storage available for vertex shader output is at the head of the post-T&L cache. The way the T&L pipeline works is that the primitive-assembly cache (which consumes the output of the vertex shader via the post-T&L cache and feeds triangle setup) gets priority on claiming post-T&L entries. Thus, if a vertex in the post-T&L cache is reused for a triangle, it s locked down and can t serve as a destination for vertex-shader output at that time. Whether this is a performance problem depends on where in the FIFO the entry is. Because the cache is a FIFO, no entry between the oldest entry being reused (and hence locked) and the head of the cache (the newest entry) can be evicted. Therefore, if you lock down the oldest entry in the post-T&L cache (and here I m talking about the twenty-fourth entry) by reusing it, no entries can be freed up, and the vertex shader will come to a screeching halt. Now, as it happens, for efficiency the shader processes vertices in batches of six at a time, so not one but a minimum of six entries in the post-T&L cache must be available, or else the vertex shader stalls and because it s highly parallelized, all six vertices stall together. (They don t necessarily all stall instantly if fewer than six entries are available, but eventually all six vertices will stall unless there s room for them in the post-T&L cache.) There are also often up to four additional vertices in various states of transit between the vertex shader and the post-T&L cache, and while having available destinations for those vertices as well isn t as critical as the basic six, it can still affect performance, so ideally six to ten entries should be available in the post-T&L cache. Six is the magic number, though. Thus, if you get a cache hit on any of the last six entries in the post-T&L cache, it s generally worse than missing the post-T&L cache and requiring reshading, because it stalls the shading of multiple vertices. In other words, it s usually a significant net loss to get a post-T&L cache hit at the cost of stalling the vertex shader. The bottom line is that optimizing for the post-T&L cache isn t just a matter of only having 14 or 18 cache entries available. It would be simpler if that were the case, but unfortunately you can get cache hits on all 24 entries, introducing an unusual optimization hazard performance-degrading caching. The performance tip, then, is that you should make every effort not to reuse the oldest 6 to 10 entries of the 24 total in the post-T&L cache, at the risk of stalling the vertex shader and decimating performance. Actually, it s not inconceivable that there s some circumstance in which it s actually worth stalling the vertex shader to get post-T&L cache hits; again, the best way to optimize post-T&L caching is by running dynamic tuning tests on the actual Xbox hardware. Notes on the post-T&L cache s worth noting that tristrips automatically organize vertices so as to get a large part of the benefit of the post-T&L cache. That is, each vertex can be used up to six times on average, and a tristrip automatically uses each vertex three times in the space of three triangles, so with tristrips each vertex at worst gets fetched and shaded only twice, rather than the trilist worst-case of six times. In truth, tristrips use the primitive-assembly cache, discussed next, rather than the post-T&L cache, to accomplish this, but that doesn t change the basic point that tristrips eliminate a lot of the post-T&L-oriented mesh optimization that has to be done with trilists. It also doesn t change the fact that it s still important with tristrips to optimize meshes so that the post-T&L cache can eliminate that one remaining potential refetch and reshade case for as many vertices as possible. The priming example below shows how it s possible to use the post-T&L cache to eliminate every single redundant fetch and shade in a mesh that s 30 triangles across; in other words, it s possible even in the case of a 30-wide, infinitely-long mesh to fetch and shade each vertex exactly once the theoretical minimum. Most meshes won t be quite so amenable to optimization, but it s possible to come surprisingly close to ideal vertex processing by deft use of the post-T&L cache. One handy feature of the post-T&L cache is that it persists between primitives. In other words, if you draw a tristrip, and then immediately, without changing any renderstates, draw another primitive, for example a trilist, any vertices left in the post-T&L cache at the end of the first primitive are available to the second tristrip. Another interesting aspect of the post-T&L cache is that it is possible to preload it (and the pre-T&L cache as well, as a side effect), via PrimeVertexCache(). This function issues vertices outside the scope of any primitive, and has no effect other than to cause those vertices to be loaded into the pre-T&L cache, processed by the vertex shader, and loaded into the post-T&L cache. This is useful for initializing the contents of the post-T&L cache in order to take best advantage of the post-T&L cache s FIFO eviction order. For example, consider the following tristrip: Normal tristrip drawing won t result in optimal post-T&L caching in this case. Consider the drawing order: 0, 16, 1, 17, 2, 18, 3, 19,  , 14, 30, 15, 31 At this point, degenerate triangles (as discussed below) can be used to move up to the next row of triangles, but there s no way that all the vertices along the middle will still be in the post-T&L cache as the top row is drawn, because at this point vertices 16 through 23 have already been evicted. Thus many vertices will have to be refetched and retransformed, at a considerable cost in performance. The problem here is that vertices from the bottom edge are taking up space in the post-T&L cache, even though they ll never be used again; here s the state of the cache at this point: 8, 24, 9, 25, 10, 26, 11, 27, 12, 28, 13, 29, 14, 30, 15, 31 (This assumes the cache really is 16 entries in size; it s may actually be effectively anywhere between 14 and 18, as mentioned above, but 16 is fine for illustration.) If we could somehow get the vertices from the bottom edge to be evicted from the post-T&L cache before any of the middle vertices, we d be a lot better off and that s what PrimeVertexCache() lets us do. Suppose we first prime the post-T&L cache with the following vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3,  , 13, 14, 15 The primed vertices the entire bottom edge will be the first ones evicted from the cache. Now, after we draw the bottom row of triangles with a normal tristrip: 0, 16, 1, 17, 2, 18, 3, 19,  , 14, 30, 15, 31 the contents of the vertex cache, from oldest to newest, will be: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 The key here is that all the middle vertices are in the cache, and all the bottom vertices have either been evicted or are next in line to be tossed out. Now when we draw the top row of triangles as follows: 16, 32, 17, 33, 18, 34, 19, 35,  , 28, 44, 29, 45, 30, 46, 31, 47 all the middle vertices are in the post-T&L cache, no refetching or reshading is required, and maximum performance is achieved. Priming the cache isn t free. Primed vertices take no longer to fetch and shade than they would in a normal tristrip without priming, but overlap with triangle setup and rasterization is lost, since no setup or rasterization occurs during priming. On the other hand, by improving post-T&L caching, priming saves a lot of reshading, and potentially some refetching as well. Whether it s worth doing depends on mesh size and topology, as well as how expensive vertex shading is and how the rasterization pipeline is configured, but it s certainly well worth considering. The primitive-assembly cache Triangle setup, which sets up the rasterization parameters for each triangle drawn, is the objective of all the vertex processing that we ve discussed so far. The triangle-setup unit takes just 2 clocks per triangle under all circumstances, making it possible for the Xbox GPU to draw up to 125 Mtris/s. However, before it can perform that speedy two-cycle setup for any given triangle, the triangle-setup unit needs to have the three vertices of the triangle delivered to it, and therein lies a performance issue that can reduce performance far below 125 Mtris/s. ve seen how memory fetching, the pre-T&L cache, the vertex shaders, and the post-T&L cache work to make vertices available as they re needed. The speed with which a vertex is delivered varies, depending on what stage of the pipeline was the source for that particular use of the vertex. Obviously, it takes much longer to fetch a vertex all the way from memory and shade it than it does to fetch it from the post-T&L cache, already shaded. However, even the post-T&L cache isn t instantaneous. It takes up to 6 clocks to copy a vertex from the post-T&L cache, depending on the number and types of attributes in the vertex. The following lists the groups of attributes that can be copied in a single clock; adding the first member of a group to a vertex costs 1 clock, after which additional members are free. position, point size, diffuse, specular fog, back diffuse, back specular texture 0 texture 1 texture 2 texture 3 Therefore, copying all three vertices for a triangle would take 6 clocks for a minimally interesting triangle (one with position, diffuse color, and one set of texcoords), and potentially much more for richer attribute sets. For instance, it would take a full 18 clocks to copy all three vertices of a triangle that sported position, diffuse, specular, four texcoords, and fog. In both of the above cases, using the post-T&L-cached vertices is faster than reshading them from scratch, let alone refetching them from memory, but it s certainly slower than the maximum speed of 2 clocks of which triangle setup is capable; even the minimal two-attribute case would limit the Xbox GPU to a maximum speed of about 42 Mtris/s, a far cry from the 125 Mtris/s it s actually capable of. The missing piece of the puzzle for achieving maximum performance is the primitive-assembly cache, which lies between the post-T&L cache and the triangle-setup unit. This is a tiny LRU cache, storing just three vertices, that gathers together the three vertices needed by triangle setup to draw each triangle, and delivers them to the triangle-setup unit. Immediately after a triangle is drawn, the three vertices in the primitive-assembly cache are, of course, the three vertices used to draw that triangle. At that point, what happens next depends on what type of primitive is being drawn. The following discussion examines the performance of the primitive-assembly cache with various types of primitives, assuming that all required vertices are in the post-T&L cache. If vertices are not in the post-T&L cache, performance can and probably will be much slower, in accordance with the shading and memory-fetching performance issues discussed above. s worth noting that it is only with trilists that you can exert any direct influence over the operation of the primitive-assembly cache, by means of vertex ordering and sharing. Each of the other primitives performs primitive-assembly caching consistently from one triangle to the next, regardless of vertex ordering or sharing. In the following discussion, #attrclks refers to the number of clocks taken to copy the attributes in the vertex, as described above. The maximum rates described are for the position+diffuse+one-texture case. Trilists. The three vertices that triangle setup requires for each triangle are arbitrary in the case of trilists that is, they can be any vertices in the vertex buffer, and have no specific relationship to the vertices of the last triangle that was drawn (which are the vertices that are stored in the primitive-assembly cache at the start of the current triangle). Thus, for each of the first two vertices, the primitive-assembly cache is satisfied if that vertex is already in the cache; if not, it has to wait for the vertex to be provided by the post-T&L cache. If the vertex is in the primitive-assembly cache, the check takes only 1 clock. If the vertex is in the post-T&L cache, it takes #attrclks clocks to obtain the vertex. If the vertex is not in either cache, the the primitive-assembly cache has to wait for the pipeline to deliver the vertex, which involves fetching it from memory or the pre-T&L cache and shading it. (Of course, all this is pipelined, so the various parts of the pipeline don t ask for a vertex and then sit around waiting; they re all processing in parallel. The performance of the pipeline is determined by whichever part takes longest which in the case we re describing here is most likely the vertex shader, or possibly vertex fetching.) The third vertex in the triangle is assumed not to be in the primitive-assembly cache, and is always copied, at a cost of #attrclks clocks. In total, then, between #attrclks+2 and #attrclks*3 clocks depending on whether each of the first two vertices were in the primitive-assembly cache are required to draw a single triangle from a trilist. Even for the two-attribute case, it takes between 4 and 6 clocks to get the three vertices of a trilist triangle into the primitive-assembly cache. (Again, of course, this assumes that the vertices were all in the post-T&L cache; if not, clock counts can go much higher.) This yields a maximum rate of 62.5 Mtris/s with perfect primitive-assembly caching, or 42 Mtris/s with worst-case primitive-assembly caching. Both figures are well below the maximum 125 Mtris/s the Xbox GPU is actually capable of. Bear in mind that if the first vertex isn t in the primitive-assembly cache and has to be copied in from the post-T&L cache, it evicts the least-recently-used vertex from the primitive-assembly cache. Therefore, if the first vertex in a triangle misses the primitive-assembly cache, the second vertex will effectively have only two primitive-assembly cache entries to try to hit, rather than three. And, of course, the third vertex is always fetched from the post-T&L cache, so it has no opportunity at all to be cached in the primitive-assembly cache. However, if the first vertex in a triangle hits the primitive-assembly cache, that entry is reused, and nothing is evicted from the primitive assembly cache. Thus, the ordering of vertices within a triangle can affect how many primitive-assembly cache hits there are.  One attractive feature of trilists is that because the vertex order of each triangle is explicitly specified, each triangle can be specified starting with any of its three vertices. This means that after drawing a triangle, the next triangle can get full primitive-assembly caching while sharing any one of the three sides of the first triangle. For example, if a triangle is drawn in order 0, 1, 2, then the following possibilities exist for the next triangle: 2, 1, 3 0, 2, 3 1, 0, 3 In all three cases, the first two vertices hit the primitive-assembly cache. In contrast, a tristrip would allow only triangle 2, 1, 3 to be drawn. Therefore, trilists support considerably more varied and flexible primitive-assembly-cache-efficient triangle orderings than tristrips do. A bonus with trilists is that the primitive-assembly cache is not flushed between one trilist and the next (it is flushed between any other combination of primitives), so long as no renderstates are changed. Note that the hardware automatically flushes the post-T&L cache whenever a state change occurs; software never needs to worry about stale entries in this cache. Tristrips. Unlike trilists, the first two vertices in tristrips are not arbitrary in the least re the last two vertices from the previous triangle. As a result, there s no need to expend one cycle checking whether each is in the primitive-assembly cache, and certainly no need to ever expend any clocks copying those vertices from the post-T&L cache. The first triangle in a tristrip takes #attrclks*3 clocks, because the primitive-assembly cache is flushed between all primitives other than two trilists in a row, so all three vertices have to be copied into the primitive-assembly cache to start a new tristrip. After that, however, the only work that the primitive-assembly cache has to do per triangle in a tristrip is copy the third vertex over, at a cost of #attrclks clocks total 6 clocks for the eight-attribute case, 2 clocks for the two-attribute case, yielding a maximum rate of 125 Mtris/s. Trifans. As with tristrips, the predictable vertex reuse pattern of trifans makes for efficient primitive-assembly caching. The first triangle in a trifan requires #attrclks*3 clocks to copy all three vertices into the primitive-assembly cache; each succeeding triangle in a trifan copies only the one new vertex, at a cost of #attrclks clocks. This yields the same 125 Mtris/s maximum rate as trilists. Quadlists. For performance purposes, a quadlist is similar to a set of four-vertex trilists. In particular, no primitive-assembly caching occurs between one quad and the next, just as would be the case for two four-vertex trilists drawn as separate primitives. Therefore, each quad takes #attrclks*4 clocks (as always, assuming all vertices in the quad are in the post-T&L cache when processing of the quad begins). This yields a maximum rate of about 31 Mquads/s, equivalent to 62.5 Mtris/s. Quadstrips. For performance purposes, a quadstrip is effectively a tristrip. It takes #attrclks*3 clocks for the first triangle (#attrclks*4 clocks for the first quad), and then takes #attrclks clocks for each succeeding triangle (#attrclks*2 clocks for each succeeding quad). This yields a maximum rate of 62.5 Mquads/s, equivalent to the Xbox GPU s maximum rate of 125 Mtris/s. Notes on the primitive-assembly cache As you can see, the primitive-assembly cache, though small, has a huge impact on performance. One further note of interest is that once a vertex is in the primitive-assembly cache, it is okay if it gets evicted from the post-T&L cache. In other words, there are three separate, hierarchical caches in the T&L pipeline, and the only cache that has to contain the three vertices of the current triangle before that triangle can be drawn is the primitive-assembly cache. It doesn t matter if any or all of those vertices have already been evicted from the pre- and post-T&L caches, so long as they re in the primitive-assembly cache when they re needed. As an example, imagine that the three vertices of a triangle, in order of index appearance in the triangle, are vertices A, B, and C. Further assume that vertex A was used by the previous triangle, and is therefore already in the primitive-assembly cache when setup begins for this triangle. Vertex B is then requested, and is not in the post-T&L cache, so it s fetched and shaded and placed in the post-T&L cache, then copied into the primitive-assembly cache. Now, suppose that when vertex B is added to the post-T&L cache, the vertex it evicts is vertex A; does this have any impact on the performance of this triangle? The answer is no, since at this point vertex A is already safely ensconced in the primitive-assembly cache. Tristrips versus trilists overall s step back for a moment to see what the implications of all this are for the choice of tristrips versus trilists. There s no question about which of the two is easier to use in general: that d be trilists, with their complete flexibility regarding both triangle ordering and per-triangle vertex ordering. There s also no question which of the two is easier to use when optimizing meshes for the T&L pipeline caches: trilists again. Unfortunately, the performance analysis leans heavily in the other direction. For starters, consider that, all other things being equal, tristrips require 4 bytes less memory bandwidth per triangle (after the first triangle), because only one index is required per triangle, rather than three. There s another reason tristrips often consume less memory bandwidth than trilists, and that s that for indexed vertex buffers that pass through the main push-buffer (that is, all indexed vertex buffers drawn through DrawIndexedPrimitive, as opposed to those in precompiled static push-buffers), the indices must be copied by the CPU from the index array into the push-buffer. Tristrips reduce this copying load by two-thirds. If static push-buffers are used, there s no additional copying overhead for trilists, but there is the issue of increased memory footprint. Finally, as you ll recall from our discussion of the primitive-assembly cache, tristrips can be fed to the triangle-setup unit at a rate of #attrclks clocks per triangle. Trilists, in comparison, can be fed to the triangle-setup unit at a rate of #attrclks+2 clocks per triangle at best. What all this means is that if you want to get maximum performance out of the T&L pipeline, you should use tristrips for the bulk of your drawing. Microsoft s mesh optimization code is one easy way to do this. If you want to write your own code to do this, there are a few things that it may be helpful to keep in mind, as follows. Further mesh optimization thoughts The first mesh-optimization consideration is that within a single DrawPrimitive that is, within a single tristrip you can use degenerate triangles to move around the mesh in ways that tristrips normally (that is, when they use non-degenerate triangles) cannot. Degenerate triangles (triangles where two or three vertices are identical) are guaranteed to not draw any pixels on the Xbox GPU; in fact, they never get past triangle setup. Degenerate triangles can easily be drawn as part of a tristrip simply by using the same index twice in a row. (This actually results in two degenerate triangles in a row, since two triangles in a row will have the duplicated index.) Thus, you can draw two noncontiguous sets of triangles as part of a single tristrip as follows: Here the tristrip consists of the following indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the dotted line shows the location of the two degenerate triangles (resulting in no pixels actually being drawn) connecting the two triangle sets. There are also degenerate triangles between 4 and 5 and between 6 and 7. Now, degenerate triangles aren t free; it takes four or five degenerate triangles (depending on whether the winding polarities of the old and new triangle sets match) to jump from one normal tristrip to another. Fortunately, the Xbox GPU can process each of those triangles in just 2 clocks. The vertices are guaranteed to be in the post-T&L cache, with the exception of the first appearance of each vertex, and would have been just as expensive in the absence of degenerate triangles. Therefore, the total incremental cost of using degenerate triangles to move around the mesh is 8 to 10 clocks. Again, it s not free but if doing this lets you get better caching in the T&L pipeline, it s probably worth it. If you have a 20-clock vertex shader, caching just one more vertex at the cost of five degenerate triangles easily pays for itself. Another thing to consider is that the pre-T&L and post-T&L caches are persistent between primitives, even primitives of different types, so long as no renderstates are changed. (The primitive-assembly cache, however, persists only from one trilist to the next.) Thus, using degenerate triangles is not the only way to stitch together noncontiguous primitives in the same mesh; using separate primitives is a viable alternative. There s no clear best choice between the two; each approach degenerate triangles and separate primitives has advantages and disadvantages. The degenerate-triangle approach uses four or five degenerate triangles to switch to a noncontiguous tristrip, at a cost of 8 to 10 clocks, and 8 to 10 bytes of memory for the extra indices. The separate-primitive approach uses a new DrawPrimitive command, at a cost of about 5 clocks an improvement over the degenerate-triangle approach. On the downside, it takes 20 bytes of push-buffer data to stop one primitive and start another, and that costs bandwidth. In fact, if static push-buffers aren t being used, it costs bandwidth three times, once for Microsoft  Direct3D  to read 20 bytes from the index buffer, once for Direct3D to write 20 bytes to the push-buffer and once for the GPU to read it back out, for a total incremental cost over four to five degenerate triangles of 30 to 36 bytes of bandwidth. s impossible to place an exact performance cost on 30 to 36 bytes of bandwidth, but a ballpark figure is 3 MCLKs, which works out to roughly 4 GPU clocks. Ironically, that brings the total cost of the separate-primitive approach to 9 clocks smack dab in the middle of the 8 to 10 cycles that four to five degenerate triangles take. If static push-buffers are used, the bandwidth cost is less, but inflated static-push-buffer footprints become an issue as they pick up 10 to 12 extra bytes of memory with every primitive switch. One bonus of the separate-primitive approach is that it lets you mix and match primitive types to best suit your needs. So, for example, you could use whatever combination of tristrips, trilists, and trifans lets you obtain the best vertex caching with the smallest footprint. In fact, you could mix the two approaches, using tristrips with degenerate triangles for most of a mesh, but using a mix of primitives to fill in the gaps with the best possible caching and minimum memory bandwidth. The bottom line: the best mesh-optimization approach is highly context dependent, and both approaches discussed above are worth considering. s worth keeping in mind that another respect in which the best approach is context dependent is that the relative performance of the T&L pipeline versus the rasterization pipeline determines the extent to which specific T&L optimizations are worth bothering with. If all you re drawing is 10,000-pixel triangles, it doesn t much matter what you do in the T&L pipeline; you might as well use trilists if you want, and have 100-instruction vertex shaders, for that matter.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft There are two major vertex-related factors that can limit performance: bandwidth and vertex calculations TitleThere are two major vertex-related factors that can limit performance: bandwidth and vertex calculations Hung H. Nguyen Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0ulations, because of the use of a point light and texgen. Y: you can use the BenMarkX sample to explore all the phenomena discussed below. It's what we used to figure a lot of this out. Note also that the vertex cache is actually a 16-entry FIFO; there's no reordering and no LRU. However, the FIFO sometimes is effectively between 10 and 15 entries rather than 16 entries. I; in all the instances discussed below, it is effectively 15 entries, so all optimization is for a 15-vertex cache.  Bandwidth v s best to read sequentially through memory, touching each vertex once. However, it's much faster to touch memory that's in the same memory page (inside the RAM, not the AGP/CPU page) than to cross pages. Thus, if you have a tristrip that snakes back and forth like this (I'm just showing triangle order, not vertices, and the vertices between the rows are shared):  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 then even though the 16-entry vertex cache always blows out (each vertex misses the cache on the second row, hence 2X as many vertices fetched over AGP), the bandwidth is still sufficient to support about 85 percent% of the performance you get with this:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 where every vertex is fetched exactly once. There may be some internal memory caching at work here too, but since this phenomenon works for pretty wide cases, it appearslooks like that it's probably just muchthat it's way faster to fetch something in the same page as recent fetches. The net effect is that in while for the second case above, about 500 Mb/s is fetched over AGP, while infor the first case, nearly 700 Mb/s is fetched, so clearly there's a significant win from locality. The precedingabove discussion might make it seem as if bandwidth isn't really that big a problem ; use indexed tristrips to keep bandwidth relatively low and get the guaranteed 3X vertex caching tristrips always give you, share all vertices, and you're set. This ignores two things, however.  First, the above result is in a system where in which very little is going on other than the GPU grabbing vertices. The CPU is virtually idle. If the CPU is making heavy memory demands, the GPU will have to share AGP bandwidth with the CPU, and the extra vertex fetches will become more expensive. Second, thise above result is for a case where in which per-vertex calculations are cheap --one directional light. The vertex cache helps with bandwidth, but it's potentially even more important that it saves on per-vertex calculations. For example, if you turn on one1 spotlight in the BenMarkX sample, the first case above drops to 62 percent% of the second case. With increasing use of texgen, hardware lighting, and custom vertex shading programs with Microsoft  DirectX  8.0 (all of which also help save bandwidth as well), saving per-vertex calculations will become an ever more important benefit of the vertex cache. So what are the implications of this? The simplest response is to use tristrips generated by a tristripper that vertex-optimizes the strips; one will be available for Xbox shortly. Such tristrips are not typical tristrips, because of the need to optimize for the vertex cache. For sufficiently large meshes, the ideal tristrip is organized as follows (I'll call this style "typewriter" style, because of the up- and- to- the- left "carriage return"): 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44  |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ | 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 The drawing order is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14 (degenerate triangles to prime the vertex cache) 0, 0 (degenerate triangles to move left) 15, 1, 16, 2, 17, 3, 18, 4, 19, 5, 20, 6, 21, 7, 22, 8, 23, 9, 24, 10, 25, 11, 26, 12, 27, 13, 28, 14, 29 29, 15, 15 (degenerate triangles to move left) 30, 16... This has 4 degenerate triangles per row (although this it only costs 8 bytes of bandwidth for extra indices, plus triangle setup time, but triangle setup doesn't appear to be a limiting factor on NV15, and should be even less so on the Xbox GPU). It gets optimal vertex caching. Meshes wider than this should be broken into stacks like the one above. Stacks that are 6 vertices wide or less, and short stacks/small meshes (because of the priming cost) should be done as follows (I'll call this style "S" style): 18 19 20 21 22 23  |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ | 17 16 15 14 13 12  | /| /| /| /| /|  1  3  5  7  9 11  |\ |\ |\ |\ |\ |  0  2  4  6  8 10 The drawing order is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 11 (degenerate triangles to move up) 12, 9, 13, 7, 14, 5, 15, 3, 16, 1, 17 17 (degenerate triangles to move up) 18, 16, 19, 15, 20, 14, 21, 13, 22, 12, 23 This has 2 degenerate triangles per row, and gets optimal vertex caching for a mesh of this width. However, if it gets any wider it falls out of the vertex cache, and putting adjacent stacks of S tristrips together runs slower than equivalent typewriter tristrips, because of the lost vertex sharing at the edges between the stacks. Note that the vertex cache has 16 entries, but in actual use it may effectively be 15 entries in size. (I have heard it may even be 14, but have not observed this.) Vertices should be stored in order of first appearance of their index in the index list. In conjunction with S or typewriter tristrips, this results in sequential memory access for vertices, which is good. (In fact, if there are no stacks --if the mesh width can be covered within the vertex cache --both memory access and caching are optimal with this approach.) Note also that it may pay to pack tristrips so that if multiple stacks are needed, the stacks are sized to fit within a single page, andso that a minimum number of page crossings are needed. Alternatively, the vertices along the edges between stacks could be duplicated, which increases the memory footprint slightly but allows completely sequential vertex fetching. In both cases, however, I'm speculating, and experiments are needed to determine what works best. One great thing about all this is that for static meshes, all this optimization can be precalculated and gotten into near-optimal state. (For real-world meshes, getting it optimal is probably NP-complete, but it should be easy to come close.)  It's harder for procedurally generated meshes, although the more of the above considerations they follow, the better they'll run. At a minimum, always use tristrips, which have one-third the index bandwidth and guarantee 3X vertex caching (less along edges, but in that ballpark overall). (NoteUnderstand, though, that procedurally-generated geometry will have a significant handicap in that it will have to come over the front-side bus from the CPU, which is limited to 1 Gb/s, . Sso if it's used, it should probably be in moderation in conjunction with lots of static meshes and/or generated occasionally as opposed to every frame.) I can't think of any reason at the moment why any Xbox game should ever use trilists for static meshes (especially since because the Xbox GPU will process tristrips faster than trilists, even disregarding bandwidth and caching considerations). Trilists may be better for dynamically generated geometry, due to the expense of generating tristrips. Any kind of mesh with reasonable vertex caching is, of course, much better than individual triangles with no sharing. All of the factors we've found that slow down Carol & Tamer --44-byte vertices, poor vertex sharing, use of trilists instead of tristrips, a point light, and texgeneration --are addressed by the above suggestions. (CertainlyOf course, removing 12 bytes of u, v, and w for the texgen'd texture also helps; they're not needed since because texgen creates the texcoords.) Bear in mind that the higher-order surfaces (HOS) processor generates high-quality meshes with about 4 -5X vertex caching into a separate HOS cache. The 4 -5X vertex caching does a good job of saving per-vertex calculations, and there's potentially a large bandwidth savings from sending only the patch information over AGP --the vertices and indices themselves are entirely handled inside the chip. TFinally, these above results are for NV15 pulling VBs vertex buffers over AGP at 1 Gb/s, maximum. Xbox will be very different, with a unified memory architecture yielding 5+ Gb/s for the GPU's use. However, that 5+ Gb/s will have to be shared with fill, texture, and video scanning demands. Also, the Xbox GPU will be able to process a lot more vertices and triangles than NV15 --triangle setup is 5X as fast, and vertex processing is 3 -5X as fast. So in general, the above analysis, tips, and tristrip optimization should apply well to the Xbox GPU. Use of vertex compression, vertex shading, and front-to-back drawing to reduce bandwidth demands will also be useful techniques to avoid bandwidth squeezes on Xbox.  qj_N=N_=_N_ vdRvdv

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. Xbox Technical Certification Requirements  Title _PID_HLINKSXbox Technical Certification Requirements  Xbox Technical Certification Team Normal Xbox Technical Certification Team Microsoft Word 9.0Xbox Technical Certification Requirements The following sections detail technical requirements: HYPERLINK  \l "_Overview_1" \t "_self" Overview HYPERLINK  \l "_Compatibility" \t "_self" Compatibility HYPERLINK  \l "_Quality" \t "_self" Quality HYPERLINK  \l "_Policy" \t "_self" Policy HYPERLINK  \l "_Security" \t "_self" Security HYPERLINK  \l "_Contacts/Resources" \t "_self" Contacts/Resources HYPERLINK  \l "_Copyright_Information" \t "_self" Copyright Information Overview  Technical certification requirements (TCR) detail certification standards that are measurable and quantifiable. During the compliance testing phase of the certification process, each game will be tested to ensure that these requirements are met. The purpose of the technical certification requirements can be broken into four major categories: compatibility, quality, policy, and security ption. Many of the technical requirements are instituted to prevent platform degradation that will affect end-user experience. The requirements detailed here are subject to change in the future. Furthermore, additional requirements may be stipulated in future releases of the Xbox Guide. Reference only the most up-to-date guide. The final certification test process will verify compliance with the technical requirements. Microsoft may, at its discretion, run parts of a technical compliance test during the mandatory pre-certification submission. If a compliance problem is discovered, Microsoft will notify the game publisher. This notification is strictly advisory in nature. Not receiving this notification does not indicate that compliance to technical requirements has been verified or completed. For more information about certification submissions, see the  HYPERLINK  \l "_Submissions" \t "_self" Submissions  section of the Guide. In addition to compliance with technical requirements, functionality of advertised features (icons) will be tested during the functional testing phase. TCR is broken into four large categories by their stated objectives. The beginning of each section outlines the purpose and philosophy behind each. Compatibility   Compatibility requirements are instituted to ensure that games remain compatible with the Xbox console through the life of the product. Quality   Quality requirements are designed to prevent degradation of the gaming experience, loss of functionality, and poor performance. Policy   Policy requirements ensure that every Xbox game follows standards so that consistent, intuitive operation of menus and basic functionality are always available. Security   Security requirements are designed to protect the integrity of the platform and user experience. Technical Requirement Key Each technical requirement is documented using the following template. See the explanations of each template section in this key for more information. X-Y-Z Requirement Name Requirement: a brief description of the requirement. Objective Measure: an example of how the Xbox Certification team will determine whether a game meets this requirement. Modifications: (optional) indicates conditional applicability of the requirement. It may indicate conditions under which the requirements apply. Remarks: (optional) in the future, remarks will be used to clarify, illustrate, or amend a requirement.  Using this template, all requirements will be numbered using the X-Y-Z format. In this format, X denotes the version number of the Technical Requirements specification, Y denotes the section within the Technical Requirements specification, and Z denotes the specific requirement number. This Release This is the first release of components of the final TCR for launch titles. While these requirements should not be viewed as complete, each requirement has been reviewed and agreed upon to be a part of the final TCR set. For this release, the level of detail is still not complete, and not all of the requirements are published. Additional requirements and supplemental information on existing ones will be made available in subsequent releases of the Xbox Guide. Compatibility  The following requirements are intended to ensure that Xbox games remain compatible with the Xbox video game system over the life of the console.

Finally, the tester will examine data transferred over the LAN to ensure that the soundtrack data is not transmitted.   0.9-3-35 Global Settings Update Requirement: Games are not permitted to update global system settings. Games may, however, allow the gamer to override a specific global setting for the duration of a gameplay session. Objective Measure:  Testers will monitor the settings area during all phases of gameplay to ensure that no updates occur. 0.9-3-36 System Clock Requirement: Games are not permitted to alter the Xbox on-board real-time clock. Games may, at the request of the gamer, temporarily override the clock value by adding their own bias to the real-time clock display. Objective Measure: During certification, testers will monitor the real-time clock to ensure that the time remains consistent.  0.9-3-37 Attract Mode Requirement: Games must contain an attract feature that causes an unattended game to enter a mode displaying representative gameplay or other interesting game features. The attract mode sequence must continue for at least 60 seconds without repeating. Objective Measure: The tester will leave the game at the initial interactive game screen to ensure that attract mode is entered.  0.9-3-38 Attract Mode Cycle Requirement: When idle, games must cycle between the initial interactive screen and the attract mode at least every 75 seconds. Objective Measure: The tester will leave the game at the initial interactive game screen to ensure that it enters attract mode and that the cycle between the initial screen and the attract mode repeats periodically.  0.9-3-39 Attract Mode Stability Requirement: The game must be capable of remaining in the cycle between the interactive state and the attract mode for at least one week. Objective Measure: During certification, the tester will leave the game alone for at least one week to ensure that the game properly cycles in and out of the attract mode and remains stable.  0.9-3-40 Attract Mode Interrupt Requirement: A button press, controller insertion, or memory unit insertion, must stop a game s demo sequence within one second.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. XBox SpecsTemplate Title _AdHocReviewCycleID _EmailSubject _AuthorEmail _AuthorEmailDisplayName Here's the doc file from scott loomis that I'll be throwing on the CD this release. coneill@microsoft.com Colin O'NeillXBox SpecsTemplate a-setho XDK_Specs_HLAUG.dot Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags Month l/m:d UzWA4@ \>iwxiP f{Z&f{Z&dbjbjk nsoles. While the communication protocol remains the same as HID, the complicated descriptor parsing is eliminated. Instead, XID defines various device types and subtypes. From these, the set of reports and report structures are known. Hardware is constrained to using the report formats defined by the Xbox team and must scale their data appropriately. Future expandability is provided for by allowing later versions to append new fields to the existing reports and add additional reports. The host Universal Serial Bus (USB) software is designed to mask future extensions from legacy clients. The device type, subtype, and report lengths are reported in new XID defined VENDOR specific descriptor. Additionally, there is a VENDOR-specific GET_CAPABILITIES command that describes the validity of fields in a report. These additions are VENDOR, rather than CLASS specific, so that the device may continue to function (from a firmware standpoint) on a HID compliant system. Such firmware would simply support both sets of descriptors. A similar strategy will likely be pursued for force feedback devices in the future. New output reports would be added exactly as they are in Physical Interface Device (PID) standards, only the descriptor would not be provided. The Xbox team would publish the structure and format of the reports associated with force feedback devices. The vibration motors do not use this approach because PID is overkill for two motors. A simple vibration output report is defined instead. Goals XID is a proprietary USB class designed as a simplified alternative to the Human Interface Device (HID) class specification for USB devices. The goals of the standard are: A simple standard for Xbox game controllers and other Xbox input controls. Future expandability allowing backward compatibility for both titles and devices (i.e., the common supported features always work). Coexistence with HID so that a single firmware stock keeping unit (SKU) can support both XID and HID. Support for simple device output (vibration motors, LEDs (light emitting diodes). Operational Model Endpoints XID devices normally have three endpoints: the default endpoint, an interrupt-IN endpoint, and an interrupt-OUT endpoint. The interrupt-OUT endpoint is optional (for example, devices that do not receive output from the system vibration motors, LEDs, etc. do not require this endpoint). XID will use the first interrupt-IN and interrupt-OUT endpoints associated with the interface and neglect all others. Input and Output Reports XID uses the same system of input and output as HID. XID input reports are usually transmitted on the interrupt-IN endpoint, and output reports on the interrupt-OUT endpoint. Unlike HID, XID reports must be less than or equal to the maximum packet size (wMaxPacketSize in the endpoint descriptor) of the applicable endpoint. Since the Xbox game system only supports full-speed devices, this is not too onerous. Additionally, all XID reports begin with a one-byte Report ID. Under HID, this is true only if a Report ID item appears in the report descriptor. The standard HID commands GET_REPORT and SET_REPORT (defined later in this document) can be used to transmit reports over the default control endpoint rather than the interrupt endpoints. The packet size of the device must be big enough to contain a complete report. No report may be larger than 64 bytes the largest allowed packet size. Device Types and Subtypes The device type defines the primary use of the device (game controller, DVD remote controller, and so on). If a game supports a device type, it supports all devices of that type. The number of reports, their direction (input or output), and their format (field offsets, sizes, default values, and ranges) are determined by the device type and version. Future versions will never remove reports or alter the size or offset of existing fields or alter their meaning in a way that would make them incompatible with existing titles. The Xbox system software ensures that devices built for future versions appear identical to the version a game was compiled against. The device subtype implies additional information about the device, such as form factor and specific mapping of controls to the report fields. For example, a wheel subtype of the game controller type would indicate the position of the steering wheel in field determined by the subtype. The published mappings are designed so that most games will be able to ignore the subtype. However, a driving game (as an example) would probably want (and for some certifications, would be required) to tune gameplay to the standard controller and a steering wheel independently. These games would use the subtype to choose which mapping and tuning parameters to use. Games will most likely have to use subtype when designing their controller remapping interfaces. Field Scaling and Unused Fields Devices should provide a minimum set of controls to be usable with the intended genre of games. (The standard Xbox Controller is intended to work well with all games.) A device is not required to provide a physical control for every field in every report. Such controls should always report the specified default value. Additionally, devices are expected to scale the reported values to published specifications (see Appendix A).  The following guidelines should be applied when scaling and clipping raw data. For displacement controls, the processed data reported should be an affine transformation from the actual axis displacment.  For pressure sensitive controls, such as proportional buttons, this guideline does not apply. Axes should be clipped at the extremes such that all axis go to full scale in both directions.  Be sure that the extreme values are really full scale and not merely close. Each axis should be processed independently.  For example, a thumb stick with a circular range of motion will report at full scale in the X or Y axis only. Games expect a certain amount of jitter in axis position.  At most only minimal smoothing or filtering of raw data should be done. In keeping with c), firmware should not attempt data processing report the median value of the range in the center position of thumbsticks.  Games will expect as much as +/- 12% in the reported center value.  They will also expect good fine control in the center, so do NOT implement a dead zone in firmware. GET_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES (defined later in this document) is intended to allow the interested title to determine which controls actually exist on the device and to determine their intrinsic resolutions. Not all games are expected to use this information. Compound and Composite Devices The standard Xbox Controller is a compound device. There is an internal hub that has port 1 hard-wired to the controller functionality. The two slots are USB ports, and the expansion devices are USB devices. Xbox system software also supports composite devices. A composite device is defined in the USB Common Class Feature Specification: Logical Devices.  A USB device that provides more than one function to a host by declaration of class codes at the interface level.  XID audio and memory unit devices are all classes defined at the interface level. Xbox software supports composite devices of these three types. Such composite devices will be indistinguishable at the title library level from similar compound devices. The order of the interface should be the same as the slot number in the similar compound device in order to maintain this indistinguishability. Xbox games will not take advantage of composite device features that are added after release of the game.  Polling Interval and Idle Rate The Xbox game system does not, in general, honor the bInterval in the endpoint descriptor of XID devices. It has two polling modes, auto-poll and manual poll. In auto-poll mode, the interval is 8 milliseconds. In manual poll mode, the game issues an IN request directly at its predetermined rate, most often at 16-millisecond intervals, in sync with the video frame. The Xbox game system does not support SET_IDLE as defined in the HID specification; the idle rate is effectively infinity on the Xbox game system. Regardless of polling rate and mode, which are unknown to the device, the device should be prepared to respond to IN requests at random intervals. It should always respond with the latest unreported state. If the state changes multiple times between IN requests, only the last state should be reported. If the state does not change between IN requests, the device should negatively acknowledge (NAK) the IN request, regardless of the time since the previous acknowledge (ACK). For practical reasons, a device may occasionally NAK a request even if the state has changed. Firmware should be designed to minimize this as much as possible. All current game devices are absolute devices (the standard input report contains the absolute state of the device). In the future, it may be desirable to support relative devices, such as mice, or relative controls on game devices. Devices with relative controls will need to coalesce changes between poll requests. Note: In our development program we have encountered problems with numerous chipsets in the area of overwriting data that has already been submitted to transfer.  This may make coalescing data difficult or impossible on some USB function chip implementations. Descriptors This section defines the various descriptors a XID device must support. Gray areas of the tables show standard fields that are not accessed by the Xbox system software. Italics indicate special handling.  Standard Device Descriptor Offset Field Value Description BLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes BDescriptorType Constant DEVICE descriptor type BcdUSB USB version BDeviceClass Class XID is an interface standard BDeviceSubClass SubClass Ignored BProtocol Protocol Ignored bMaxPacketSize0 Number (8, 16, 32, or 64) Maximum packet size for endpoint 0 IdVendor Vendor ID IdProduct Product ID Offset Field Value Description BcdDevice Device release number iManufacturer Index Index of string descriptor describing manufacturer iProduct Index Index of string descriptor describing product iSerialNumber Index Index of string descriptor describing the device s serial number bNumConfigurations Number Number of possible configurations The Xbox game system does not provide any way of accessing the manufacturer, product, or serial number strings. All Xbox XID devices must be defined in the first configuration. Standard Configuration Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant CONFIGURATION Descriptor Type. wTotalLength Number Total length of data returned for this configuration. This includes this descriptor, all the interface descriptors, and their endpoint descriptors. It may also include vendor-specific descriptors.  The Xbox game system constrains this value to be less than 256 bytes. bNumInterfaces Number Number of interfaces associated with the configuration. bConfigurationValue Number Value to use to set this configuration. On the Xbox game system, this must be 1. iConfiguration Index Index of string descriptor describing this configuration. bmAttributes Bitmap Ignored. MaxPower Ignored. The bmAttributes and MaxPower fields both refer to the power behavior of a device. In general, the Xbox game system does not support power features such as suspend mode and remote wakeup. Overall power consumption is regulated by strict limits on power consumption in the hardware specification of Xbox certified devices. The software does not refuse devices based on power consumption. It will handle current overload and overheating conditions. Standard Interface Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes bDescriptorType Constant INTERFACE Descriptor Type bInterfaceNumber Number Number of interface bAlternateSetting Number XID does not use alternate settings bNumEndpoints Index May be one or two, depending on whether the device has outputs bInterfaceClass Class 0x58 (or same as HID, 0x03) 1 bInterfaceSubClass SubClass Ignored bInterfaceProtocol Protocol Ignored iInterface Index Index of string descriptor describing interface  The XID interface class is 0x58.  However, the Xbox Game Console will also support a device that reports the HID class ID of 0x03.  This allows a single firmware SKU to support both XID and HID. While the Xbox System Software currently ignores bInterfaceSubClass, this should be set deliberately.  A value of 0x42 is recommended if 0x58 is used for the bInterfaceClass.  If 0x03 is used for the bInterfaceClass, then 0x00 must be used for the bInterfaceSubClass for compatibility with Windows.  Standard Endpoint Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant ENDPOINT Descriptor Type. bEndpointAddress Number Bit 3..0 Endpoint Number Bit 6..4 Reserved Must Be 0 Bit 7 Direction: 1 = IN, 0=OUT bmAttributes Bitmap 3 = interrupt endpoint. XID has only interrupt endpoints aside from the default endpoint, which does not have a descriptor. wMaxPacketSize Number For XID, the packet size must accommodate the largest report in a single packet. (8, 16, 32, and 64 are allowed values.) bInterval Number Polling interval in milliseconds. See Polling Interval and Idle Rate for details regarding why bInterval is ignored. XID Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant XID descriptor type. bcdXid Number XID version. bType Number The type of device. bSubType Number The subtype of device. bMaxInputReportSize Number Size of the largest input report. bMaxOutputReportSize Number Size of the largest output report. wAlternateProductIds Number Up to four-word alternate Product Ids for the purpose of identifying similar devices from the same manufacturer.  Unused entries should be 0xFFFF. The XID descriptor is obtained by using a VENDOR-defined version of GET_DESCRIPTOR (defined later in this document). The bMaxInputReportSize field is used to determine the required buffer size for reports on the interrupt-IN endpoint. bMaxOutputReportSize is the largest output report the device is expecting. The XID driver will truncate any reports longer than bMaxOutputReportSize, and bLength will be altered to reflect the size of the report the title expects. WAlternateProductIds   This field is currently unused.  There are no criteria at this time for a device to be listed as similar.  All entries should be treated as unused and filled with 0xFFFF. Requests Standard Requests XID devices should support the list of standard requests below. Refer to the USB Specification Revision 1.1 for details. CLEAR FEATURE for ENDPOINT_HALT GET_DESCRIPTOR for all standard descriptors SET_ADDRESS SET_CONFIGURATION HID Class Requests Only GET_REPORT and SET_REPORT from the HID specification need to be supported. SET_REPORT is only necessary for devices with output. In order to reduce the cross referencing, the format of these requests is duplicated here. GET_REPORT bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 10100001B GET_REPORT (0x01) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report wValue: The high byte is the report type (0x01 for input) and the low byte is the report ID. The data returned has the exact format as a report sent over the interrupt-IN endpoint. GET_REPORT may also be used to retrieve reports not normally sent over the interrupt-IN endpoint. The XID device type determines the existence of such reports. Details can be found in the appendixes. If the device does not support the specified report type and report ID, it should STALL the request. All report ID s not currently specified for a particular device type are reserved for future use with that device type.  Test reports should set the VENDOR bit in bmRequestType. SET_REPORT bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 00100001B SET_REPORT (0x09) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report wValue: The high byte is the report type (0x02 for output) and the low byte is the report ID. The data sent has the exact format as a report sent over the interrupt-OUT endpoint. XID devices that report non-zero bMaxOutputReportSize but do not have an interrupt-OUT endpoint will receive output reports with SET_REPORT. Devices that require low-latency output must support the interrupt-OUT endpoint. If the device does not support the specified report type and report ID, it should STALL the request. XID VENDOR Requests These requests are newly defined for XID. They are defined as VENDOR-specific so that they will not interfere with future changes to the HID specification. GET_DESCRIPTOR (for XID_DESCRIPTOR) bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 11000001B GET_DESCRIPTOR 0x4200 Interface Length XID_DESCRIPTOR GET_DESCRIPTOR is the same as the standard GET_DESCRIPTOR, except that bmRequestType indicates VENDOR-defined and that the request is for an interface rather than the whole device. GET_CAPABILITIES bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 11000001B GET_CAPABILITIES (0x01) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report Capabilities GET_CAPABILITIES returns the capabilities of the device with respect to a particular report. If the device does not support the specified Report Type and Report ID, it should STALL the request. If the device supports one or more fields, it should return a packet of the same structure as the report with a bit set for every bit that is functional in the report. This does not include calculated bits. If a field is 8-bits wide and scaled from 0 to 255, but the device only has six-bit resolution, the device should return 11111100B in that field. A device need only return data up to the last bit that would be set. In practice, USB requires whole bytes be returned. Fields after the last data returned are assumed to be unsupported. This is necessary to support future extensions of reports. Devices must support GET_CAPABILITIES for every report supported. Interaction with HID Protocol Without consideration of the proprietary connector, XID devices do not generally work with standard HID-compliant systems. Nothing in this specification should preclude an XID firmware-compliant device from also incorporating support for all of the HID requirements to work on a HID-compliant system. The only minor loss of functionality is that the reports must be scaled in firmware, and a HID-compliant system would not be able to determine their true physical range. Appendix Sections detailing each device will be added as they are further defined.

This value is subject to growth with future versions. Interpretation of Fields All devices must normalize the values they report and should report the full range. Where items in the table represent arrays, the min and max are given for each item in the array. Bits and bytes are stored in little-endian order (least significant bit (LSB) first, most significant bit (MSB) last). bmButtons Layout (lsb) (msb) S: Start Button B: Back Button U: Directional Pad Up D: Directional Pad Down L: Directional Pad Left R: Directional Pad Right LT: Left Thumb Stick Button RT: Right Thumb Stick Button N: Not Used When a button is pressed, the corresponding bit will be 1. When it is released, the corresponding bit will be 0.

Interpretation of Fields The speed is normalized. Devices should respond to the entire range. 0 indicates the motor is off. How wLeftMotorSpeed and wRightMotorSpeed map to the physical motor speeds will be determined later (linear, exponential, other?).

The target market for Xbox is the console game player market in which the console resides in the living room or bedroom, not in the office or den.  The Xbox console has four proprietary USB-based ports on the front to which controllers can be connected. Gamepads are compound controller/input devices, containing all gamepad functions (buttons, thumbsticks, triggers), plus a three-port USB hub. Inside the gamepad, the gamepad function is connected to port one of the downstream hub, while the other two ports are exposed to two module slots accessible to the user. The endpoints for the hub and device function are separate. The downstream module slots are designed to allow any of several planned modules to be connected.   The standard Xbox game controller is a console game input device held in two hands. It features the following components: Six action buttons offering eight-bit proportional (analog) control Two travel-based proportional (analog) triggers (eight-bit resolution) Two vibration feedback motors, one for low frequency forces, one for high frequency forces Two analog thumbsticks with integral momentary switches One eight-way directional pad Two menu navigation buttons (Back and Start) Two module expansion slots Xbox proprietary plug interface Inline quick release connector The Xbox game controller will support the following modules: Memory unit 8-MB memory unit module; 16-MB option TBD.    Audio unit (future)  headset with headphones and voice command microphone for online gaming. Light gun (future) light gun; supported by the vertical blanking interrupt (VBI) signal. Light gun must be a full speed USB device that reports its position in its own USB packet.   Tilt module (future)   sense the orientation of the controller in the X-Y-Z axis and allow user better immersion into some games Controller Configuration General Specification Feature Requirements Feature Reference Number Feature Parameter Full Function Gamepad Requirement Compatible  Gamepad  Min Requirement Compatible Custom Controller Min Requirement (MS approval required) Module slots 2 USB/VBI ports with proprietary connector (Hub + 3 downstream ports) 1 USB/VBI ports minimum (Hub + 2 downstream ports) Optional* (1 USBVBI port minimum is preferred) Vibration feedback 1 high frequency motor and 1 low frequency motor (per vibration specification) Optional* Optional* Thumbsticks 2 X/Y analog thumbsticks w/tact switches actuated when pressed down  7 bit (128 counts minimum) 2 X/Y analog thumbsticks w/tact switches actuated when pressed down  7 bit (128 counts minimum) Optional* Action buttons (A/B/X/Y, BLK/WHT) 6 proportional analog 6-8 bit (64 counts minimum) (color and layout per spec) 6 proportional analog 6-8 bit (64 counts minimum) (color and layout per spec) Optional* (minimum A/B required) Triggers left and right analog 6-8 bit (64 counts minimum) left and right analog 6-8 bit (64 counts minimum) Optional* Directional pad 8 way, digital direction pad 8 way, digital direction pad 8 way, digital direction pad Menu navigation buttons START  and   digital buttons START  and   digital buttons START  and   digital buttons Inline quick release connector  Inline connector required Inline connector required Inline connector required XBox interface XBox Full Speed Universal Serial Bus with proprietary connector XBox Full Speed Universal Serial Bus with proprietary connector XBox Full Speed Universal Serial Bus with proprietary connector * Optional features must meet full function requirements if used Xbox Interface Xbox Exceptions to the Full Speed USB 1.1 Specification No low speed device USB support No suspend/resume support No port power switching to downstream ports Power budget (see current budget table below) Connector interface to Xbox is proprietary Connector from controller to modules is proprietary USB Device Function Proprietary XID class device; see Xbox Input Device (XID) specification one control end point one interrupt in endpoint one interrupt out endpoint USB Hub Function one control end point  one interrupt IN endpoint downstream port 1: internally attached to gamepad function downstream port 2: primary module slot downstream port 3: secondary module slot USB Enumeration of Downstream Slots For top/bottom orientation: the top slot is primary; bottom slot is secondary If module slots have left/right orientation (while holding the controller), left slot is primary and right slot is secondary.

System Requirements: IE5 or better Win2000/SP2 or Win98 (WebDrive will only work with Win2000) IE Configuration: In IE, go to Tools-Internet Options-Security. Click on Custom Level. Enable launching programs and files in an IFRAME. Now go to https://xds.xbox.com (Note the https) Enter your user name and password (CASE SENSITIVE) at this screen. This can be a  copy and paste  from your email. File Transfer Page. Click on  Transfer  on the navigation image and then click on appropriate upload page link on left (Yours will not say PublicDrop) You will then see a window similar to this. You can drag and drop to and from this window. You can also browse within the directory structure, view file properties and cut and paste. Possible problems are the inability to copy htm files (asp, htm, html, xml : all flavors), without first zipping them or renaming them. We don't recommend attempting to copy files larger than 20MB. Larger files (or a large group of individual files) should be spanned across multiple compressed files using a compression utility like Turbozip. This utility will allow you to compress and span a large file (or a large group of individual files) across a set of cab files.  We now have a site license for WebDrive, which allows you to map a local drive to any FTP or WebDAV site (XDS.XBOX.COM is a WebDAV site) if you are using Win2000. Once Webdrive is enabled you will be able to use command line utilities such as copy, xcopy and robocopy to move files up to our site. Robocopy supports Network Restartable, which will allow you to begin and complete your upload unattended. You can download it from us by clicking the WebDrive. See the WebDrive section at the end of this document for details. WebDrive Configuration After installing WebDrive, open the Site Manager and configure a new site. Use the  following settings: The Username and password will be your login information. The drive letter can be set to any letter. Note: You will need to contact your Account Manager for specifics on which Site Address/URL to use. The format will follow https://xds.xbox.com/xdsdirectory/[TITLE] where TITLE is the game title you are working. You can find this URL on the file transfer page under the navigation link for your site.

A simple API to access the new 'Morpher' modifier using the SDK.

Contains two example files:


MorpherView - a utility that can show information about a morph channel,
		as well as edit and change it. 

MorpherMXS - an implimentation of a plugin for MAX Script allowing
		the morpher to be accessed through MXS.
		NB: Examine the 'commands.txt' file in that directory for a list
		of new functions that it adds.


Please read the file USAGE.TXT for information about functions and classes included

/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Main Class descriptions
\*===========================================================================*/

morphChannel

Each channel in the morpher is made up of a morphChannel class. It holds all the information
about a morph target that the morpher needs to be able to create the morph result.
It also holds functions that will initialize the class from nodes in the scene, rebuild the
internal data, delete the channel, etc. Think of this class being the morphic data management system.


morphCache

Most developers will not need to use this class, as it is internally managed to keep a 
persistent cache of the input morphable object.
Contains some functions to destroy and rebuild the cache.


MorphR3 : ( Modifier, TimeChangeCallback )

The main modifier class. 
This contains the bank of morphChannel records (in an array called chanBank), as well as the 
primary parameter block, various global variables and some functions for handling all the updating
or changing of the UI panels. Think of this class being the UI management system.


M3MatDlg : ( ParamDlg )
M3Mat : ( Mtl )

The two classes that manage the Morpher Material. Only small, but they allow the developer to
refresh the link to the morpher modifier, and access the various submaterials and settings thereof.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class morphChannel
\*===========================================================================*/

MorphR3		*mp;

	This is a pointer to the MorphR3 interface.

int			nPts;
int			nmPts;

	Two integer values describing the number of points in this record. The nPts 
	value is the total number of points in the object. The nmPts value is the
	number of 'morphable' points in the object. A morphable point is one that is
	significantly different from the original.

	One of the Morpher's optimization methods is to only work with those verticies
	that are different in position or weight than that of the original object. When
	a target is assigned and the optimizations are processed, this nmPts value will
	be filled with the number of 'different points'

int*		mOptdata;

	A list of the vertex indicies that are different - see above. The size of this array
	will be 'nmPts' long. This allows the morpher to know very quickly which verticies
	in the object are morphable.

Point3*		mPoints;
Point3*		mDeltas;
double*		mWeights;

	mPoints and mWeights contain the complete representation of the geometry of the object
	in point and weight (in terms of NURBS) form. These are used in advanced modifier tasks
	such as extracting objects from the morpher or creating morph targets from existing morph
	results. mDeltas are the difference values from the original values to the new target object.
	The morpher does the job of keeping all of these values up to date.

BitArray	mSel;

	A byte array of selected points, extracted from the target when processed.

INode*		mConnection;

	If this channel has an active connection to an object in the scene (ie, the original target
	node hasn't been deleted by the user), then this will contain the INode pointer to that
	target object.

TSTR		mName;

	The public name of the morphchannel - this is what is displayed in the channel list UI.

BOOL		mActive, mModded, mUseLimit, mUseSel;
float		mSpinmin,mSpinmax;

	Various, non-animatable stuff
	mActive is TRUE if the channel has data in it in some form
	mModded is TRUE if the channel has been changed in SOME form.
		ie, had its name changed or similar
	mUseLimit is TRUE if the channel limits are turned on
	mSpinmin and mSpinmax are the two clamp values for channel limits
	mUseSel is TRUE if the channel respects vertex/point selection

BOOL		mInvalid;
	
	Set to TRUE if the channel cannot be used in the morph result - ie, its point count is wrong, etc.
	It will appear as GREY STATUS in the channel list UI if set to TRUE.

BOOL		mActiveOverride;

	If FALSE, the channel is not used in the morph result. If TRUE, it is.
	It will appear as GREY STATUS in the channel list UI if set to FALSE.

IParamBlock* cblock;

	A parameter block per channel holds it's animatable channel value. It has only 
	one entry, index 0, which holds the floating point value.

void	ResetMe();

	Delete and reset the channel. NOTE: you still have to wire in a new paramblock into 
	the morph channel. Check the MorpherView utility for example code.

float	getMemSize();

	Get a rough approximation of the number of bytes this channel takes up in memory.

void	rebuildChannel();

	Rebuild the channel using the internal values, recalculate the optimization data, etc.

void	buildFromNode( INode *node );

	Take in a node from the scene, and initialize the channel with it. This is an important
	function that is used a lot by the Morpher UI to assign the channels with actual object data.
	Most channels will start out by using this function.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class morphCache
\*===========================================================================*/

void	NukeCache();
BOOL	AreWeCached();

	The only two functions that you may find useful here are the above. The NukeCache()
	call will remove all cached data and it will be rebuilt the next time the modifier
	is refreshed (ModifyObject gets called)

	AreWeCached will return TRUE if the cache is built. FALSE if it has been nuked and
	not rebuilt yet.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class MorphR3
\*===========================================================================*/

morphChannel		*chanBank;

	The 100 lenth array of morphChannel classes. You can get access to any of the
	morph channels by accessing this array, ie:

	chanBank[0].mName = _T(GetString(IDS_NEWCHAN_NAME));

int		chanSel;
int		chanNum;

	These two values work together to save the position in the UI that the user
	is looking at. chanSel is the 0-9 clamped number of the button on the UI, and
	chanNum is the 0-90 clamped value that shifts the list up and down.

	For instance, if the user is looking at channel 20, using the first button:

	chanSel = 0
	chanNum = 19

	Adding the values together gets the final channel being modified:

	chanBank[chanSel+chanNum].mActive = TRUE;

	A developer shouldn't directly change chanNum - use the VScroll function to do 
	this instead

ISpinnerControl		*chanSpins[10];
ISpinnerControl		*glSpinmin,*glSpinmax;

	Spinner controls - chanSpins are the 10 spinners controlling the channel values
	for the 10 viewable channels

HWND	hwGlobalParams, hwChannelList,	hwChannelParams, hwAdvanced, hwLegend;

	The window handles for the 5 UI panels.

morphCache MC_Local;

	The local cache, and only instance of the morphCache class. See above class
	description

Tab<int>			markerIndex;
NameTab				markerName;
int					markerSel;

	Marker Management - used to add or delete items from the marker dropdown list.
	The markerIndex and markerName must syncronise properly - the Index tab contains
	the 0-90 value for the marker itself, and Name contains the name to display in the
	dropdown list. markerSel is the Id of the marker selected in the dropdown list. If
	this value is -1, no marker is selected. To add a new marker, try:


		mp->markerName.AddName("Ishani's Marker");

		int tmp;
		tmp = 35;
		mp->markerIndex.Append(1,&tmp,0);

		mp->markerSel = mp->markerName.Count()-1;
		mp->Update_channelMarkers();


	(Where mp is a valid MorphR3 pointer)

void	VScroll(int code, short int cpos );

	Used to handle scrolling, but can be used to drive the UI scroller. To move to a specific location,
	use:

	mp->VScroll(SB_THUMBPOSITION,35);

	But where 35 is the chanNum offset you require.

void	ChannelOp(int src, int targ, int flags);

	function for moving or swapping morphChannels. the flags parameter can be one of the following:

	OP_MOVE
	OP_SWAP

	and src and targ being the 0-based channel index numbers you want to use.


OTHER NOTES:

	There are also many Update_<.....> functions, which will reload and display various
	chunks of the UI. Call them to update changes as you make them to the Morpher.


/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class M3MatDlg / M3Mat
\*===========================================================================*/

void	 UpdateMorphInfo(int upFlag);

	Called to update the information from Morpher Modifier -> Morpher Material. upFlag can be:

	UD_NORM		-- just redisplay the info
	UD_LINK		-- reconnect to the modifier, reload all information

	Also, if you want to change how the helper is created in the viewports,
	this file is where to start editing. Don't forget - if you change the
	display, you must also update the bounding box and hit-testing calculations
	to match up, or your object will either seem not to exist in the viewport,
	or leave drawing artifacts all over the screen.

Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

This material has just one submtl, and will multiply the shaded result from that
submtl by the simple param as its result. 

The material itself does no shading - rather, it passes the calls to the submtl and
lets it do it instead. It then takes the shaded result and multiplies by its single
float parameter.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] MtlShade.cpp - all the shading parameters are in here - change the algorithm in 
	Shade(...) to change the appearance of the material.

[] Material.cpp - when adding UI components and new submtls/subtexs, be sure to change
	the reference counts, the amount of subanims and submtls to match.
	Paramblock2 does most of the work with regard to the UI implimentations,
	so don't forget to use it when adding to the UI.

Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

Impliments a modifier derived from the base class Modifier, implimenting a full
mesh editing capability.

All this skeleton does, however, is add the simple value to every deformable
point in the mesh. However, it does take Soft Selection into account through the use
of the Object class' IsPointSelected and PointSelection methods.

Specific Customizations:

[] PureEdit.cpp - contains the vital ModifyObject implimentation that actually edits the 
	mesh in some way. The skeleton shows off how to handle soft selection (as mentioned
	above) and this generic method can be easily applied to all your algorithms.

[] PureModifier.h - contains the definition of the caches that get used and modified by
	the modifier : ChannelsUsed and ChannelsChanged. Don't forget to update them to 
	reflect your algorithm's use of the pipeline information.

This plugin implements support for the PNG bitmap format.
It relies on two libraries, libpng and zlib, the source
for which can be located at their respective home pages.

LibPNG:
http://www.wco.com/~png/
We've integrated version 0.96
A complete set of PNG test images is also located here

ZLib:
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
We've integrated version 1.0.4


Note:  the libpng source has been altered slightly from
the original as it is distributed for 0.96, in order to
eliminate compiler warnings.  Specifically, this meant
a type change for a variable in libpng\pngwtran.c. Other
than this change, the source is as distributed for both libraries.

It creates objects by drawing 2D curves in the normal planes around a 3D curve.  The 3D curve (called the {\i Base Curve} ) can either be a circle or a ({\i P,Q}) torus knot.  {\i P} and {\i Q} describe up and down and around-the-center winding numbers.  For  example a (2,3) torus knot is the classic trefoil knot.  If P and Q are equal, you get a (tilted) torus.  If P and Q are relatively prime, then you get a non-trivial knot.  If P and Q are not relatively prime you get a shape which is deformable into a to rus.  For the circle base curve, you get to set two parameters Warp Count and Warp Height described below. \par  \par The 2D curve (known as the {\i Cross Section}) is a circle with quite a few parameters of its own. \par  \par You create a torus knot by selecting \ldblquote Torus Knots\rdblquote  in the object category drop-down list under \ldblquote Geometry\rdblquote  in the object creation panel, and pressing the \ldblquote Knot\rdblquote   button.  You then drag out a torus knot in the same \par way you create a standard torus primitive. \par  \par Here is a description of the paramters: \par {\b     Base Curve:} \par         Circle\tab \tab Use a circle as a base curve \par         Torus Knot\tab \tab Use a torus knot as the base curve \par         Radius\tab \tab Radius of the base curve \par         Segments\tab \tab The number of mesh vertices around the base curve. \par         P,Q\tab \tab \tab The winding numbers, only for torus knot base curve. \par         Warp Count\tab \tab The number of "points" in a star shape around the curve.

/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Main Class descriptions
\*===========================================================================*/

morphChannel

Each channel in the morpher is made up of a morphChannel class. It holds all the information
about a morph target that the morpher needs to be able to create the morph result.
It also holds functions that will initialize the class from nodes in the scene, rebuild the
internal data, delete the channel, etc. Think of this class being the morphic data management system.


morphCache

Most developers will not need to use this class, as it is internally managed to keep a 
persistent cache of the input morphable object.
Contains some functions to destroy and rebuild the cache.


MorphR3 : ( Modifier, TimeChangeCallback )

The main modifier class. 
This contains the bank of morphChannel records (in an array called chanBank), as well as the 
primary parameter block, various global variables and some functions for handling all the updating
or changing of the UI panels. Think of this class being the UI management system.


M3MatDlg : ( ParamDlg )
M3Mat : ( Mtl )

The two classes that manage the Morpher Material. Only small, but they allow the developer to
refresh the link to the morpher modifier, and access the various submaterials and settings thereof.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class morphChannel
\*===========================================================================*/

MorphR3		*mp;

	This is a pointer to the MorphR3 interface.

int			nPts;
int			nmPts;

	Two integer values describing the number of points in this record. The nPts 
	value is the total number of points in the object. The nmPts value is the
	number of 'morphable' points in the object. A morphable point is one that is
	significantly different from the original.

	One of the Morpher's optimization methods is to only work with those verticies
	that are different in position or weight than that of the original object. When
	a target is assigned and the optimizations are processed, this nmPts value will
	be filled with the number of 'different points'

int*		mOptdata;

	A list of the vertex indicies that are different - see above. The size of this array
	will be 'nmPts' long. This allows the morpher to know very quickly which verticies
	in the object are morphable.

Point3*		mPoints;
Point3*		mDeltas;
double*		mWeights;

	mPoints and mWeights contain the complete representation of the geometry of the object
	in point and weight (in terms of NURBS) form. These are used in advanced modifier tasks
	such as extracting objects from the morpher or creating morph targets from existing morph
	results. mDeltas are the difference values from the original values to the new target object.
	The morpher does the job of keeping all of these values up to date.

BitArray	mSel;

	A byte array of selected points, extracted from the target when processed.

INode*		mConnection;

	If this channel has an active connection to an object in the scene (ie, the original target
	node hasn't been deleted by the user), then this will contain the INode pointer to that
	target object.

TSTR		mName;

	The public name of the morphchannel - this is what is displayed in the channel list UI.

BOOL		mActive, mModded, mUseLimit, mUseSel;
float		mSpinmin,mSpinmax;

	Various, non-animatable stuff
	mActive is TRUE if the channel has data in it in some form
	mModded is TRUE if the channel has been changed in SOME form.
		ie, had its name changed or similar
	mUseLimit is TRUE if the channel limits are turned on
	mSpinmin and mSpinmax are the two clamp values for channel limits
	mUseSel is TRUE if the channel respects vertex/point selection

BOOL		mInvalid;
	
	Set to TRUE if the channel cannot be used in the morph result - ie, its point count is wrong, etc.
	It will appear as GREY STATUS in the channel list UI if set to TRUE.

BOOL		mActiveOverride;

	If FALSE, the channel is not used in the morph result. If TRUE, it is.
	It will appear as GREY STATUS in the channel list UI if set to FALSE.

IParamBlock* cblock;

	A parameter block per channel holds it's animatable channel value. It has only 
	one entry, index 0, which holds the floating point value.

void	ResetMe();

	Delete and reset the channel. NOTE: you still have to wire in a new paramblock into 
	the morph channel. Check the MorpherView utility for example code.

float	getMemSize();

	Get a rough approximation of the number of bytes this channel takes up in memory.

void	rebuildChannel();

	Rebuild the channel using the internal values, recalculate the optimization data, etc.

void	buildFromNode( INode *node );

	Take in a node from the scene, and initialize the channel with it. This is an important
	function that is used a lot by the Morpher UI to assign the channels with actual object data.
	Most channels will start out by using this function.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class morphCache
\*===========================================================================*/

void	NukeCache();
BOOL	AreWeCached();

	The only two functions that you may find useful here are the above. The NukeCache()
	call will remove all cached data and it will be rebuilt the next time the modifier
	is refreshed (ModifyObject gets called)

	AreWeCached will return TRUE if the cache is built. FALSE if it has been nuked and
	not rebuilt yet.



/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class MorphR3
\*===========================================================================*/

morphChannel		*chanBank;

	The 100 lenth array of morphChannel classes. You can get access to any of the
	morph channels by accessing this array, ie:

	chanBank[0].mName = _T(GetString(IDS_NEWCHAN_NAME));

int		chanSel;
int		chanNum;

	These two values work together to save the position in the UI that the user
	is looking at. chanSel is the 0-9 clamped number of the button on the UI, and
	chanNum is the 0-90 clamped value that shifts the list up and down.

	For instance, if the user is looking at channel 20, using the first button:

	chanSel = 0
	chanNum = 19

	Adding the values together gets the final channel being modified:

	chanBank[chanSel+chanNum].mActive = TRUE;

	A developer shouldn't directly change chanNum - use the VScroll function to do 
	this instead

ISpinnerControl		*chanSpins[10];
ISpinnerControl		*glSpinmin,*glSpinmax;

	Spinner controls - chanSpins are the 10 spinners controlling the channel values
	for the 10 viewable channels

HWND	hwGlobalParams, hwChannelList,	hwChannelParams, hwAdvanced, hwLegend;

	The window handles for the 5 UI panels.

morphCache MC_Local;

	The local cache, and only instance of the morphCache class. See above class
	description

Tab<int>			markerIndex;
NameTab				markerName;
int					markerSel;

	Marker Management - used to add or delete items from the marker dropdown list.
	The markerIndex and markerName must syncronise properly - the Index tab contains
	the 0-90 value for the marker itself, and Name contains the name to display in the
	dropdown list. markerSel is the Id of the marker selected in the dropdown list. If
	this value is -1, no marker is selected. To add a new marker, try:


		mp->markerName.AddName("Ishani's Marker");

		int tmp;
		tmp = 35;
		mp->markerIndex.Append(1,&tmp,0);

		mp->markerSel = mp->markerName.Count()-1;
		mp->Update_channelMarkers();


	(Where mp is a valid MorphR3 pointer)

void	VScroll(int code, short int cpos );

	Used to handle scrolling, but can be used to drive the UI scroller. To move to a specific location,
	use:

	mp->VScroll(SB_THUMBPOSITION,35);

	But where 35 is the chanNum offset you require.

void	ChannelOp(int src, int targ, int flags);

	function for moving or swapping morphChannels. the flags parameter can be one of the following:

	OP_MOVE
	OP_SWAP

	and src and targ being the 0-based channel index numbers you want to use.


OTHER NOTES:

	There are also many Update_<.....> functions, which will reload and display various
	chunks of the UI. Call them to update changes as you make them to the Morpher.


/*===========================================================================*\
 |	Detailed Description:   Class M3MatDlg / M3Mat
\*===========================================================================*/

void	 UpdateMorphInfo(int upFlag);

	Called to update the information from Morpher Modifier -> Morpher Material. upFlag can be:

	UD_NORM		-- just redisplay the info
	UD_LINK		-- reconnect to the modifier, reload all information

Editable Mesh project

It is important that any changes in the Editable Mesh source,
contained in this directory, are accompanied by parallel changes in
the Edit Mesh source, contained in ..\modifier.

I've done what I can to make the source as straightforwardly parallel
as possible for Shiva (Max version 3).  Please try to maintain this
parallel structure in the code as well as the UI.

Keep the polygon count of your objects down to achieve good performance.} A complete scene with a maximum of 5, 000 to 10,000 polygons is manageable for most computers. The {\uldb\cf11 Level of Detail}{\v Level_Of_Detail__VRML_}  helper lets you manage the polygon count of objects in the scene. You can also use the 3D Studio MAX Optimize modifier to simplify objects before exporting them to VRML97. \par {\b Use primitives whenever possible.} For example, a scene containing only a sphere exports to a VRML97 file of about 400 bytes, but if you apply an edit mesh modifier and move one vertex on the sphere, the VRML97 file is about 7,400 bytes. \par {\b Use the }{\uldb\cf11 Polygon Counter}{\v Using_the_Polygon_Counter_Utility} to keep track of the number of faces in your scene. \par Call your VRML97 .wrl files from a standard HTML page and constrain the viewer to a limited window on the screen using the embed command. This decreases the number of pixels that must be rendered on every frame and makes the VRML97 environment more respon sive. Many users use high resolution (800x600 or more), so the number of pixels during rendering and navigation can be large and the video display may s low down. Frames may be dropped as the browser attempts to keep up its real-time rendering, and navigating the scene will become "chunky.\rdblquote  Use the embed command to avoid this, for example, <embed SRC=myworld.wrl WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200> \par {\b Hide faces on an object in 3D Studio MAX, then export the object.}  The hidden faces appear as a hole in the object. While the VRML97 plug-in can export hidden objects, it does not export hidden faces. Hide faces that you know will never be visible in the scene, such as the backs  of objects or the bottom faces of objects resting on a surface. \par {\b Use instances} to reduce file size for objects that have the same geometry. \par {\b Whenever you use a Mirror transform, use the Reset Transform utility immediately afterwards.}  You can also use a Normal modifier immediately followed by Unify Normals. VRML97 does not allow mirror transforms (negative scales). The Reset Transform utility modifies the data in the actual mesh object to create the mirroring effect. \par {\b Don\rquote t change 3D Studio MAX units when modeling for VRML97.} To model in meters, keep the units set to the default and use one MAX world unit as one meter.{\f5\fs24  \par }\pard\plain \s2\sb480\sa60\keepn\widctlpar \b\i\f5 Animation{\b0  \par }\pard\plain \s23\sa120\nowidctlpar \f39\fs20 {\b Beware of large file sizes when you use transform animation and coordinate-interpolated animation.}  The VRML97 plug-in exports transform animation (move, rotate, and scale), and coordinate-interpolated animation. For example, you can animate modifiers such as Taper and Bend and you can animate changing parameters, such as increasing or decreasing the r adius of a sphere.  \par {\b When scenes using the Inherit Links function are exported to VRML97, child objects always inherit their parents\rquote  transforms.}  Inverse Kinematics export correctly to VRML97 with the exception of the Inherit Links function, which determines whether child objects inherit the transforms of parent objects.  \par {\b Always use TCB controllers for VRBL animations.} These controllers provide precise control and generate the smallest possible file size. Other kinds of controllers, such as the default Bezier controller, create larger VRML97 fi les that do not perform as well. \par {\b Make sure your animations never change the face or vertex count over time.} VRML97 can not add or delete faces or vertices over time. CoordinateInterpolators support morphing a mesh only, not changing the number of vertices or faces.  \par {\b To trigger an animation that is not on an object at the top-level of the MAX linking hierarchy, use a TimeSensor helper object.}  If you trigger an animation directly from a TouchSensor or ProximitySensor, without a TimeSensor, you can animate only top-level objects. Animating from TimeSensors does not have this limitation. \par {\b Turn off the Generate Primitives toggle in the Export dialog}  if you animate the parameters of primitives (like the radius of a sphere), and want the animation exported with CoordinateInterpolators. This applies to box, sphere, cylinder and cone primitives only.{\f5\fs24  \par }\pard\plain \s2\sb480\sa60\keepn\widctlpar \b\i\f5 Materials{\b0  \par }\pard\plain \s15\sa120\nowidctlpar \f39\fs20 You can export only standard and multi/sub-object materials, and only the following components of the material: {\f5\fs24  \par }\pard\plain \s22\sa120\nowidctlpar \i\f11\fs16\cf2 #STARTBULLETBLOCK#{\i0\f5\fs24\cf0  \par }\pard\plain \s18\fi-360\li360\sa120\nowidctlpar\tx360 \f39\fs20 {\b\f1 \'b7\tab }Diffuse, ambient, and specular color \par {\b\f1 \'b7\tab }One texture map, which must be in the Diffuse channel {\f5\fs24  \par }\pard\plain \s20\li360\sa120\nowidctlpar \f39\fs20  Use JPEG or PNG format for your maps, because they are recognized by all VRML97-compliant browsers and generally create the smallest files.

If an object has a multi/sub-object material with textures, it exports as separate objects in VRML97, since VRML97 does not support more than one texture map per object.

This programming guide is divided into the following sections. Section Description Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Project WindowsMediaAudioDecoderProject Provides general information about the development environment and the tools required for developing the project. Using Windows Media Audio Decoder Library UsingtheWindowsMediaAudioDecoderLibrary Discusses how to write a generic application that makes calls to the Window Media audio decoder library. Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Sample WindowsMediaAudioDecoderSample Provides a sample application, written in C. See Also Programming Guide ProgrammingGuide Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Programming Reference WindowsMediaAudioDecoderProgrammingReference # Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Project To develop an application that calls functions exposed by the Windows Media audio decoder library, you must include the following header file declaration in your project: #include "wmaudio.h" (note that the name of the header file is different for each platform/processor) The header file Wmaudiowmaudio.h is shipped with Windows Media EPAK. For more information about the development environment and libraries required to build the application for a specific platform, see Introducing Windows Media Audio Decoder Library IntroducingWindowsMediaAudioDecoder.  See Also Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Programming Guide WindowsMediaAudioDecoderProgrammingGuide # Using the Windows Media Audio Decoder Library This section discusses how to write a generic application that calls functions exposed by the Windows Media audio decoder library. It covers the following topics: Initializing the Windows Media Audio Decoder Library InitializingtheWIndowsMeidaAudioDecoderLibrary Getting the Header Information from the Windows Media Audio FileGettingtheHeadInformationoftheWMAFile Reading the DRM License File if DRM Is EnabledReadingtheDRMLicenseFileIfDRMisenabled Converting the Windows Media Audio File into PCM DataConvertingtheWMAFileintoPCMData Writing the Converted PCM Data to the Internal MemoryWritingtheConvertedPCMDatatotheInternalMemory How the Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Works HowtheWindowsMediaAudioDecoderLibraryWorks # Initializing the Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Before converting a new Windows Media file with a .wma extension, the application must call the WMAFileDecodeInitWMAFileDecodeInit function to initialize the Windows Media audio decoder library. If it is initialized successfully, WMAFileDecodeInit returns cWMA_NoErr (one of the members of the tWMAFileStatustWMAFileStatus enumeration type). Otherwise, it returns an error value, which also is one of the members of the tWMAFileStatustWMAFileStatus enumeration type, and indicates the cause of an error during initialization. When this happens, you must quit the application. # Getting the Content Header Information of the Windows Media Audio File After the Windows Media audio decoder library is initialized, the application calls the WMAFileDecodeInfoWMAFileDecodeInfo function to retrieve the content header information from the Windows Media file with a .wma extension that is to be converted. A pointer to the tWMAFileHeadertWMAFileHeader structure that holds the content header information about the Windows Media audio file is passed into the WMAFileDecodeInfo function.  This function returns either a cWMA_NoErr value, which indicates that the content header information has been retrieved, or a cWMA_BadArgument value, which indicates that a bad argument was passed in. If cWMA_BadArgument is returned, you must quit the application. If the cWMA_NoErr value is returned, go to the next step, Reading the DRM License File if DRM Is EnabledReadingtheDRMLicenseFileIfDRMisenabled. # Reading the DRM License File if DRM Is Enabled After the content header information has been successfully retrieved from the Windows Media audio file, and if that file  is DRM-enabled, the application calls the WMAFileLicenseInitWMAFileLicenseInit function.  This function reads the DRM license, and checks the license for that particular file. The WMAFileCBGetLicenseDataWMAFileCBGetLicenseData function, which is called from the Windows Media Audio DRM decryption library, then retrieves the license.  If the Windows Media audio file is not DRM-enabled, the application skips this step. # Converting the Windows Media Audio File into PCM Data After either successfully retrieving the content header information from the Windows Media audio file if the file is DRM-disabled, or successfully retrieving the DRM license if the Windows Media audio file is DRM-enabled, the application calls the WMAFileDecodeDataWMAFileDecodeData function to convert the content into PCM data. # Writing the Converted PCM Data to the Internal Memory After successfully converting the content of a Windows Media audio file into PCM data, the application calls the WMAFileGetPCMWMAFileGetPCM function that writes the converted PCM data into internal memory. This function can be called more than once to obtain all of the samples for the frame. When the frame is completed, the number of samples written is less than the number of samples requested. # How the Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Works The following diagram shows how an application calls the functions exposed by the Windows Media audio decoder library. <P><img src="art/WMA_Playback.gif" border=0></P> See Also WMAFileDecodeDataWMAFileDecodeData WMAFileDecodeInfoWMAFileDecodeInfo WMAFileDecodeInitWMAFileDecodeInit WMAFileGetPCMWMAFileGetPCM WMAFileLicenseInitWMAFileLicenseInit Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Project WindowsMediaAudioDecoderProject Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Programming Guide WindowsMediaAudioDecoderProgrammingGuide # Windows Media Audio Decoder Library Sample The Windows Media audio decoder sample uses the Windows Media audio decoder library to convert a Windows Media audio file with DRM disabled into PCM data.

What's in this directory:

- dxt is the VC debug module, built as a debugger extension.  It gets put into
  ntbins\devkit\msvc.dll and lives on the Xbox as msvc.dll
- win32 is the same VC debug module, built to live on the host and use the
  network protocol to talk to the Xbox.  It gets built into
  ntbins\mstools\tlxbox.dll and lives in your MSVC install tree
- wintl is the host-side transport layer that talks to the dxt.  It gets put
  into ntbins\devkit\tlxbox.dll and lives in your MSVC install tree.

Most of the time you'll want to build win32 only and use that version of
tlxbox.dll.  If you want to test out debugger extensibility, you build dxt and
wintl and use that version of tlxbox.dll instead of the default one, and copy
msvc.dll over to the Xbox alongside xbdm.dll

will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC42XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC42DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.

To build, you'll need to install LocStudio from:
 \\cptoolzone\Toolbox\LocStudio\Version451a\Release\Disk1\setup.exe

KevinKi pulled this together

LeeHart cobbled this from a series of commands and various makefiles into
        something that more or less builds under build.exe

Once LocStudio is installed, copy .\LocStudio\w32msdev.dll to where LocStudio
was installed (default of %programfiles%\LocStdudio)

Development Notes:
	
1) These are my notes while writing the Xbox plug-in for VS7.  Some of this is stuff I learned while picking apart the VC6 Xbox plugin DM and the win32 VC7 DM; other
   comments are my design decisions for the VC7 plugin.
	
2) Decided to combine Transport Layer(TL) and Debug Monitor (DM) into a single plug-in.  The project lives in tlxbox and builds as dmxbox.  One of these will change,
   I haven't decided which yet.
   
3) The TL buffer management is much more complicated than it needs to be.  Most of this stems from this belief in a complicated the thread model.  This also seems to be untrue.
   There was a comment to the effect that "the dm is called on one thread, usually goes off and does work on another thread and then calls back to the TL (with tlfReply) from
   that thread.  The TL blocks the original thread until the reply."  *Maybe* this was true under VC6, where there was one global reply buffer. (It was not properly protected,
   but by luck didn't break win32 debugging.  By poor luck it did break Xbox debugging, but jlange modified their EM layer to so as to protect the buffer.)  Under VC7, this
   comment is definately untrue.  The reply buffer is now in TLS, you retrieve it by calling through a pointer to get it when you need.  If you call this function on the
   wrong thread, you get the wrong buffer.  The dang thing ought to be just a pointer to an output parameter (dare I suggest a union of all the possible reply types) passed
   into the dispatch function.  In our new DM's dispatch function, we will do just this.
   
4) So how many threads are there and what do they do?  Astonishingly, I am 98% sure that when using TLLoc for win32 debugging on VC7 there are only two threads.  The UI thread:
   you get called on this thread when the debugger is first launched.  If you hang on any of these calls, the debugger UI freezes.  The DM polling thread:  This thread polls Win32
   for DEBUG_EVENTs.  Then it translates the DEBUG_EVENT into an RTP (not sure what it stands for, but this is the "DEBUG_EVENT" of the higher portion of the debugger) and calls
   the EM.  The EM can then call you back from the thread before returning, thus the need for thread based reply buffers.  As a general rule it would seem to be a bad idea to
   call the EM from within the context of a call from the EM.  You are basically using a calling convention where parameters are passed through common memory rather than a stack.
   If the call stack gets deeper than about 3 you run a risk of stomping on return values, unless both sides are very careful about when they fill out the return value.  I wouldn't
   count on the EM being careful here.  However, the VC7 code does call the EM back with a LOAD_DLL_DEBUG_EVENT on all platforms, and a thread create on Win95.  So the EM must
   at least handle these.
   
5) I factored most of the process specific things into a CXboxProcess class.  This avoids having lots of data at global scope.  The few things that do belong at global
   scope have been placed in a DM_GLOBALS structures and referred to through a single instance, g_DmGlobals.  These few things are basically required remenants of the TL.
   
6) CXboxProcess::SetTitle and calling the debugger.  For right now we have some temporary measures for running the debugger that we need to fix on the front end:
	a) We are simply replacing NatDbgTlLoc.dll with dmxbox.dll.
	b) The executable name for debugging its local location on the development machine, and it is .exe.
	c) The working directory is the target directory on Xbox (leading x is optional).
	d) CXboxProcess::SetTitle grafts the .exe name from the exe path unto the working dir, and the replaces
	   .exe with .xbe, before calling DmSetTitle.
	e) The rational is that by not changing the Exe path, the EE can go out and find it, and then load the correct
	   symbols without needing to modify the EE to understand XBE's.
	f) The arrangement is intended to be a temporary hack to get things moving, we need to revist exactly what to do here.
	   In VC6, we modified the EE.  There will be other considerations in VS.NET, such as what the dialogs look like.

7) There is this UserTimer thing.  I think it is intended to measure execution time between breakpoints our something.  In any case, the code is obviously in various states
   of totally broken on both VS.NET and VC6.  I will not include anything like here.
   
8) DEBUG_EVENTs.  I have gone a long way down build this CDebugEventPump.  This is very similar to the existing DEQ.   This translates 
   notifications from XboxDbg notifications,  dwParam points to a structure appropriate for the notification, to DEBUG_EVENTs.  I did
   this before unpeeling the other half the onion.  The EM does actually deal with DEBUG_EVENTs. Win32 gives DEBUG_EVENTs which as I
   now explain in item 4) above get translated into RTPs for the EM.  DEBUG_EVENTs are not such a greate idea since as I found it is
   really hard to translate XboxDbg notifications into DEBUG_EVENTs.  The VC6 does it, but it is a hack; sometimes it just can't cramn
   all the information into the DEBUG_EVENT, or cannot do the translation so it stuff ever related information into fields it cannot fill
   out, and then fixes it on the other side of pulling it off the queue while translating it to an RTP anyway.
   
   So does that mean we should never bother to convert to DEBUG_EVENTs at all?  I wouldn't go that far.  There is a lot of good code
   written that uses them.  For each event type, we should look at the DEBUG_EVENT and the existing handler code.  In some cases, the
   handlers rely extensively on this being a win32 process.  In this case, we will need to rewrite the handler anyway, why not skip the
   translation and translation back.  In other cases, the handler may not need to change at all provided we can cleaning convert the XboxDbg
   notification into a DEBUG event.
   
   And another thing.  The Win32 code doesn't really have a queue (well it does, but more on that in a couple of items).  It starts up
   a thread and polls WaitForDebugEvent (a little indirectly, but that is what is happening).  For a debugger, this is kind of like a
   Windows message pump calling GetMessage.  We call it "polling", but our polls block until there is something to say. It then dispatches
   these.  In the VC6 code, the DEQ was created as a way of turning notification calls from XboxDbg into something you can poll in the same
   way.  We should consider whether this queue and an extra polling thread is necessary.  XboxDbg already has a thread associated with the
   notification session.  It call you back from this thread whenever there is an event. Why not just notify the EM from that thread? 
   
		It could be that the EM will block you for a while, and that XboxDbg won't like it very much.  I know that
		XboxDbg is OK with it on an assert, the VC6 plugin blocks the thread to stick up the assert dialog!  However,
		in that case the debuggee is stopped and definately sending stuff. If strings are coming fast and furious, and
		the EM is too slow, it might overflow XboxDbg's buffer.  In this case, it still more elegant to push back into
		XboxDbg and increase its buffer (or the tcpip socket's buffer).
   
9) So will the CDebugEventPump that I spent a day on die?  Originally, I was going to prime the CDebugEventPump to aid in connecting the debugger
   without starting up an extra launch thread.   This was a good idea, but if we kill the polling thread and use XboxDbg's thread to notify the EM,
   we won't be able to do it.  It looks like I may need to spin a thread after all.  If I do this I will not use CDebugEventPump, but something
   closer to what the VC6 plugin did.  Before creating the startup thread and before turning on the XboxDbg notification, I will create an
   XBOXDBG_NOTIFICATION struct that contains the notification code and a union of all things dwParam can point to.  I will create an STL
   queue<XBOXDBG_NOTIFICATION> and populate it with all the notifications that need to be sent at start up.  Then I will create the startup
   thread, and pass it the queue<XBOXDBG_NOTIFICATION>.  It will process the queue by dispatch notifications through the callback that XboxDbg
   notifications will go through.  After processing the last one, it will delete the queue, and turn on the real Xbox notifications.  Then the
   starup thread will exit.

10) What is the queue used by the VC7 DM.  It is a continue event queue.  It is used for two things.  While single stepping or when stopped at a
	breakpoint the user may hit go, or choose to termiante the process or something else like that.  The EM will tell us about when we are processing
	a notification, so we queue until we are done with the notification.  So basically, everytime we finish processing a really notification we go and
	process that queue.  We can still utilize XboxDbg's thread.  Whenever we finish processing a notification, we just process this queue before
	returning.
