s with the NtMapViewOfSection function: NTSTATUS NtMapViewOfSection( IN HANDLE SectionHandle,  IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN ULONG ZeroBits,  IN ULONG CommitSize,  IN OUT PLARGE_INTEGER SectionOffset OPTIONAL,  IN OUT PULONG ViewSize,  IN SECTION_INHERIT InheritDisposition, IN ULONG AllocationType,  IN ULONG Protect Parameters: SectionHandle - An open handle to a section object. ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the view. If the initial value of this argument is not NULL, then the view is allocated starting at the specified virtual address must be a multiple of the allocation granularity. If the initial value of this argument is NULL, then the operating system determines where to allocate the view using the information specified by the ZeroBits argument value and the section allocation attributes (i.e., SEC_BASED). ZeroBits - The number of high-order address bits that must be zero in the base address of the section view. The value of this argument must be less than 21 and is only used when the operating system determines where to allocate the view (i.e., when BaseAddress is NULL). CommitSize - The size of the initially committed region of the view in bytes. CommitSize is only meaningful for page-file backed sections, mapped sections, both data and image are always committed at section creation time and is ignored for mapped files.  This value is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary. SectionOffset - Optionally supplies a pointer to the offset from the beginning of the section to the view in bytes. This value must be a multiple of allocation granularity.  If the section was created with the SEC_IMAGE, this argument must be NULL. ViewSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the view. If the value of this argument is zero, then a view of the section will be mapped starting at the specified section offset and continuing to the end of the section. Otherwise the initial value of this argument specifies the size of the view in bytes and is rounded up to the next host page size boundary. InheritDisposition - A value that specifies how the view is to be shared by a child process created with a create process operation. InheritDisposition Values ViewCopy - Inherit view and copy the committed pages to a child process using the current protection value. (If the underlying section is not writable, then a copy of the pages need not actually be made.) ViewShare - Inherit view and share a single copy of the committed pages with a child process using the current protection value. ViewUnmap - Do not map the view into a child process. AllocationType - A set of flags that describes the type of allocation that is to be performed for the specified region of pages. AllocationType Flags MEM_TOP_DOWN - The specified region is to be allocated from the highest portion of the address space possible based on the ZeroBits argument. MEM_LARGE_PAGES - Only valid with physical memory mappings.  The specified view should be mapped with the largest page size possible. MEM_DOS_LIM - Only valid on x86, provided for DOS/VDM compatibility.  Allows views to be mapped on 4kb boundaries rather than allocation granularity. Protect - The protection desired for the region of initially committed pages. Protect Values PAGE_NOACCESS - No access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read, write, or execute the committed region results in an access violation (i.e., a GP fault). PAGE_READONLY - Read access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to write or execute the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_READWRITE - Read, and write access to the region of committed pages are allowed. If write access to the underlying section is allowed, then a single copy of the pages is shared. Otherwise the pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_WRITECOPY - Read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_EXECUTE - Execute access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read or write the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READ - Execute and read access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  An attempt to write the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE - Execute, read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY - Read, execute and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_GUARD - Protect the page with the underlying page protection, however, access to the region causes a "guard page entered" condition to be raised in the subject process.  This value is only valid with one of the page protections except PAGE_NOACCESS. Mapping a view of a section into the virtual address space of a subject process causes a region of the virtual address space to be reserved and, optionally, committed.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATION access to the subject process, and the following access to the section: Protect Value Section Access Required PAGE_NOACCESS SECTION_MAP_READ PAGE_READONLY SECTION_MAP_READ PAGE_READWRITE SECTION_MAP_WRITE, SECTION_MAP_READ PAGE_WRITECOPY SECTION_MAP_READ PAGE_EXECUTE SECTION_MAP_EXECUTE PAGE_EXECUTE_READ SECTION_MAP_READ, SECTION_MAP_EXECUTE PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE SECTION_MAP_EXECUTE, SECTION_MAP_READ,  SECTION_MAP_WRITE PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY SECTION_MAP_EXECUTE, SECTION_MAP_READ In addition to the section access, the specified page protection must be compatible with the SectionPageProtection specified when the section was created. Desired View Protection Section Protection Required PAGE_NOACCESS PAGE_READONLY Any except PAGE_NOACCESS and  PAGE_EXECUTE PAGE_READWRITE PAGE_READWRITE,  PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE PAGE_WRITECOPY Any except PAGE_NOACCESS and  PAGE_EXECUTE PAGE_EXECUTE PAGE_EXECUTE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,  PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE,  PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY PAGE_EXECUTE_READ PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,  PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE,  PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,  PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE,  PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY The view size and section offset determine the region of the section that is mapped into the virtual address space of the subject process. The commit size determines how much of the view is initially committed. The committed pages, if any, start at the beginning of the view and extend upward. Several different views of a section can be concurrently mapped into the virtual address space of a process. Likewise, several different views of a section can also be concurrently mapped into the virtual address space of several processes. If the operating system determines the virtual address allocation for the view (i.e. BaseAddress is NULL) and the section is based, then the region chosen is the one that was reserved when the section was created. If the operating system determines the virtual address allocation for the view and the section is not based, then the allocation is such that the specified number of high-order address bits are zero in the base address of the view. This capability is provided so that applications that use address bits for tag bits need not explicitly manage the virtual-address-space allocation themselves. If the operating system determines the virtual address allocation for the view, the ViewSize is zero, and the complete section has been mapped before, the returned based address will be the base address where the complete section is already mapped.  This allows library routines to map complete views of sections without having to determine if the section has been previously mapped. If the operating system does not determine the virtual address allocation (i.e., BaseAddress is not null), then an attempt is made to map the view starting at the specified base address and extending upward. If any page within this region is already reserved or committed, then the view cannot be mapped. Committed pages are initialized with the specified protection value which must be compatible with the granted access to the section. Reserved pages are given a protection value of no access. Any attempt to access these pages results in an access violation unless another sharer has previously committed the pages. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_NO_QUOTA - Error, insufficient quota to create the specified section. STATUS_NO_MEMORY - Error, insufficient virtual memory to map specified view. STATUS_SECTION_PROTECTION - Error, the specified protection is not compatible with the underlying section protection. STATUS_INVALID_PAGE_PROTECTION - Error, an invalid page protection was specified. STATUS_CONFLICTING_ADDRESSES - Error, the specified address range conflicts with an existing address range. 2.4 Extend Size Of Section An existing section which maps a data file can be extended with the NtExtendSection function: NTSTATUS  NtExtendSection ( IN HANDLE SectionHandle, IN OUT PLARGE_INTEGER NewSectionSize Parameters: SectionHandle - An open handle to a section object that maps a data file.  SECTION_EXTEND_SIZE access to this handle is required. NewSectionSize - A pointer to a variable that supplies the new size for the section.  This variable receives the new size of the section.  If the specified size is less than the current size, this variable receives the current size. The extend section service allows a user to extend the size of a section that maps a data file.  If the current size of the section is greater than the specified size, the section size is not changed and the current section size is written to the NewSectionSize. If the current section size is less than the new section size, the current file allocation size is checked and if the file allocation size is greater than the specified new section size, the section is extended. If, however, the file allocation size is less than the specified section size, an attempt is made to set the file allocation size to the specified new section size.  If this succeeds, the section is extended.  If this fails the section size is unchanged and the returned status indicates why the file allocation could not be increased. 2.5 Unmap View Of Section A view of a section can be unmapped from the virtual address space of a subject process with the NtUnmapViewOfSection function: NTSTATUS  NtUnmapViewOfSection( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN PVOID BaseAddress Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A virtual address within the view which is to be unmapped. The entire view of the section specified by the base address parameter is unmapped from the virtual address space of the specified process. The base address argument may be any virtual address within the view.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATION access to the subject process. The virtual address region occupied by the view is no longer reserved and is available to map other views or private pages. If the view was also the last reference to the underlying section (i.e., no open handles exist to the section object), then all committed pages in the section are decommitted and the section is deleted. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  2.6 Allocate Virtual Memory A region of pages within the virtual address space of a subject process can be reserved and/or committed with the NtAllocateVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtAllocateVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN ULONG ZeroBits,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize,  IN ULONG AllocationType,  IN ULONG Protect Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the allocated region of pages. If the initial value of this argument is not NULL and the memory is being reserved, then the region is allocated starting at the specified virtual address rounded down to the next 64K byte boundary.  If the memory is already reserved and is being committed, this value is rounded down to a host-page-size boundary.  If the initial value of this argument is NULL, then the operating system determines where to allocate the region. ZeroBits - The number of high-order address bits that must be zero in the base address of the section view. The value of this argument must be less than 21 and is only used when the operating system determines where to allocate the view (i.e., when BaseAddress is NULL). RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the allocated region of pages. The initial value of this argument specifies the size in bytes of the region and is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary. AllocationType - A set of flags that describes the type of allocation that is to be performed for the specified region of pages.  One of MEM_COMMIT or MEM_RESERVED is required, both are acceptable (i.e., MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE). AllocationType Flags MEM_COMMIT - The specified region of pages is to be committed. MEM_RESERVE - The specified region of pages is to be reserved. MEM_TOP_DOWN - The specified region is to be allocated from the highest portion of the address space possible based on the ZeroBits argument. Protect - The protection desired for the committed region of pages. Protect Values PAGE_NOACCESS - No access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read, write, or execute the committed region results in an access violation (i.e., a GP fault). PAGE_READONLY - Read access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to write or execute the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_READWRITE - Read and write access to the committed region of pages is allowed. If write access to the underlying section is allowed, then a single copy of the pages are shared. Otherwise, the pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_WRITECOPY - Read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_EXECUTE - Execute access to the committed region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read or write the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READ - Execute and read access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  An attempt to write the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE - Execute, read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY - Read, execute, and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_GUARD - Protect the page with the underlying page protection, however, access to the region causes a "guard page entered" condition to be raised in the subject process.  This value is only valid with one of the page protections except PAGE_NOACCESS. PAGE_NOCACHE - Disable the placement of committed pages into the data cache.  This is only valid for pages which are not contained within a view of a section.  For pages which are contained in a view of a section, the nocache attribute may be specified when the section is created, in which case it cannot be changed. This value is only valid with one of the page protections except PAGE_NOACCESS. This function can be used to commit a region of previously reserved pages (i.e., from a mapped view or a previous call to this function), to reserve a region of private pages, or to reserve and commit a region of private pages.  This function also can be used to create a sparse population of committed private or mapped pages.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATION access to the subject process. If the initial value of the base address parameter is NULL, then the operating system allocates a region of private pages large enough to fulfill the specified allocation request from the virtual address space of the subject process. The base address of this region is returned in the base address parameter. Private pages are given an inherit disposition of equivalent to ViewShare. Process address map entries are scanned from the base address upward until the entire range of pages can be allocated or a failure occurs.  If the entire range cannot be allocated, an appropriate status value is returned and no pages are mapped. Each page in the process virtual address space is either private or mapped into a view of a section.  Private pages can be in one of three states: Free - Not committed or reserved, and inaccessible Committed - Allocated backing storage with access controlled by a protection code Reserved - Reserved, not committed, and inaccessible Pages that are mapped into a view of a section can be in one of two states: Committed - Allocated backing storage with access controlled by a protection code Reserved - Reserved, not committed, and inaccessible, but can be auto-committed if an access to the page is attempted and the page has already been committed in the section mapped by the view (i.e., the page has been committed by another sharer of the section) As each page is considered for allocation, its state and whether it is a private or mapped page is determined. Private pages are handled as follows: Free - A private page that is free can be reserved and/or committed. Committed - A private page that is already committed is left unchanged (i.e., it is still committed and its protection is not changed).  Reserved - A private page that is reserved can be committed.  An attempt to reserve a page already in the reserved state has no effect. Pages that are mapped into a view of a section are handled as follows: Committed  - A mapped page that is already committed cannot be changed to reserved.  A shared page that is already committed is unchanged, however, in certain cases it's protection may be changed.  This is due to the fact that shared pages, even though committed, may not be active in the process and hence have the original protection of the mapping.  In committing the page the mapping state is not checked on a page by page basis. Reserved - A mapped page that is reserved can be committed. The protection value applied to committed pages that are contained within a mapped view of a section must be compatible with the access granted to the underlying section. Note that the underlying protection of the section does not change, only the specified pages contained in the process's view.   Any protection value can be applied to committed private pages. Reserved pages are given a protection value of no access. Pages that are backed by a paging file are committed as demand-zero pages (i.e., the first attempt to read or write the page causes a page of zeros to be created).  Pages that are backed by a data file are committed such that they map pages of the data file. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_INVALID_PAGE_PROTECTION - Error, an invalid page protection was specified. STATUS_CONFLICTING_ADDRESSES - Error, the specified address range conflicts with an existing address range. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  2.7 Free Virtual Memory A region of pages within the virtual address space of a subject process can be decommitted and/or released with the NtFreeVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtFreeVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize,  IN ULONG FreeType Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the region of pages to be freed. The initial value of this argument is the base address of the region of pages to be freed. This value is rounded down to the next host-page-address boundary. RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the freed region of pages. The initial value of this argument is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary.  If this value is zero and the BaseAddress is the starting address of the allocated region, the complete range of pages  allocated together is freed or decommitted. FreeType - A set of flags that describes the type of free that is to be performed for the specified region of pages. One of the following: FreeType Flags MEM_DECOMMIT - The specified region of pages is to be decommitted. MEM_RELEASE - The specified region of pages is to be released. This function can be used to decommit a region of previously committed pages (i.e. from a mapped view or from an allocation of virtual memory), to release a region of previously reserved private pages, and to decommit and release a region of previously committed private pages.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATION access to the subject process. Process address map entries are scanned from the base address upward until the entire range of pages can be freed or until a failure occurs. If the entire range cannot be freed, an appropriate status value is returned and no pages are freed. Each page in the process virtual address space is either private or mapped into a view of a section.  Private pages can be in one of three states: Free - Not committed or reserved and inaccessible Committed - Allocated backing storage with access controlled by a protection code Reserved - Reserved, not committed, and inaccessible Pages that are mapped into a view of a section can be in one of two states: Committed - Allocated backing storage with access controlled by a protection code Reserved - Reserved, not committed, and inaccessible, but can be auto-committed if an access to the page is attempted and the page has already been committed in the section mapped by the view (i tc ", the page has been committed by another sharer of the section)" \f E **************LOU - I set hidden the above text because it unnecessarily repeats something you already said and it's confusing.******** As each page is considered for deallocation, its state and whether it is a private or mapped page is determined.  Private pages are handled as follows: Free - A private page that is free cannot be released or decommitted. Committed - A private page that is committed can be released and/or decommitted. Reserved - A private page that is reserved can be released or decommitted.  Decommitting a reserved page leaves the page in the reserved state. Pages that are mapped into a view of a section are handled as follows: Committed - A mapped page that is committed cannot be decommitted or released.  Reserved - A mapped page that is reserved cannot be decommitted or released. If the desired type of free is allowed for the specified RegionSize, then page attributes are established as necessary in the process address map, and the current length of the freed region is updated. If the desired type of free cannot be performed on the entire range, then an appropriate status value is returned and none of the specified region is freed. Decommitting a private page causes the backing storage for the page to be released to the appropriate paging file and the address map entry for the corresponding page to be returned to the reserved state. Decommitted and released pages are given a protection value of no access. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_UNABLE_TO_FREE_VM - Error, the specified virtual memory could not be released.  This could be caused by the virtual memory being a system structure (TEB or PEB) or being part of a mapped view, or the specified size larger than the original allocation. STATUS_VM_NOT_AT_BASE - Error, the region size was specified as zero, but the starting address was not the beginning of the allocation. STATUS_MEMORY_NOT_ALLOCATED - Error, no memory as been allocated at the specified base address. 2.8 Read Virtual Memory Data can be read from the address space of another process with the NtReadVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtReadVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN PVOID BaseAddress,  OUT PVOID Buffer, IN ULONG BufferSize, OUT PULONG NumberOfBytesRead OPTIONAL Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - The base address in the specified process of the region of pages to be read. Buffer - The address of a buffer that receives the contents from the specified process address space. BufferSize - The requested number of bytes to read from the specified process. NumberOfBytesRead - Receives the actual number of bytes transferred into the specified buffer. This function reads data from the base address in the specified process and places the data in the specified buffer.  The NtReadVirtualMemory function probes both the input and the output buffers before any bytes are copied.  If either the Buffer fails a probe for write, or the BaseAddress fails a probe for read, the function returns an error and the NumberOfBytesRead parameter is returned as zero. If the probe operations are successful, an attempt is made to copy the number of bytes specified in BufferSize.  The NumberOfBytesRead parameter returns the actual number of bytes copied from the specified process into the buffer.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_READ access to the subject process. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_PARTIAL_COPY - Warning, due to protection conflicts not all the requested bytes could be copied. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION - Error, one of the memory regions was not completely accessible. 2.9 Write Virtual Memory Data can be written to the address space of another process with the NtWriteVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtWriteVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, OUT PVOID BaseAddress,  IN PVOID Buffer, IN ULONG BufferSize, OUT PULONG NumberOfBytesWritten OPTIONAL Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - The base address in the specified process of the region of pages to be written. Buffer - The address of a buffer that contains the contents to be written into the specified process address space. BufferSize - The requested number of bytes to write into the specified process. NumberOfBytesWritten - Receives the actual number of bytes transferred into the specified address space. This function writes data from the specified buffer in the current process to the specified base address in the specified process. The NtWriteVirtualMemory function probes both the input and the output buffers before any bytes are copied.  If either the Buffer fails a probe for read, or the BaseAddress fails a probe for write, the function returns an error and the NumberOfBytesRead parameter is returned as zero. If the probe operations are successful,  An attempt is made to copy the number of bytes specified in BufferSize.  The NumberOfBytesWritten parameter returns the actual number of bytes copied from the buffer to the specified process.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_WRITE access to the subject process. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_PARTIAL_COPY - Warning, due to access violations not all the requested bytes could be copied. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION - Error, one of the memory regions was not completely accessible. 2.10 Flush Virtual Memory A region of pages within the virtual address space of a subject process can be forced to be written back into the corresponding data file (if they have been modified since they were last written) with the NtFlushVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtFlushVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize, OUT PIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatus Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the region of pages to flush. The initial value of this argument is the base address of the region of pages to flush. This value is rounded down to the next host-page-address boundary. RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the flushed region of pages. The initial value of this argument is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary.  If the RegionSize is specified as 0, the range from the base address until the last address mapped in this view is flushed. IoStatus - A pointer to an I/O status block that receives the I/O status from the last page written. Process address map entries are scanned from the base address upward until the entire specified range of pages has been flushed. The actual size of the flushed region and an appropriate status value are returned.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATE access to the subject process. As each page is considered for flushing, its state is determined. If the page is committed, mapped into a view of a section that is backed by a data file, and has been modified in memory but not yet written back into the file, then a write of the modified page is initiated. Otherwise, no operation is performed on the page. This function can be used to ensure that a consistent state of the data within a file is maintained in the presence of various sequences of updates (e.g., forced writes of log pages, etc.). If an I/O error occurs while writing pages, the RegionSize contains the starting virtual address of the write which failed, and the IoStatus contains the failure status. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  Any errors possible from an NtWriteFile service. 2.11 Lock Virtual Memory A region of pages within the virtual address space of a subject process can be locked for process residency and/or system residency with the NtLockVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtLockVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize,  IN ULONG MapType Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the region of pages to lock. The initial value of this argument is the base address of the region of pages to lock. This value is rounded down to the next host-page-address boundary. RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that receives the actual size in bytes of the locked region of pages. The initial value of this argument is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary. MapType - The map type flags. MapType Flags MAP_PROCESS - Process residency MAP_SYSTEM - System residency Locking a region of pages in an address map causes the residency attributes of the corresponding pages to be set such that they are not eligible for paging. Locking a page for system residency causes the page to remain memory resident until it is explicitly unlocked. A special privilege is required in a server system to lock a page for system residency. Locking a page for process residency causes the page to remain memory resident while the subject process is a member of the balance set (i.e., the set of processes that are actively being considered for execution). Note that changing the protection of a locked page to PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD causes the page to become unlocked.  In addition, locked pages are not inherited as locked, they are unlocked in the new process. If the entire RegionSize cannot be locked, an appropriate status code is returned and none of the pages is locked.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATE access to the subject process. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_WAS_LOCKED - Warning, at least one of the pages in the specified region was already locked. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_NO_QUOTA - Error, insufficient quota to lock the specified region. 2.12 Unlock Virtual Memory A region of pages within the virtual address space of a subject process can be unlocked from process residency and/or system residency with the NtUnlockVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtUnlockVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize,  IN ULONG MapType Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the region of pages to unlock. The initial value of this argument is the base address of the region of pages to unlock. This value is rounded down to the next host-page-address boundary. RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that receives the actual size in bytes of the unlocked region of pages. The initial value of this argument is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary. MapType - The map type flags. MapType Flags MAP_PROCESS - Process residency MAP_SYSTEM - System residency Unlocking a region of pages causes the residency attributes of the corresponding pages to be set such that they are eligible for paging. Unlocking a process-resident page causes the page to become pageable until it is explicitly locked. Unlocking a system-resident page causes the page to become pageable until it is explicitly locked. A special privilege is required in a server system to unlock a system-resident page. If the entire RegionSize cannot be unlocked, an appropriate status code is returned and none of the pages is unlocked.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATE access to the subject process. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  2.13 Protect Virtual Memory The protection on a region of committed pages within the virtual address space of the subject process can be changed with the NtProtectVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtProtectVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN OUT PVOID *BaseAddress,  IN OUT PULONG RegionSize,  IN ULONG NewProtect,  OUT PULONG OldProtect Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object. BaseAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual base address of the protected region of pages.  The initial value of this argument is rounded down to the next host-page-address boundary. RegionSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the protected region of pages. The initial value of this argument is rounded up to the next host-page-size boundary. NewProtect - The new protection desired for the specified region of pages. NewProtect Values PAGE_NOACCESS - No access to the specified region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read, write, or execute the specified region results in an access violation (i.e., a GP fault). PAGE_READONLY - Read-access to the specified region of pages is allowed. An attempt to execute or write the specified region results in an access violation. PAGE_READWRITE - Read and write access to the specified region of pages is allowed. If write access to the underlying section is allowed, then a single copy of the pages are shared. Otherwise, the pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_WRITECOPY - Read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write.  This value may only be specified for an address ranges which is within a mapped view of a section. PAGE_EXECUTE - Execute access to the specified region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read or write the specified region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READ - Execute and read access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  An attempt to write the committed region results in an access violation. PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE - Execute, read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY - Read, execute, and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed.  The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. This value may only be specified for an address ranges which is within a mapped view of a section. PAGE_GUARD - Protect the page with the underlying page protection, however, access to the region causes a "guard page entered" condition to be raised in the subject process.  This value is only valid with one of the page protections except PAGE_NOACCESS. PAGE_NOCACHE - Disable the placement of committed pages into the data cache.  This value is only valid when specified in combination with one of the above underlying page protections with the exception of PAGE_NOACCESS, e.g., (PAGE_NOCACHE | PAGE_READWRITE). The PAGE_NOCACHE attribute may not be specified on an address range which is within a mapped view of a section. OldProtect - A pointer to a variable that will receive the old protection of the first page within the specified region of pages. Setting the protection on a range of pages causes the old protection value to be replaced by a new protection value. The protection value can only be set on committed pages.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_VM_OPERATE access to the subject process. Note that setting page protections to PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD on a page which is locked in memory or locked in the process causes the locked page to become unlocked. Setting the protection value to PAGE_GUARD causes guard pages to be established. If an access to a guard page is attempted, then the protection of the accessed page to be set to its declared access, and "guard page entered" condition is raised.  This capability is intended to provide automatic stack checking, but can also be used to separate other data structures where appropriate. As each page is considered for protecting, its state is determined. If the state of the page is not committed, the page is reserved and cannot be auto-committed, or the page is contained within a mapped view of a section and the granted access to the section is incompatible with the new protection, then an appropriate status value is returned and none of the pages in the specified region is modified. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_WAS_UNLOCKED - Warning, at least one of the pages in the specified region was unlocked due to a page protection of PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_INVALID_PAGE_PROTECTION - Error, an invalid page protection was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  STATUS_NOT_COMMITTED - Error, some pages within the range are not committed. STATUS_IS_WRITECOPY - Warning, the protection of the region was set to PAGE_WRITECOPY due to the underlying nature of the section. 2.14 Query Virtual Memory Information about a range of pages within the virtual address space of the subject process can be obtained with the NtQueryVirtualMemory function: NTSTATUS NtQueryVirtualMemory( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN PVOID BaseAddress,  IN MEMORY_INFORMATION_CLASS MemoryInformationClass, OUT PVOID MemoryInformation, IN ULONG MemoryInformationLength, OUT PULONG ReturnLength OPTIONAL Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object.

PAGE_READONLY - Read-access to the region of pages is allowed. An attempt to execute or write within the region results in an access violation. PAGE_READWRITE - Read and write access to the region of pages is allowed. If write access to the underlying section is allowed, then a single copy of the pages are shared. Otherwise, the pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_WRITECOPY - Read and write access to the region of committed pages is allowed. The pages are shared read-only/copy-on-write. PAGE_EXECUTE - Execute access to the region of pages is allowed. An attempt to read or write within the region results in an access violation.

This function provides the capability to determine the state, protection, and type of a region of pages within the virtual address space of the subject process.  The issuing process must have PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION access to the subject process. The state of the first page within the region is determined  and then subsequent entries in the process address map are scanned from the base address upward until either the entire range of pages has been scanned or until a page with a nonmatching set of attributes is encountered. The region attributes, the length of the region of pages with matching attributes, and an appropriate status value are returned.

This value must be greater than or equal to the InitialSize. Priority - Supplies the relative priority of the paging file with zero being the lowest priority and 0xFFFFFFFF being the highest priority.  Page file space on paging files is searched for based on the priority of each paging file. At least 8 paging files may be created.  The modified page writer attempts to write pages to all specified paging file simultaneously, therefore, for maximum performance, each paging file should reside on a separate disk drive. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. Errors resulting from attempting to open, extend, or truncate the specified file. 2.17 Flush Instruction Cache The instruction cache for a specific process can be flushed with the NtFlushInstructionCache function: NTSTATUS NtFlushInstructionCache ( IN HANDLE ProcessHandle, IN PVOID BaseAddress OPTIONAL, IN ULONG Length Parameters: ProcessHandle - An open handle to a process object.

Errors resulting from referencing the specified process handle. 2.18 Flush Write Buffer The write buffers are flushed with the NtFlushWriteBuffer function: NTSTATUS NtFlushWriteBuffer ( This routine flushes the write buffer on the current processor.  On processors without write buffers no action is taken. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. 2.19 Close Handle An open handle to any object can be closed with the NtClose function: NTSTATUS NtClose( IN HANDLE Handle Parameters: Handle - An open handle to an object. This is a generic function and can be used to close an open handle to any object. Closing an open handle to an object causes the reference count of the associated object to be decremented. If the resultant count is zero (i.e., there are no other references to the section), then the object is deleted. If the resultant count is one, the object has a name, and the object is temporary, then an attempt is made to delete the object by removing its name from the appropriate object directory. (Note that this operation may fail if another sharer manages to open the object before the name can be deleted, i.e., the removal of the name is conditional.) Closing a handle to a section object causes all modified pages to be written to the associated file, if the section is backed by a data file. After a close operation, the specified section handle is no longer valid. The following status values may be returned by the function: STATUS_NORMAL - Normal, successful completion. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER - Error, an invalid parameter was specified. STATUS_NO_ACCESS - Error, access denied to specified object.  Revision History: Revision 1.3, January 4, 1989 Add section that describes the difference between this proposal and the proposal included in the IBM IPFS for Cruiser. Drop expand stack and allow set protection to establish a guard region. Accessing a guard region causes the corresponding page to be turned into a read/write page and a guard page exception to be raised. Define all API functions as returning a status value that determines the success or failure of the operation. Use the words "commit" and "reserve" when referring to virtual address space allocation. Add flags argument to allocate and free virtual memory which signifies whether the commitment and/or reservation of the specified region is to be changed. This allows a region of private pages to be reserved without creating any kind of memory object. Correct definition of giveable and gettable sections so they are temporary and mapped at a fixed address in the virtual address space of each process. Correct definition of tiled to mean that the preferred mapping of the section is within the first 512mb of the virtual address space of a process. Change give and get section to work with a virtual address rather than a section handle. Add function to query a region of virtual memory. Clear up confusion about protection types by defining types to be no access, execute-only, read-only, read/write, and guard region. Drop section offset parameter on create section operation which allows any number of section to be backed by the same data file. If no ACL is specified for an object, then use a process default ACL. Change close section handle to be a generic function that closes any type of handle. More clearly define what permanent objects are and how they are deleted. Revision 2.0, February 28, 1989 Changed format of calls to match the Windows NT coding guidelines. Revision 2.1, March 16, 1989 Changed format of calls to match the new Windows NT coding guidelines. Added ProcessHandle argument create operations which operated on the address space. Change Fork attribute to Inherit. Removed giveable and gettable attributes and replaced them with the based attribute. Eliminated NtGetSection and NtGiveSection services. Changed semantics of services that change virtual memory attributes on a range of pages to either change the total specified range or fail and change none of the range.  This matches OS/2 behavior. Added OBJ_EXCLUSIVE and OBJ_SYSTEM_TABLE flags to handle attributes in create section. Added handle attributes to OpenSection service. Enhanced map view to recognize multiple mappings of the same complete section and return the base address in subsequent mappings. Changed FreeVirtualMemory to not allow previously committed shared pages to be decommitted.  This matches the OS/2 behavior. Changed lock and unlock virtual memory to talk about system and process residency rather than system and process address maps. Add zero bits parameter to NtAllocateVirtualMemory. Add NtReadVirtualMemory function. Add NtWriteVirtualMemory function. Add error return values. Revision 2.2, May 9, 1989 Fix typos and minor inconsistencies. Revision 2.3, August 7, 1989 Add SEC_IMAGE option to NtCreateSection. Add PAG_NOCACHE option to the protection values. Revision 2.4, September 7, 1989 Change names of PAG_READ, PAG_READWRITE, PAG_EXECUTE, PAG_NOACCESS, PAGE_NOCACHE, PAG_GUARD to PAGE_READ, etc. Change names of PAG_COMMIT, PAG_RESERVE, PAG_RELEASE, PAG_DECOMMIT, PAG_PRIVATE, PAG_MAPPED, to MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, etc. Changed NtMapViewOfSection to have AllocationType parameter and changed the type of InheritDisposition from ULONG to SECITON_INHERIT. Added MEM_TOP_DOWN to NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtMapViewOfSection. Changed BaseAddress from an IN to an IN OUT in NtFreeVirtualMemory, NtProtectVirtualMemory, NtLockVirtualMemoryh and NtUnlockVirtualMemory. Added BaseAddress field to MEMORYBASICINFO type. Added PAGE_WRITECOPY protection to NtMapViewOfSection, NtProtectVirtualMemory, and NtQueryVirtualMemory. Added note to NtProtectVirtualMemory indicating that changing a locked page to PAGE_NOACCESS causes the page to be unlocked. Added note to NtLockVirtualMemory to indicate that locked pages are not locked in a process which inherits the memory. Changed SectionOffset in NtMapViewOfSection to IN OUT. Revision 2.5, October 23, 1989 Add PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE and PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY. Change semantic of PAGE_GUARD to be similar to PAGE_NOACCESS, but instead of an "access violation" being raised, the page protection is changed to its declared protection and a "guard page entered" exception is raised.  Like PAGE_NOACCESS, guard pages unlocked locked pages. Added SectionPageProtection argument to NtCreateSection. Added SEC_NOCACHE attribute to NtCreateSection. Made SetionOffset optional for NtMapViewOfSection and changed its allocation from host page size, to system allocation granularity (64k). Changed SEC_COPY, SEC_SHARE, SEC_UNMAP to ViewCopy, ViewShare, ViewUnmap in NtMapViewOfSection. Removed PAGE_NOCACHE option from NtMapViewOfSection. Added PAGE_GUARD option to NtMapViewOfSection. Added PAGE_GUARD option to NtAllocateVirtualMemory. Clarified PAGE_NOCACHE option in NtAllocateVirtualMemory. Changed region size of zero to operate on complete range in NtFreeVirtualMemory.

Described the type of access required on the section and process handles for various virtual memory services. Revision 2.8, February 8, 1990 Changed NtReadVirtualMemory to have OUT on the buffer argument rather than IN. Changed NtWriteVirtualMemory to have OUT on the base address argument rather than IN. Changed both NtReadVirtualMemory and NtWriteVirtualMemory to remove the base address rounding down to the host page size. Removed PAGE_NOACCESS and PAGE_GUARD as valid page protections when creating a section. PAGE_NOACCESS may not be specified in combination with PAGE_GUARD or PAGE_NOCACHE. Removed STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL. Added status's of STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS and STATUS_INFO_LENGHT_MISMATCH to query functions. Disallow the combination of Commit and Release to NtFreeVirtualMemory. Add STATUS_NOT_IMAGE to query vm and create section. Add section on page file quota and commitment. Clarify protection rules in MapViewOfSection. Don't allow protection of PAGE_WRITECOPY or PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY on address ranges not mapping a view of a section. Don't allow a protection of PAGE_NOCACHE on address ranges mapping a view of a section. Revision 2.9, March 9, 1990 Added the following status values to various calls: STATUS_SECTION_TOO_BIG and STATUS_CONFLICTING_ADDRESS. Changed DesiredAccess to type ACCESS_MASK. When SEC_IMAGE is specified in NtCreateSection only accept SEC_BASED with it. Limit MaximumSize in NtCreateSection to 0xFFFEFFFF. Removed ViewCopy from NtMapViewOfSection. Revision 3.0, May 31, 1990 Added the NtExtendSection service. Added SECTION_EXTEND_SIZE access. In create section SEC_COMMIT is only meaningful for page file backed sections. Changed SectionSize parameter to type PLARGE_INTEGER in NtCreateSection. Changed description of MaximumSize parameter in NtCreateSection. Changed SectionOffset parameter to type PLARGE_INTEGER in NtMapViewOfSection. Added NtCreatePagingFile routine. Added NtFlushInstructionCache routine. Added NtFlushWriteBuffer routine. Changed NtFreeVirtualMemory to require the base address to be the start of the region if the region size is specified as zero. Added more status codes to NtFreeVirtualMemory. Revision 3.1, October 4, 1990 Added STATUS_NOT_COMMITTED to NtProtectVirtualMemory. Added MEM_IMAGE as another type to NtQueryVirtualMemory. Revision 3.2, January 24, 1991 Added SECTION_EXTEND_SIZE to NtOpenSection. Clarified that SECTION_WRITE access also grants read access. Clarified that private pages are inherited on a fork operation. Changed parameters to NtCreatePagingFile. Clarified NtReadVirtualMemory and NtWriteVirtualMemory to state that the buffers are probed before any bytes are copied. Revision 3.3, April 25, 1991 For NtFlushVirtualMemory if RegionSize is zero, flush from the base address to the end of the mapped view. Revision 4.0, April 28, 1993 Reflect Windows NT version 3.1. Remove all references to OS/2. Change references to 64k alignment to Allocation Granularity as this alignment is hardware architecture dependent. Changed description of SEC_BASED. Added MEM_LARGE_PAGES and MEM_DOS_LIM to NtMapViewOfSection. Changed NtAllocateVirtualMemory to reflect the fact that committed pages may be committed.

Overview This specification discusses memory management issues as related to the Intel 860.  The Intel 386/486 architecture has a similar PTE format and the software PTE definition is identical between the two architectures. The memory management subsystem is responsible for the mapping of physical memory into the virtual address space of a process.  The memory management functions are implemented by several distinct pieces of the executive.  The translation-not-valid fault handler (pager) is the exception service routine that responds to page faults and makes virtual pages resident on behalf of a process.  The modified page writer is responsible for writing modified pages to the appropriate backing store so the physical pages can be reused.  The balance set manager is responsible for reducing process working set sizes to gain more pages of memory. Executive routines and system services are provided to allow processes some degree of control over the behavior of their memory while executing and to support various executive functions. The memory management subsystem has the following requirements: A number of processes may exist in memory simultaneously, each only allowed access to its own address space Support for the I/O subsystem and process structure. A process's pages need not be totally resident at any one time. Virtual pages of a process are not physically contiguous. Processes executing the same image will share read only code and data. The memory management subsystem imposes requirements due to the nature of page fault handling that page faults cannot occur at interrupt request levels (IRQL) greater than APC_LEVEL.  This allows the pager to acquire and release mutexes in a deadlock free manner. Because page faults can occur at IRQLs 0 or APC_LEVEL, and routines executing at IRQL 0 can be interrupted by APCs at IRQL APC_LEVEL, all memory management function which acquire mutexes operate at IRQL APC_LEVEL. 2. Address Space Layout The Intel 860 supports a 4-gigabyte virtual address space.  The virtual address space is divided into 3 parts. User Space - Consists of 3 gigabytes which is unique for each address space.  The page ownership for this region is user mode. Hyper Space - Consists of 12 megabytes with a page ownership of kernel mode and unique for each address space.  Page table pages, working set lists, PTEs reserved for temporary mappings, and other address space unique structures reside in this region. System Space - Consists of almost 1 gigabyte which is shared among all address spaces and has a page ownership of kernel mode. The page ownership (user mode or kernel mode) is used for access checks for operations on virtual addresses.      Layout of Virtual Address Space:    +------------------------+ 00000000      |                        |    |                        |    |  User Space            |    |                        |    |                        |     +------------------------+ C0000000    |  Hyper Space           |    +------------------------+ C0C00000    |                        |    |  System Space          |    |                        |    +------------------------+ FFFFFFFF System space contains a paged and a non-paged area.  The paged area starts at the low addresses and grows upward, while the nonpaged area starts at the high addresses and grows downward. The highest 32k bytes of the address space are reserved for mapping non-paged constructs used by the kernel. The Intel 860 dispatches traps to virtual address FFFFFF00, which is in the last page of the virtual address space.  The page before the trap page is used to map constructs for the kernel to utilize in trap handling.  This page is used for saving and restoring various registers, locating the kernel process object and locating the user's thread control block (TEB).  In addition, the page is double mapped into the user portion of the address space as read-only to allow routines executing in user mode to locate the TEB. The last 64K bytes of user space (BFFF0000 - BFFFFFFF) is set as no access.  This allows argument probing within the executive to be accomplished by comparing the specified address to the highest valid address in user space (BFFEFFFF).  If the address less than the highest valid address, it resides within user space, and the access is allowed (note that the actual page protection may not permit the access).  By setting the last 64K bytes as no access, an argument that straddles the boundary causes an access violation. If access to the user's data is allowed, the routine requesting the access check eventually attempts to read or write the data.  If the page protection prevents the access, an access violation exception is delivered and is handled by the routine attempting the access. Any time data which resides in the user space portion of the address space is being read or written from kernel mode, an exception handler must be present to handle access violations.  This is required because another thread within the process can potentially change the protection or validity of any page within user space after argument validation has occurred. 3. Initial Page Directory at Address Space Creation When an address space is initially created, the user portion of the address space is set to no access.  This is accomplished by zeroing entries 0 through 767 of the new process's PD (page directory). Nonpaged system space is initialized by copying PD entries 992 through 1023 of the current process to the PD of the new process.  This provides an identical view of a 128 megabyte nonpaged system space in every process. Paged system space is created by building a Virtual Address Descriptor which describes the range of paged system space and the section which maps the paged system space.  Initial references to paged system space result in page faults which are then resolved to map the corresponding page within the paged system space. Hyper Space is created by mapping PD entry 768 to the physical page that contains the PD itself, and mapping entry 769 to a private page table page that will contain the page table entries to map the address space control structures.  During the life of the process, this region can grow expand by 4 megabytes due to large working sets. By mapping the PD to itself means that all references through PD entry 768 refer to page table pages. For example, the 32-bit word at address 0xC0000000 is the page table entry (PTE) which describes the page which maps addresses 0 through 4095.  By mapping the page directory onto itself, all processes have their page table pages mapped at the same address, and one process does not have a view of another process's page table pages.  4. Page Frame Database (PFN) The PFN database contains information about each page of physical memory.  The fact that this information must be available while the page is being used prevents this information from being stored in the page itself. Every physical page of memory is in one of 5 states: Active and valid. A valid PTE refers to this page. Transition.  The page is on either the modified list or the standby list. The page contents are still valid, but the page is not currently in any process's working set.   A non-valid, transition PTE refers to this physical page. Free. The page is on the free list and may be used immediately. Zeroed.  The page is on the zeroed list. It may be used immediately and contains all zeroes. Bad.  The page is on the bad list.  The page has parity or hard ECC errors which prevent it from being used. The PFN database contains information to link all pages except active/valid pages together in lists.  This allows pages to be easily manipulated to satisfy page faults. The PFN database consists an array of records indexed by the physical page number, and has the following structure:   +-----------------------------------+   | Forward link,  Event Address or   |   |     Working Set Index Hint        |   +-----------------------------------+   | Virtual Address of (Proto) PTE    |   +-----------------------------------+   | Backward link  or  Share Count    |   +-----------------------------------+   | Reference Count | # valid PTEs    |   +-----------------------------------+   | Original PTE contents             |   +-----------------------------------+   | PFN of PTE      | flags           |   +-----------------------------------+ When the page is on one of the lists (free, standby, modified, zeroed, or bad), the Forward and Backward link fields link the elements of the list together. Note that when a page is on one of the lists, the ShareCount must be zero and therefore can be overlayed with the backward link, but the ReferenceCount may not be zero as there could be I/O in progress for this page. This is true when the page is being written to backing storage. When a page is active/valid or transition the original contents of the PTE (which could be a prototype PTE, see section 7 for information about prototype PTEs) are stored in the PFN element.  This allows the PTE to be restored when the physical page is no longer resident. In addition to the contents of the PTE, the virtual address of the PTE and the physical page number of the page which contains the PTE are stored in the PFN element.  These fields provide the virtual and the physical address of the PTE which maps the page. When a page is active/valid, the ShareCount field represents the number of PTEs which refer to this page.  As long as the ShareCount is greater than zero, the page is not eligible for removal from memory. The ReferenceCount field represents the number of reasons the page must be kept in memory.  The ReferenceCount field is incremented when a page initially becomes valid (ShareCount becomes non-zero) and when the page is locked in memory for I/O.  The ReferenceCount is decremented when the ShareCount becomes zero and when pages are unlocked from memory.  When the ReferenceCount becomes zero, the page is placed on the free, standby or modified list depending on the contents of various flags. The working set index hint field is only valid when the ShareCount is non-zero.  This field indicates the index into the working set where the virtual address that maps this physical page resides.  If the page is a private page, then the working set index field always contains the proper value as the page is only mapped at a single virtual address.  In the case of a shared page, this hint value is only correct for the first process which made the page valid.  The process which sets the hint field is guaranteed that the hint field refers to the proper index and does not need to add the Working Set List Entry referenced by the hint index into the working set tree.  This reduces the size of the working set tree allowing faster searches for particular entries. The following information is contained in the flags field: Modified state - Indicates if the page was modified requiring its contents to be saved if it is removed from memory. Prototype PTE - Indicates the PTE referenced by the PFN element is a prototype PTE. In-page read in progress - Indicates that an in-page operation is in progress for the page.  In this case the event address is stored in the field used for the forward link. Parity error - Indicates the physical page contains parity or ECC errors. In-page error - Indicates an I/O error occurred during the in-page operation on this page. The number of valid PTEs field contains the count of PTEs within this physical page which are either valid or in transition.  If this field is not zero, the page cannot be removed from memory. 5. Paged and Nonpaged Dynamic Memory At system initialization the memory management subsystem creates two dynamic memory regions for use by the executive for storage allocation and deallocation.  These storage pools are located in the system part of the address space and are mapped at the same virtual address in every process.  The nonpaged pool consists of a range of virtual addresses which are guaranteed to be resident in physical memory at all times and thus can be accessed from any address space without page faults.  This is mapped through a single set of page table pages which are shared by each process. The paged pool consists of a range of virtual addresses which may be paged in and out of a process's working set.  Each process has a unique copy of page table pages which refer to the paged portion of system space.  This means that there is no guarantee that an address within the paged portion of the system will not cause a page fault at any time.  For this reason data structures which are operated at IRQL levels greater than APC_LEVEL must be allocated from nonpaged pool.   6. Page Fault Handling A page fault occurs when the valid (present) bit in a PTE is zero indicating the desired page is not resident in memory.  When a page fault occurs, the memory management system examines various structures to determine if the fault is a page fault or an access violation. Upon entry, the page fault handler locates the PTE which describes the page.  Note, that the page table page containing the PTE could be non-resident, or could not exist.  If it does not exist, the PTE which describes the page is treated as if it were zero. Note, that before the page is made valid, access checks are performed to ensure the requestor has access to the page. Once the PTE is found, it can be in one of six states: Active and valid - Another thread already faulted the page into memory. Transition - The desired page is in memory on either the standby or modified list. Demand Zero - The desired page should be satisfied with a page of zeroes. Page File Format - The desired page resides within a paging file and should be in-paged. Prototype PTE Format - The desired page is potentially shared and this PTE refers to the Prototype PTE for the shared page. Unknown - The PTE is zero.  This means the virtual address descriptors should be examined to determine if this virtual address has been allocated. The following figures describe the contents of a PTE for the first 5 cases.  The below abbreviations are used;  Hardware usage (defined by Intel 860 reference manual): vld - valid bit (present bit) wrt - write bit own - owner (user) wt - write through cache bit cd - cache disable bit acc - accessed bit dty - dirty bit rsv - reserved, must be zero when vld is one gp - guard page prot. code - protection code value protection no-access read-only execute-read execute-only read-write execute-read-write read-writecopy execute-read-writecopy 8+(0-7)   no-cache + protection (0-7) 16+(0-15)  guard page + protection (0-15) Software usage (defined by Windows NT memory management): trn - if set page is in transition state (pro must be zero) cow - if set page should be copied on write operation pro - if set in a PTE, then the PTE refers to a prototype PTE.  If set in a prototype PTE, then the prototype PTE is in mapped format. 6.1 Valid PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t| |c|r|r|d|a|c|w|o|w|v|   | Page Frame Number             |r| |o|s|s|t|c|d|t|w|r|l|   |                               |n| |w|v|v|y|c| | |n|t|d|   |                                0 0   0 0             1|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 6.2 Transition PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect |c|w|o|w|v|   | Page Frame Number             |r|r|  code   |d|t|w|r|l|   |                               |n|o|         | | |n|t|d|   |                                1 0                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 6.3 Demand Zero PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect | page  |v|   | Page File Offset (all zeroes) |r|r|  code   | file  |l|   |                               |n|o|         | number|d|   |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0 0 0 0 0 0           0 0 0 0 0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 6.4 PTE Referring to Page in Paging File    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect | page  |v|   | Page File Offset (20 bits)    |r|r|  code   | file  |l|   |                               |n|o|         | number|d|   |                                0 0                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 6.5 PTE Referring to Prototype PTE (protection code in protoPTE)    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                                 |p|r|r| Offset to   |v|   | Offset to Prototype PTE         |r|s|s| Proto PTE   |l|   |            <27:7>               |o|v|v|    <6:0>    |d|   |                                  1 0 0               0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 6.6 PTE Referring to Prototype PTE (protection code here)    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                                 |p| protect |       |v|   | Offset to Prototype PTE         |r|  code   |       |l|   |            <27:7>               |o|         |       |d|   |1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1     1 1 1 1 1 1                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Note that a PTE in the transition state is indicated by the transition bit being set to 1 and the bit normally occupied by the prototype PTE indicator set to 0.  In this case, the state of the prototype PTE indicator is maintained in the page frame database.  7. Prototype PTEs Prototype PTEs have a similar format as normal PTEs, but are a memory management structure and never reside in a page table page.  Prototype PTEs are created as a result of section creation and POSIX fork and provide the mechanism for sharing pages between multiple address spaces. When a view of a section is mapped, the PTEs in the address space refer to the corresponding prototype PTE for the section.  Hence when multiple address spaces map the same view, the same prototype PTEs are referenced allowing sharing of the physical page. When a PTE refers to a prototype PTE, the address of the prototype PTE is calculated by multiplying the offset value by 4 and adding it to the system prototype PTE base address. Note that prototype PTEs are allocated from paged pool. Once the prototype PTE has been located, it can be in one of 5 states: Active and valid - Another thread already faulted the page Transition - The desired page is in memory on one of the memory management lists (standby or modified list) Demand Zero - The desired page should be satisfied with a page of zeroes Page File Format - The desired page resides within a paging file and should be in-paged Mapped File Format - The desired page is in a mapped file and should be in-paged 7.1 Valid Prototype PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p|c|r|r|d|a|c|w|o|w|v|   | Page Frame Number             |r|r|o|s|s|t|c|d|t|w|r|l|   |                               |n|o|w|v|v|y|c| | |n|t|d|   |                                0 0   0 0             1|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 7.2 Transition Prototype PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect |c|w|o|w|v|   | Page Frame Number             |r|r|  code   |d|t|w|r|l|   |                               |n|o|         | | |n|t|d|   |                                1 0                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 7.3 Demand Zero Prototype PTE    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect | page  |v|   | Page File Offset (all zeroes) |r|r|  code   | file  |l|   |                               |n|o|         | number|d|   |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0 0 0 0 0 0           0 0 0 0 0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 7.4 Prototype PTE Referring to Page in Paging File    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                               |t|p| protect | page  |v|   | Page File Offset (20 bits)    |r|r|  code   | file  |l|   |                               |n|o|         | number|d|   |                                0 0                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 7.5 Prototype PTE Referring to Page in Mapped File    3                             1 1 1    1                             2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |                                 |p| protect | Offset|v|   | Offset to SubSection            |r|  code   | Subsct|l|   |            <24:4>               |o|         | <3:0> |d|   |                                  1                   0|   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~~+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  \ This hidden paragraph gives Word a place to break the page, so it doesn't split the next picture. \ 8. Page Protection The Intel i860 supports read only and read/write pages. Pages that are protected as either no-access or as guard pages are managed through software.  This is accomplished by setting the protection mask appropriately and on the access trap, examining the protection mask and returning the appropriate status. 9. Retrieving a Free Page The pager must supply a free page for demand zero faults, copy on write operations, and to satisfy in-page requests.  For the demand zero case and in-paging less than a full page, the pager checks the zeroed page list for a page.  If the zeroed page list is empty, the free list is checked and, if empty, the standby list is checked.  If the standby list is empty, then no free pages are available and the thread enters a wait state for a free page. In the case of copy on write and in-paging a full page, the free list is first checked, then the zeroed list and lastly the standby list. If the page is to be removed from the zeroed or the free lists, the pager removes the page from the head of the list and updates the appropriate list structures.  However, if the page is removed from the standby list, the PTE referenced by the corresponding PFN database element is currently in a transition state and must have its original contents restored.   This is accomplished by using the physical address information located in the PFN database element and mapping the PTE within the current process's hyper space.  The transition PTE is then restored to its original state using the mapped virtual address, and the virtual address is unmapped.  Note, to prevent unnecessary TB and cache flushes, a pool of PTEs for mapping addresses is maintained in hyper space and the unmapping of these virtual addresses is only done when the pool becomes exhausted.  At this time all the reserved mapping PTEs are made invalid and the TB and caches are flushed permitting reuse of the PTEs.  10. In-Paging I/O In-paging I/O occurs when a read operation must be issued to a file (paging or mapped) to complete a page fault operation.  The in-page I/O operation is essentially synchronous. It is not APC interruptible, and the thread waits on an event once the I/O operation is issued. In order to support in-paging, each thread control block contains two events and two I/O status blocks which are used for I/O requests.  There are two events and IOSBs to allow the initial in-page I/O to incur a page fault, which could issue another I/O request.  The second I/O request would use the other event/IOSB pair.  This allows file retrieval pointers and other information to be kept in the pagable portion of the executive.  Note, however, that information relating to a paging file must not be maintained in the pagable portion or the page fault cannot complete. The pager uses a special modifier in the I/O request function to indicate paging I/O.  Upon I/O completion, the IoCompletion mechanism recognizes this as paging I/O, and writes the IOSB and sets the event.  It does not attempt to deliver a kernel mode APC or unlock buffers.  Note that both the event and the IOSB are allocated in nonpaged pool and the event is set to false before the I/O is issued.  Setting the event to false prevents a race condition where another thread issues a wait on the event before the I/O system has cleared the event. When the event is set, the wait is satisfied, allowing the pager to continue in-page processing.  The pager checks the IOSB status, updates the PFN database and other structures, and completes the page fault. While the paging I/O operation is in progress, the faulting thread does not own any mutexes.  This allows other threads within the process to incur and handle page faults and issue virtual memory APIs.  This exposes a number of interesting conditions which must be recognized by the pager when the I/O completes and the mutexes are again acquired.  These conditions are: Another thread could have faulted the same page. The page could have been deleted (and remapped) from the virtual address space. Another process could have faulted the same page. The protection on the page could have changed. The fault could have been for a prototype PTE and the page which maps the prototype PTE could be out of the working set. The pager handles these conditions by saving enough state on the kernel stack before the paging I/O request such that when the request is complete, it can detect these conditions, and, in the pathological cases, just dismiss the page fault without making the page valid.  When the faulting instruction is reissued, the pager will again be invoked, and the proper action taken. 10.1 Collided Page Faults The case when another thread or process faults a page which is currently being in-paged is known as a collided page fault.  This case is detected and handled optimally by the pager as it is a common occurrence in multi-threaded systems. When an in-page operation occurs, a physical page is allocated for the I/O request, and the corresponding PTE is placed into the transition state referring to the physical page.  The PFN database element for the physical page contains the original PTE contents, the physical address of the transition PTE, and the virtual address of the event which is used in the I/O request. If another thread or process faults the same page, the collided page fault is detected by the pager noticing that the page is in transition and the read-in-progress flag in the PFN database element is set.  In this case the pager issues a wait operation on the event address specified in the PFN database element. When the I/O operation completes, all threads waiting on the event have their wait satisfied.  The first thread to acquire the PFN database lock, is responsible for performing the in-page completion operations.  This consists of checking the IOSB (which is at a known offset from the event) to ensure the I/O operation completed successfully, clearing the read-in-progress bit in the PFN database, and updating the PTE element. If the IOSB indicates an in-page I/O failure, the PFN database element for the page has the in-page error flag set.  The corresponding PTE element is not updated and an in-page error exception is raised in the faulting thread. When subsequent threads acquire the PFN database lock to complete the collided page fault, the pager recognizes that the initial updating has been performed as the read-in-progress bit is clear, and checks the in-page error flag in the PFN database element to ensure the in-page completed successfully.  If the in-page error flag is set, the PTE is not updated and an in-page error exception is raised in the faulting thread. 11. Sections When a section is created, a section object is created. The section object is allocated from paged pool and contains the following information: Size of the section in bytes. Type of section (page file backed, mapped file, or image file). Pointer to the segment structures that describes the prototype PTE and the control area structures for the section. 11.1 Segments A segment structure is created for every section that is backed by a paging file, and for each section that maps a file that is not already described by a segment.  That means that multiple sections that map the same file all refer to the same segment. A segment structure is allocated from paged pool and contains: Size of the segment in pages and bytes. Type of segment (page file backed, mapped file, or image file) Pointer to control area for the segment Prototype PTEs which describe the segment 11.2 Segment Control Area The segment control area maintains, in nonpaged pool, the information required to perform I/O to and from mapped files.  The segment control area contains: A pointer to the file descriptor for the associated file Number of valid/transition pages in the section Total number of prototype PTEs in section Pointer to section One or more subsection descriptors 11.3 Subsection Descriptors A subsection contains the necessary information to calculate the prototype PTE to logical sector number (LSN) correspondence.  It contains: A pointer to the segment control area Address of first prototype PTE for this subsection Base LSN for this subsection Number of LSNs in this subsection Pointer to any extended subsections When a prototype PTE refers to a subsection, the logical LSN is calculated by subtracting the address of the prototype PTE from the address of first prototype PTE for this subsection.  This result is doubled and added to the base LSN for this subsection.  This yields the LSN for the I/O. The size of the I/O, which is 8 sectors for a full page, is checked against the number of LSNs within this subsection and if a full 8 sectors are not read, the remainder of the page is filled with zeroes. 12. Extending Sections Sections which map data files may be extended.  This is accomplished by comparing the current section size to the requested extension size.  If the section size is greater than the requested extension size, no extension is done. If the section size is less than the extended size, the segment which corresponds to the mapped file is examined.  If its size is greater than the requested extension, the section is extended by merely adjusting the size value in the section object.  If, however, the segment size is smaller than the requested size, the segment is extended. Segment extension is accomplished by allocating enough prototype PTEs to map the requested extension rounded up to the next 4mb boundary.  This allows multiple small extensions to be made without allocating any additional structures.  Associated with the prototype PTEs is a new subsection which points to the segment's control area and the extended prototype PTEs.  This subsection is added to the singlely linked list of subsections for the segment.  In addition, the segment structures are updated to indicate the large size. Mapping a view to the extended part of the section no different than mapping a view to a non-extended section, however, when a page fault occurs for a page within the extended part of the section, the subsection list is searched until the subsection which contains the page is located.  This is accomplished by calculating the PTE offset from the start of the section and then finding the subsection which contains this offset. 13. Image Activation Image activation is a multi-step process which consists of open the image file for execute access, creating a section for the image, mapping the image into the address space, performing fixup operations on the image, "activating any DLLs", and starting the image at it's main entry point. Image activation has the following goals: All executable images are automatically shared among all users of that image. A minimum number of disk I/Os are issued to load and fixup the image. Image fixup operations occur in user mode in the context executing the image. Code, data, and fixup information from images is brought into the address space via the pager.  No special code exists to read images into memory. 13.1 Activation Process The following steps occur to activate an image: Open the image file. The image file is opened using the NtOpenFile or NTCreateFile service.  The specified desired access is FILE_EXECUTE and the file sharing specifies reading with no writers. Create the section. A section is created using the NtCreateSection service passing in the file handle for the image and an attribute indicating the file should be treated as an image rather than as a data file. Create a new process. A new process is created specifying the section handle of the mapped image file.  When the new process is created, the image file will be mapped in the user part of the address space at its specified base address.  If this image cannot be mapped at the specified base address, the process creation fails. During the process creation phase, the system DLL (UDLL.DLL) is also mapped into the address space of the newly created process. Thread startup. The initial thread in the process is created with a context that will cause it to start at the entry-point specified in the image header.  The routine RtlCreateUserProcess is provided to perform the above steps. The executive starts all user-mode threads with a user-mode APC targeted at LdrInitializeThunk.  This procedure exists in the UDLL.DLL mapped in all address spaces.   The LdrInitializeThunk routine does the following: Determines if this is the initial thread of a "non-forked" process.  If this is the not the case, then return as initialization has already been performed.  Note, in the future, initialization of such things as thread local storage, or other thread specific initialization would be performed at this time. DLL initialization is now performed.  The PEB contains the address of the image header for the initial image.  Using the image header, the image's DLL table is located and for each DLL referenced by the image, the following steps occur: If the DLL is already mapped, it doesn't need to be mapped again, skips steps 2 through 4. Open the file for the DLL image. Create a section for the DLL image. Map the DLL image into the address space.  If the DLL could not be mapped at its base address, fixups are performed on the DLL image. For each entry-point used by the main image, resolve references to the mapped DLL. Examine the newly loaded DLL image for DLL and resolve any external references using these same steps. If the DLL contains an initialization routine, call the specified initialization routine. Repeat until all DLL references are resolved. At this point all static DLL references have been resolved and LdrInitializeThunk returns. The thread context is restored and the APC is dismissed. The thread begins execution at the specified address. 13.2 Create Section Operation For Images Once the image file has been opened, the NtCreateSection service is invoked to create the necessary structures to allow the image to mapped and shared between multiple address spaces. Create section performs the following: Translate the file handle to an object pointer with execute access. Check to see if the section field in the file object is NULL.  If the section field is not NULL, a section object for this file already exists and the section has already been created and may be shared (don't do the rest of these steps). Allocate a page of memory and read in the first 4k bytes of the image header (the image header may be less than 4k bytes and the file may be less than 4k bytes, but this read will produce the correct results). Analyze the image header to ensure that the file is a valid image. Using the information found in the image header, create the prototype PTEs, the subsection descriptors, update the section field in the file object, and create the section object. Return the appropriate status and section handle (if successful) to the caller. 13.3 Map view of section The NtMapViewOfSection maps the specified section into the specified address space and returns the base address of the section.  For images, the image header mapped is at the returned base address.  This allows the image header to be analyzed using offsets from the base address.  An attempt is made to map the image at its specified base address thereby eliminating the need for internal fixups on the image. From the image header information for DLLs, fixups, entry point, debugger, etc. may be obtained. 13.4 Image Fixup The image file contains the necessary fixup information to resolve internal image addresses if the image cannot be based at the specified address.  The information is mapped in the TBD section which can be located using the image header. Image fixup is accomplished by mapping the pages to be modified as read/write, and changing the specified addresses by the difference between the desired base address and the actual base address.  Once the fixups have been performed the page protection is changed back to its previous protection. 14. Virtual Address Descriptors Whenever a range of virtual addresses is created (committed or reserved), a virtual address descriptor is built.  A virtual address descriptor contains the following information: Virtual address range for this descriptor Section information, if any Attributes for range including protection and inheritance Link words to form an ordered set of virtual address descriptors As pages within the virtual address descriptor are referenced, page table entries (which are initially zero) are updated to map the appropriate page. 15. POSIX Fork Support POSIX fork requires that a new process (the child) be created with its virtual address mappings and contents identical to the process that initiated the fork (the parent). In order to provide efficient fork operation, pages that are shared between the parent and child are shared copy-on-write. 15.1 Structures to Support Fork There are three structures created during a fork operation: The fork prototype PTEs that describe the unique address space that is shared between the parent and the child.  A fork prototype PTE is a simple structure that contains a prototype PTE and a reference count indicating the number of processes that refer to the prototype PTE.  When the reference count is decremented to zero, any resources (paging file space, physical page) are released. The fork header is a system-wide structure allocated from non-paged pool that contains the size and address of the fork prototype PTEs created during the fork operation. It also contains a reference count indicating the number of processes that refer to at least one of the fork prototype PTEs. When the reference count becomes zero, all the fork prototype PTEs and the associated fork header are deleted. The fork descriptor is a process structure allocated from non-paged pool that contains a pointer to the fork header, the starting and ending address of the fork prototype PTEs, and  a reference count indicating the number of PTEs that refer to fork prototype PTEs. When the reference count in the fork descriptor becomes zero, the fork descriptor is deleted and the reference count in the fork header is decremented. 15.2 Fork Operation When a fork operation is performed, the following steps occur: A new address space is created containing a page directory page, hyper space structures and the mapping of the non-paged executive. An attach process is issued with the parent process as the target. The parent process's virtual address descriptors (VADs) are examined. If the VAD indicates the range is inherit on fork and the VAD is not a section with the PAG_COPY attribute, do the following: Allocate a new VAD from non-paged pool and initialize it as a copy of the parent's VAD. Examine the page directory entry in the child process for the starting virtual address for the memory described by the VAD. If no PDE is allocated, get a free page of memory, otherwise, use the page which has previously been allocated. Examine the PTEs described by the VAD and for each PTE take the following action: Valid - Examine the PFN element to assess the PTE type. If it is a prototype PTE and it was not created from a previous fork operation, put the prototype PTE address into the PFN element preserving the current protection values. If it is a fork prototype PTE, put the prototype PTE address into the PFN element preserving the current protection values and increment the reference count for that fork prototype PTE. If it is not a prototype PTE, allocate a fork prototype PTE, put the new PTE into prototype PTE format, set the reference count for the fork prototype PTE to 2, and change the PFN element to refer to the "fork prototype PTE." Transition Acquire the PFN lock and check the PTE again. If it is still in transition, this page is private and therefore, must be converted into "fork prototype PTE format".  This is identical to the valid case, except the parent's PTE is changed to refer to the fork prototype PTE which is placed into the transition state. Demand Zero Make the corresponding PTE in the child process demand zero. Page File Format Allocate a fork prototype PTE, set the reference count to 2, move the page file format PTE into the fork prototype PTE and put the address of the fork prototype PTE into the PTE of both the parent and the child. Prototype PTE Format Copy the PTE contents to the child process and check to see if this is fork prototype PTE format, if so increment the reference count for the fork prototype PTE.  If the VAD indicates PAG_COPY, each committed page of the section must be copied into a private page.  This is accomplished by creating a VAD to describe the section as a copy-on-write section. Later, in the context of the child process, all pages in the section are read and written, causing a private copy of the page to be created. Once all the VADs have been processed, detach from the parent process and attach to the child process. In the context of the child process, build the structures to manage the VADs, fork descriptors, and force copy-on-write actions to all pages in any PAG_COPY sections. Note that at no time during the processing of the VADs to build the PTEs in the child process was a PTE created in either the valid or transition state. By avoiding this condition no updates need occur to the working set child while attached to the parent process. 16. Working Set Management Associated with every process is a working set.  Two parameters control the size of the working set.  The WorkingSetMinimum is the minimum number of pages guaranteed to be resident or made resident when any thread within the process is executing.  The other parameter is the WorkingSetMaximum which is the maximum number of pages which the process is allowed to have resident.  The WorkingSetMaximum can be exceeded if there is a large number of free pages available. Each page fault requires a page to become resident to satisfy the request.  The working set list is used to track the current number of pages a process has resident in memory.  As pages are made valid, the page is added to the working set.  When the working set reaches its limit, for every page added, a page is discarded.  (Note, that due to cache flushes, etc. it may be the case that a set of pages is removed from the working set when a new page is added.  This allows a number of page faults to occur without each one having to invalidate TBs and data caches.)  The discarded page(s) are not removed from memory immediately, but rather, are placed on the modified or standby lists.  By placing pages on the lists, if a fault occurs for the page while it is still on the list, the fault can be satisfied by removing the page from the list and placing it back into the working set. A working set is an array of working set list entries (WSLE), with each WSLE describing one resident page of the address space.  Associated with the working set list are two indexes.  One index is for the start of the dynamic region (all working set list entries before that index are locked in the working set), and the other is the end of the working set list. Replacement is performed by keeping an index into the dynamic portion of the list.  When a page needs to be removed from the working set, the WSLE found by this index becomes the candidate for removal.  If, after closer examination, this WLSE should be removed, then it is removed and the index is incremented.  If it is not a proper candidate for replacement, the index is incremented and the next WSLE becomes the candidate for replacement.  After the last WSLE in the array is examined, the index is changed to reference the first entry in the dynamic portion of the working set. A WSLE which has been selected as a candidate for removal from the working set has the access bit in its corresponding PTE examined.  If the access bit is currently set, it is cleared and the WSLE is not removed.  If the access bit is clear, the WSLE is removed from the working set and placed on the modified list or standby list.  In order to limit the time to find a WSLE to replace, if a certain number, say 16, WSLEs are examined for replacement and a suitable candidate cannot be found, the first WSLE examined is the one removed from the working set and the index is adjusted accordingly. A working set list entry is created for every valid pageable PTE.  The working set list entry is 64 bits in size and consists of:  Virtual Page Number of this element (20 bits) Attributes (locked in working set, valid, etc.) (12 bits) Link words (16 bits each) to link working set entries together into a sorted list by virtual page number.  If both link words are zero, the entry is directly indexed through the PFN working set index hint field and not in the tree. Because the link words are 16 bits, the maximum size of a working set is limited to 65,535 entries.  This means the largest amount of physical memory a process can consume is 512 MB.  This does not limit the virtual size of a process.  In addition, when this limit becomes a factor, the WSLE will be changed to support a larger working set. 17. Physical Page Management The memory management subsystem maintains a working set for each process so that physical memory is shared equitably among all the active processes on the system.  As the demands for physical memory increase, and the free and zeroed list becomes empty, free pages are obtained by the following methods: Removing pages from the standby list Writing pages on the modified list and placing those pages on the standby list Reducing the size of working sets thereby placing pages on the modified and standby list Eliminating processes from memory by reducing the size of their working sets to zero 17.1 Modified Page Writer The modified page writer is a system thread created during system initialization.  The modified page writer is responsible for limiting the size of the modified page list by writing pages to their backing store locations when the list becomes too big. When invoked, the modified page writer attempts to write as many pages as possible to backing store with a single I/O request.  This is accomplished by examining the original PTE field of the PFN database elements for pages on the modified page list to locate pages in contiguous locations in the backing store.  Once a list is created, the pages are removed from the modified list, an I/O request is issued, and, at successful completion of the I/O request, the pages are placed at the tail of the standby list. Pages which are in the process of being written may be faulted back into memory.  This is accomplished by incrementing both the ReferenceCount and ShareCount for the physical page.  When the I/O completes, the modified page writer notices that the ShareCount is no longer zero, and does not place the page on the standby list. 17.2 Balance Set Manager The balance set manager is created during system initialization and is responsible for trimming process working sets when physical memory becomes over-committed. Each process has a minimum working set which is guaranteed to be available when any thread within the process is executing.  When the balance set manager is invoked, it creates free pages by reducing working sets towards their minimum size by starting with those processes which have the lowest page fault rates. If all working sets are reduced to their minimum, and physical memory is still over-committed, the balance set manager removes processes from the system.  This is accomplished by selecting a process to eliminate, and calling the kernel function KeExcludeProcess.  Once the kernel has prevented the process from executing, the balance set manager reduces the process's working set to zero causing pages to be placed on the modified and standby lists. Once a process has been excluded from the balance set, it becomes eligible for inclusion when either ample physical memory exists for its minimum working set, or threads within the process become computable and the priority is such that the threads should be allowed to execute.  In the later case, another process(es) may be removed from the balance set to free ample physical pages. When the system reaches the state that physical memory is so severely over-committed that processes must be removed from the balance set to allow non-resident processes to be included in the balance set, the system performance suffers greatly.  This case should be avoided in all but the most extreme cases, i.e. the amount of physical memory is inadequate for the workload. Once memory again becomes plentiful the pager allows working sets to expand above their minimum.  This is accomplished by satisfying page faults without removing pages from the working set list. 18. I/O Support The memory management subsystem provides services for operating on virtual memory to support I/O operations.  The following operations are available: Probing pages for access Locking pages in memory Unlocking pages from memory Mapping locked pages into the current address space Unmapping locked pages from the current address space Getting the physical address of a locked page Mapping I/O space Unmapping I/O space These operations are available from kernel mode at IRQL 0 or APC_LEVEL. 18.1 Locking Pages in Memory A range of virtual addresses for the current process are checked for proper accessibility and locked in physical memory with the MmProbeAndLockPages function: MmProbeAndLockPages ( IN PMDL MemoryDescriptionList, IN ULONG AccessMode, IN ULONG Operation Parameters: MemoryDescriptionList - A pointer to a memory description list which contains the starting virtual address to lock, the size in bytes of the region to lock, and an array of elements that are to be filled with physical page numbers. AccessMode - Specifies the access mode with which to probe the region (UserMode or KernelMode). Operation - Specifies the type of the I/O operation (IoWriteAccess, IoReadAccess or IoModifyAccess). This function probes the specified range for access and locks the pages in memory by making any nonresident pages resident and incrementing the ReferenceCount in the PFN database for the physical page.  Incrementing the ReferenceCount prevents the physical page from being reused. If any pages are found with improper access protection, or the processes working set is not sufficient to lock the range in memory, an exception is raised and none of the pages are locked in memory. 18.2 Unlocking Pages from Memory Pages which have been locked in memory are unlocked with the MmUnlockPages function: MmUnlockPages ( IN PMDL MemoryDescriptionList Parameters: MemoryDescriptionList - A pointer to an memory definition list containing the information about locked pages.   This function analyzes the MemoryDescriptionList and unlocks any pages which have been locked.  This function is callable within any process's context. 18.3 Mapping Locked Pages into the Current Address Space Once a page has been locked into memory, the MmMapLockedPages function maps the physical pages into the address space of the current process.  This provides a mechanism for system processes to virtually address the physical memory within another process. PVOID MmMapLockedPages ( IN PMDL MemoryDescriptionList IN KPROCESSOR_MODE AccessMode Parameters: MemoryDescriptorList - Supplies a valid Memory Descriptor List which has been updated by MmProbeAndLockPages. AccessMode - Supplies an indicator of where to map the pages; KernelMode indicates that the pages should be mapped in the system part of the address space, UserMode indicates the pages should be mapped in the user part of the address space. Returns the base address where the pages are mapped.  The base address has the same offset as the virtual address in the MDL. This routine will raise an exception if the processor mode is USER_MODE and quota limits or VM limits are exceeded. 18.4 Unmapping Locked Pages from the Current Address Space Pages which have been mapped into the current process's address space are unmapped with the MmUnmapLockedPages function: MmUnmapLockedPages ( IN PVOID BaseAddress, IN PMDL MemoryDescriptionList Parameters: BaseAddress - The base address where the pages are mapped. MemoryDescriptionList - A pointer to an memory definition list containing the information about locked pages. This function unmaps the pages which were previously mapped.  Once the pages have been unmapped, they may be unlocked.   If the MemoryDescriptionList indicates the pages are not locked an exception is raised. 18.5 Mapping I/O Space Physical addresses residing in the processors I/O space can be mapped to virtual addresses within the nonpagable portion of the system with the MmMapIoSpace function: PVOID MmMapIoSpace ( IN PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress, IN ULONG NumberOfBytes Parameters: PhysicalAddress - The physical address within I/O space to map. NumberOfBytes - The number of bytes to map. This function returns the base virtual address where the requested I/O space was mapped. 18.6 Unmapping I/O Space Physical addresses residing in the processors I/O space can be unmapped from virtual addresses in the nonpagable portion of the system with the MmUnmapIoSpace function: MmUnmapIoSpace ( IN PVOID BaseAddress, IN ULONG NumberOfBytes Parameters: BaseAddress - The virtual address within system space to unmap. NumberOfBytes - The number of bytes to unmap. 18.7 Get Physical Address The physical address mapped by a virtual address which has been locked in memory may be obtained with the MmGetPhysicalAddress function: PHYSICAL_ADDRESS MmGetPhysicalAddress ( IN PVOID BaseAddress Parameters: BaseAddress - Specifies the virtual address of which to provide the physical address. This function returns the physical address of the page mapped by the specified virtual address. 19. File System Caching Support A 256MB region of system space is reserved for file system caching support.  This region has the following characteristics: Not accessible from user-mode. Pagable, but has a system-wide working set.  This means that if a page is valid in the "system cache" it is valid in any address space.  Note, however, that the page could be removed from the working set of the system cache at any time unless it has been explicitly "locked" in the system cache. Only views of mapped files may reside in the cache. Addresses within the system cache may not be used as arguments for the BaseAddress within NT memory management services, e.g., NtLockVirtualMemory supplying the base address argument as an address that resides in the cache. The following routines are provided to the file systems and server for interacting with the system cache. 19.1 Mapping a View in the Cache A view to a section can be mapped in the system cache with the MmMapViewInSystemCache function: NTSTATUS MmMapViewInSystemCache ( IN PVOID SectionObject, OUT PVOID *CapturedBase, IN OUT PLARGE_INTEGER SectionOffset, IN OUT PULONG CapturedViewSize, IN OUT ULONG Protect Parameters: SectionObject - An pointer to a section object. CaputuredAddress - A pointer to a variable that will receive the base address of the view.  SectionOffset - Supplies a pointer to the offset from the beginning of the section to the view in bytes. This value is rounded down to the next allocation granularity size boundary.   CapturedViewSize - A pointer to a variable that will receive the actual size in bytes of the view. If the value of this argument is zero, then a view of the section will be mapped starting at the specified section offset and continuing to the end of the section. Otherwise the initial value of this argument specifies the size of the view in bytes and is rounded up to the next host page size boundary. Protect - The protection desired for the region of initially committed pages. 19.2 Unmapping a View from the Cache NTSTATUS  NtUnmapViewInSystemCache ( IN PVOID BaseAddress Parameters: BaseAddress - A virtual address within the view which is to be unmapped. 18.3 Check and Lock Pages A range of valid (or transition if the virtual address resides within the system cache) virtual addresses may be locked in memory with the check and lock pages function. ULONG MmCheckAndLockPages IN PEPROCESS Process, IN PVOID BaseAddress, IN ULONG SizeToLock Parameters: Process - Supplies a pointer to the process in which these pages are mapped. BaseAddress - A virtual address within the system cache to begin locking. SizeToLock - The number of bytes to attempt to lock in the system cache. The returned value is the number of bytes that were actually locked. This routine checks to see if the specified pages are resident and if so increments the reference count for the page.  For addresses within the system cache, the virtual address is guaranteed to be valid until the pages are unlocked (the reference count for the page becomes zero), for pages not residing in the system cache, the physical page is resident, but a page-fault could occur when referencing this address (though no I/O operation will result from this page fault). NOTE, this routine is not to be used for general locking of user addresses - use MmProbeAndLockPages.  Rather, this routine is intended for well file system caches which maps views of files into the address range and guarantees that the mapping will not be modified (deleted or changed) while the pages are mapped. This routine may be called at DPC_LEVEL and below.  If the base address is not within the system cache and the IRQL is at DPC_LEVEL, no pages will be locked and a zero will be returned. 19.3 Unlock Checked Pages A range of addresses locked in memory with the MmCheckAndLockPages function is unlocked with the MmUnlockCheckedPages. MmUnlockCheckedPages IN PEPROCESS Process, IN PVOID BaseAddress, IN ULONG SizeToUnlock Parameters: Process - Supplies a pointer to the process in which these pages are mapped. BaseAddress - A virtual address within the system cache to begin unlocking. SizeToUnlock - The number of bytes to attempt to lock in the system cache, this was the function value returned when the range was locked. If the base address is within the system cache, this routine may be called at DPC_LEVEL or below.  If the base address is not within the system cache, it may be called at APC_LEVEL or below. 19.4 Read Mapped File A range of virtual memory can be made valid with the MmReadMappedFile function: MmReadMappedFile IN PEPROCESS Process, IN PVOID BaseAddress, IN ULONG Size, IN PIOSTATUS_BLOCK IoStatus Parameters: Process - Supplies a pointer to the process in which these pages are mapped. BaseAddress - Supplies the virtual address within the system cache to begin reading. Size - Supplies the number of bytes to read. IoStatus - Supplies the I/O status value from the in-page operation. This function checks the corresponding PTEs and makes the specified range valid with a minimum number of I/O operations.  Any errors which occur during the in-page sequence are returned in the IoStatus argument. 19.5 Purge Section To support file truncation, pages within a section can be cleared with the MmPurgeSection function: BOOLEAN MmPurgeSection ( IN PVOID SectionObject, IN PLARGE_INTEGER Offset Parameters: SectionObject - Supplies a pointer to the section object which to purge. Offset - Supplies the offset into the file where the purge should begin. This function examines the prototype PTEs beginning at the specified offset.  If the PTE is active and valid, a bugcheck code is issued.  If the PTE is transition, the page is put on the free list and the prototype PTE is loaded with the original contents from the PFN database.  19.6 Force Section Closed A section can be disassociated from a file object with the MmForceSectionClosed function: BOOLEAN MmForceSectionClosed IN POBJECT_FILE FileObject Parameters: FileObject - Supplies a pointer to the file object to check for a section and attempt to close and remove the section reference. If the section cannot be closed due to outstanding references or mapped view, the value FALSE is returned and no action is taken.  If the section was successfully closed, the value TRUE is returned.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8University of Virginia Getting started with WRK TitleGetting started with WRK Marty Humphrey Normal.dot Serge Lidin Microsoft Office Wordurn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceType urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceName urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags mswtermsbjbjN Getting Started with the Windows Research Kernel (WRK) Version 1.23   Thursday April 23, 2009 Marty Humphrey, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia Brian Burns, Program Manager, Microsoft Serge Lidin, Software Design Engineer, Microsoft The purpose of this document is to illustrate how to compile, modify, and use the Windows Research Kernel (WRK). The basic idea is that you will edit and recompile the WRK on a Windows computer, and then run it on a virtual machine running Windows Server 2003. The virtual machine will run in the Virtual PC 2007 environment, which in turn runs under the host Windows OS. The host OS may be Windows Server 2003 or later, or Windows XP or later. This document contains the steps you can take to install everything you need to edit, compile, and run the WRK. The final section of this document describes how to modify the WRK source code, recompile your kernel, and confirm that your changes are executed by attaching a kernel debugger to the virtual machine. Throughout this document, there are nine self-study questions.  The intended audience of this document are new users to the WRK with limited knowledge of the Windows operating system. No special knowledge of operating system design and/or implementation is necessary to perform the steps in this document. Editing the WRK can be accomplished by any text editor, and compilation of the WRK utilizes the nmake utility that is installed with the WRK sources.  General Information You will need to work rather extensively with the console (Windows Command Prompt) windows. To start a fresh console window, use selections (Start ( All Programs ( Accessories ( Command Prompt) OR (Start ( Run), then type   and click OK or press Enter. To execute a command in the console window, type this command and press Enter. There are four components you need to have installed on your machine: Windows Debugger, Virtual PC 2007, virtual machine image of Windows Server 2003 SP1 (with virtual hard drive image), and the WRK itself including source code, tools and binaries. Installation of virtual machine with its hard drive image and of WRK boils down to simple copying them to specified directories.  You can install all the components separately from respective entries on the DVD or you can install everything using file WRKCompleteInstall.bat residing in the root of the DVD. Working with WRKCompleteInstall.bat The WRKCompleteInstall.bat takes four parameters specifying destination directories of the components being installed: /i <virtual_machine_directory> /w <WRK_directory> /d <debugger_directory> /v <Virtual_PC_directory> The default destination directories are as follows: C:\WRK-v1.2\ Virtual machine: C:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ Debugger: C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows\ Virtual PC: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual PC\ If you don t mind the components to be installed to their default destinations, invoke WRKCompleteInstall.bat without parameters by opening Windows Explorer (double-click on  Computer  icon on your desktop), selecting the DVD drive, and double-clicking on WRKCompleteInstall.bat entry. Alternatively, you can run WRKCompleteInstall.bat from a console window, with or without parameters:  Open Windows Explorer and find out what is the letter of your DVD drive (let it be, say, F).  Open console window, type F: and press Enter; you have switched to your DVD drive.  Now type WRKCompleteInstall and press Enter to install the components to default destinations  OR specify the destinations, for example: WRKCompleteInstall /i C:\WRK_VM /w C:\WRK /d C:\WinDbg /v C:\VPC If the full name (path) of a destination directory contains space symbol, the whole path should be enclosed in double quotes, for example: /d  C:\Program Files\WinDbg The destination directories should not yet exist on your drive. If the batch file detects that a destination directory already exists, it skips installation of respective component. This is done to enable the batch file to perform partial installations. For example, if you already have Virtual PC 2007 installed on your computer, specify its installation directory in /v parameter, and installation of Virtual PC 2007 will be skipped. Copying WRK Separately To copy the WRK (presuming you have the other three components already installed) to your machine, follow these steps: - open a console window;  - switch to DVD drive; - execute command cd \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK - execute command WRKCopy /w <destination_directory>   (if you run WRKCopy.bat without parameters, WRK will be copied to C:\WRK-v1.2\); ALTERNATIVELY - open Windows Explorer; - create the destination directory on your hard drive; - switch to DVD drive; - navigate to \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK\WRK-v1.2\; - select all files and subdirectories, drag and drop them to the destination directory. Exercise #1: Building the WRK Windows Research Kernel can be built from Visual Studio 2008 environment or from a console window. To build WRK from command line: - open console window; - switch to the directory WRK was copied to (for example, cd \WRK-v1.2); - execute Build <arch> (or Rebuild <arch> or Clean <arch>), see note about <arch> below; - open console window; - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKEnv <arch>, see note about <arch> below; - execute cd base\ntos - execute nmake %wrkarch%=  To build WRK in VS2008 environment: - start VS2008; - open solution <WRK_DIR>\WRK.sln, where <WRK_DIR> is the directory WRK was copied to; - make sure the Configuration is amd64/Win32 or x86/Win32, as is appropriate; - select Build/Build Solution (or Rebuild Solution, or Clean Solution).  NOTE: don t start the build before looking at question #Q-1, below! The built kernel is located in c:\WRK-v1.2\base\ntos\BUILD\EXE as wrkx86.exe .  NOTE ABOUT <arch> Batch files Build.bat, Rebuild.bat, Clean.bat, WRKEnv.bat and WRKDebug.bat take one parameter   target architecture, which is x86 or amd64.  For the first use of either of these batch files, default target architecture is x86.  Once the target architecture was defined (explicitly or by default), it cannot be changed for current console window, and <arch> parameter of the batch files is ignored. The title of the window where the WRK environment has been set to some target architecture changes to  WRK x86 WRK amd64 To work with different target architecture, open another console window. Questions for this exercise: How long did it take to compile your kernel the first time? If you run the same command a second time (step #5, above), how long does it take? (It is sufficient in this case to  eye-ball seconds  resolution is fine). Exercise #2: Running Windows Server 2003 inside Virtual PC 2007 A fully configured Virtual PC 2007 virtual machine has been provided on this DVD for you to run the WRK. If the default installation options were used, it is located in the directory  C:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ Start Virtual PC 2007 (Start ( All Programs ( Microsoft Virtual PC). This will start the  New Virtual Machine Wizard Add an existing virtual machine Browse to c:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ (or whatever directory you chose with WRKCompleteInstall.bat) and choose the file  Win2k3 SP1 WRK.vmc Click Next ( Finish, making sure the  When I click Finish, open Settings  box is checked. The settings windows for  Win2k3 SP1 WRK  should now be open. Please note the following: Undo Disks  is disabled. Any changes you make to the virtual machine will be written to the hard disk. If you want the option of throwing out any changes you make when you turn off the virtual machine, enable this option.  The named pipe \\.\pipe\debug is configured on COM1. This allows WinDbg to connect to the WRK within the Virtual PC 2007 environment. Virtual Machine Additions  are installed, enabling  pointer integration Virtual Machine Additions  allow a tighter connection between the host machine and the Virtual Machine (for example, the performance of the virtual machine will be better, you can resize the Virtual Machine window, and you will be able to drag-and-drop from the physical machine to the virtual machine).  Note: upon rebooting the Virtual Machine, the way to get  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  to the Virtual Machine is via the Virtual Machine Action  menu. Shared Folder  c:\ ( z:\ is enabled. This option maps the c:\ root directory on the host machine to the z:\ drive on the virtual machine for easy file sharing between the systems. Start the  Win2k3 SP1 WRK  virtual machine from within the Virtual PC Console window.  At the boot prompt, select  Windows Server 2003, Standard . This option boots the original Windows Server 2003 SP1 kernel. The other options boot the WRK with and without debugging enabled. Note: To help people keep track of kernel versions being run, the virtual machine desktop wallpaper has been preconfigured to show the kernel build number. The virtual machine has been preconfigured to automatically login to the administrator account without user interaction. If you prefer to use another account or require user login, please use the information provided in SetAutoAdministratorLogon.zip on the virtual machine desktop to modify this behavior. Give your physical machine a name unique to you to prevent any domain naming conflicts. Right click on My Computer ( Properties (Computer Name (Change  You can also add the virtual machine to a domain if you wish. It is preconfigured to be part of the generic workgroup  WORKGROUP Note: Windows update is turned   to prevent SP2 from being installed in the virtual machine. SP2 is not compatible with the WRK at this time and installing SP2 into the virtual machine can only be reversed if the  Undo Disks  setting is enabled. Questions for this exercise: How big is the physical file that contains your virtual disk? (Right click on the .vhd file and get  Properties  not the .vmc file)   Exercise #3: Monitor the invocation of  QuerySystemInformation In this portion of the lab you will modify the WRK kernel to print out some debugging information to keep track of the number of times  QuerySystemInformation  is invoked (sometimes a developer may wish the kernel is  instrumented  this way for performance purposes   for example, if we find that this function is invoked A LOT, then this function is a reasonable candidate for performance optimization, right?) In this first step, we ll confirm that you can attach a debugger to the kernel (we won t actually modify the kernel until the next step). Follow the instructions at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/871171/ to attach the kernel debugger to your Virtual Machine (Note that this works for Virtual PC 2007 as well   follow the instructions for Virtual PC 2004). Here is some additional information: Start your WRK Virtual Machine if it s not already running and at the boot prompt, chose the  Windows Server 2003 SP1, WRK [debugger enabled]  option. Your virtual machine should sit idle while it waits for the Windows Debugger (WinDbg) to connect. Open a console window on the host machine and start the Windows Debugger:  - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKDebug <arch>  (see note about <arch> in Exercise #1); - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKEnv <arch> (see note about <arch> in Exercise #1); - execute WinDbg %windbgargs%  During the booting activity, you should see a few lines of text on your  WinDbg  window (probably beginning with  Connected to Windows Server 2003 3790 x86 compatible target, ptr64 FALSE ). If not, then re-try, making sure that you selected the debugging kernel to be booted.  Note: In order to connect to the kernel from WinDbg, you may have to click Debug ( Break in the WinDbg window. Once this works, go onto the next step without shutting down your Virtual Machine or your windbdg.exe window. You ll know it works if you see this info in the debugging window and you re able to log onto your WRK Virtual Machine. Now we will modify the kernel, install it on the Virtual Machine, boot the modified kernel, and see the output on the debugging window. We ll start by modifying and recompiling our kernel on the physical machine:   Open a text editor of your choice and edit C:/WRK-v1.2/base/ntos/ex/sysinfo.c Get to line 1721 and insert the following line:  static int NumTimesCalled = 0;  Shortly after this (immediately before the line  Status = STATUS_SUCCESS ), add the following line:  DbgPrint(  WRK  %d: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!!\n ,++NumTimesCalled ); Save the file and recompile the kernel as above (Exercise #2)  Drag-and-drop your new kernel onto the Virtual Machine s Administrator My Documents  folder (the new kernel will be on the physical machine in C:\WRK-v1.2\base\ntos\BUILD\EXE, with the name wrkx86.exe). Once you have moved it to the Virtual Machine, copy this file on the Virtual Machine to C:\WINDOWS\system32\ The virtual machine has been preconfigured to boot the WRK and already contains the file wrkx86.exe in C:\WINDOWS\System32. We recommend you back up this file before copying over it with the modified kernel. When this file is copied over, the WRK boot options in the virtual machine will both point to the new kernel. Reboot the Virtual Machine via Start (  Shutdown ( Restart. Select the  Windows Server 2003 SP1, WRK [debugger enabled]  boot option and watch the output on the debugging window.  Note: you ll probably have to select the debugger window, which may be hidden, and select   to the question  Save information for workspace? If everything is working, you should start seeing something like: WRK 82: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! WRK 83: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! WRK 84: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! If you re not seeing this, then go back through the instructions to see if you ve missed something. Note: if your new kernel does not boot, then you can reboot into the  Windows Server 2003, Standard  boot kernel.  Questions for this exercise: How many times is this function invoked up until right before the Windows login banner appears, right after the WRK Virtual Machine has fully booted?  Show a small section of the output of the invocation of your debugging statement. To do this, first select the Debugging window and then hit Alt-PrtSc ( print screen ). This will put a copy of the window into the edit buffer, which you can then get at (say in Microsoft Office) via Edit ( paste. Once you ve completed that, and closed your Virtual Machine and debugging window, how big is the physical file that contains your virtual disk now? Why is this? (I.e., why is it the same, or why has it changed?) s it! You have successfully modified the Windows Research Kernel and observed your change in action. By following this basic procedure, you are now able to explore all kinds of kernel modifications and subsequently test the effect of such changes.  Our general advice: Always keep a   copy of a kernel bootable via C:\boot.ini   this will allow you to easily revert to a known safe state. Have fun!   We recommend you make a backup copy of this file before saving the modified version.  PAGE  gd7.k yqy`R`y xm\m\m\m\m\m\m\m gdKjy gdhpo :pKwR

WRK v1.2

The Windows Research Kernel v1.2 contains the sources for the core of
the Windows (NTOS) kernel and a build environment for a kernel that will run on
    x86     (Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1) and
    amd64   (Windows XP x64 Professional)
A future version may also support booting WRK kernels on Windows XP x86 systems,
but the current kernels will fail to boot due to differences in some shared 
structures.

The NTOS kernel implements the basic OS functions
for processes, threads, virtual memory and cache managers, I/O management,
the registry, executive functions such as the kernel heap and synchronization,
the object manager, the local procedure call mechanism, the security reference
monitor, low-level CPU management (thread scheduling, Asynchronous and Deferred
Procedure calls, interrupt/trap handling, exceptions), etc.

The NT Hardware Abstraction Layer, file systems, network stacks, and device
drivers are implemented separately from NTOS and loaded into kernel mode
as dynamic libraries.  Sources for these dynamic components are not included
in the WRK, but some are available in various development kits published
by Microsoft, such as the Installable File System (IFS) Kit and the
Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK).

WRK v1.2 includes most of the NTOS kernel sources from the latest released
version of Windows, which supports the AMD64 architecture on the Desktop.
The kernel sources excluded from the kit are primarily in the areas of
plug-and-play, power management, the device verifier, kernel debugger
interface, and virtual dos machine.  The primary modifications to WRK
from the released kernel are related to cleanup and removal of server
support, such as code related to the Intel IA64.

***

Organization of the WRK sources

The file License.txt contains the license covering use of the WRK.

The public\ directory contains a number of include files shared among system
components.  base\ntos\ contains the NTOS sources.

The primary NTOS source components included in the WRK are organized as follows:

    cache\  - cache manager
    config\ - registry implementation
    dbgk\   - user-mode debugger support
    ex\     - executive functions (kernel heap, synchronization, time)
    fsrtl\  - file system run-time support
    io\     - I/O manager
    ke\     - scheduler, CPU management, low-level synchronization
    lpc\    - local procedure call implementation
    mm\     - virtual memory manager
    ob\     - kernel object manager
    ps\     - process/thread support
    se\     - security functions
    wmi\    - Windows Management Instrumentation

    inc\    - NTOS-only include files
    rtl\    - kernel run-time support
    init\   - kernel startup

Copying and building the WRK

WRK can be built on Windows Server 2003 or later, or on Windows XP or later.

To copy WRK to your machine: 
- open a console window; 
- switch to DVD;
- switch to \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK\;
- run WRKCopy.bat /w <destination_directory>
  (if you run WRKCopy.bat without parameters, WRK will be copied to C:\WRK-v1.2\);
ALTERNATIVELY
- open Windows Explorer (MyComputer);
- create the destination directory on your hard drive;
- switch to DVD;
- navigate to \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK\WRK-v1.2\;
- select all files and subdirectories, drag and drop them to the destination 
  directory.

To adjust the WRK environment setting batch file:
- open console window;
- switch to the directory WRK was copied to;
- run Notepad WRKEnv.bat;
- make sure the "set path=..." statement contains the directory WinDbg was 
  installed to; (unchanged WRKEnv.bat refers to default directory 
  C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows);
- save the file and exit Notepad. 

To build WRK from command line:
- open console window;
- switch to the directory WRK was copied to;
- run Build <arch> (or Rebuild <arch> or Clean <arch>), see note about <arch> 
  below;
ALTERNATIVELY
- open console window;
- switch to the directory WRK was copied to;
- run WRKEnv <arch>, see note about <arch> below;
- switch to base\ntos;
- run nmake %wrkarch%= 

To build WRK in Visual Studio 2008 environment:
- start VS2008;
- open solution <WRK_DIR>\WRK.sln, where <WRK_DIR> is the directory WRK was 
  copied to;
- make sure the configuration is amd64/Win32 or x86/Win32, as is appropriate;
- select Build/Build Solution (or Rebuild Solution, or Clean Solution). 

To start Windows Debugger from command line:
- open console window;
- switch to the directory WRK was copied to;
- run WRKDebug <arch>, see note about <arch> below;
ALTERNATIVELY
- open console window;
- switch to the directory WRK was copied to;
- run WRKEnv <arch>, see note about <arch> below;
- run WinDbg %windbgargs% 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE ABOUT <ARCH>

Batch files Build.bat, Rebuild.bat, Clean.bat, WRKEnv.bat and WRKDebug.bat 
take one parameter  target architecture, which is x86 or amd64.
 
For the first use of either of these batch files, default target architecture 
is x86.
 
Once the target architecture was defined (explicitly or by default), it 
cannot be changed for current console window, and <arch> parameter of the 
batch files is ignored.

The title of the window where the WRK environment has been set to some target 
architecture changes to WRK x86 or WRK amd64.

To work with different target architecture, open another console window.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8University of Virginia Getting started with WRK TitleGetting started with WRK Marty Humphrey Normal.dot Serge Lidin Microsoft Office Wordurn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceType urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceName urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags mswtermsbjbjN Getting Started with the Windows Research Kernel (WRK) Version 1.23   Thursday April 23, 2009 Marty Humphrey, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia Brian Burns, Program Manager, Microsoft Serge Lidin, Software Design Engineer, Microsoft The purpose of this document is to illustrate how to compile, modify, and use the Windows Research Kernel (WRK). The basic idea is that you will edit and recompile the WRK on a Windows computer, and then run it on a virtual machine running Windows Server 2003. The virtual machine will run in the Virtual PC 2007 environment, which in turn runs under the host Windows OS. The host OS may be Windows Server 2003 or later, or Windows XP or later. This document contains the steps you can take to install everything you need to edit, compile, and run the WRK. The final section of this document describes how to modify the WRK source code, recompile your kernel, and confirm that your changes are executed by attaching a kernel debugger to the virtual machine. Throughout this document, there are nine self-study questions.  The intended audience of this document are new users to the WRK with limited knowledge of the Windows operating system. No special knowledge of operating system design and/or implementation is necessary to perform the steps in this document. Editing the WRK can be accomplished by any text editor, and compilation of the WRK utilizes the nmake utility that is installed with the WRK sources.  General Information You will need to work rather extensively with the console (Windows Command Prompt) windows. To start a fresh console window, use selections (Start ( All Programs ( Accessories ( Command Prompt) OR (Start ( Run), then type   and click OK or press Enter. To execute a command in the console window, type this command and press Enter. There are four components you need to have installed on your machine: Windows Debugger, Virtual PC 2007, virtual machine image of Windows Server 2003 SP1 (with virtual hard drive image), and the WRK itself including source code, tools and binaries. Installation of virtual machine with its hard drive image and of WRK boils down to simple copying them to specified directories.  You can install all the components separately from respective entries on the DVD or you can install everything using file WRKCompleteInstall.bat residing in the root of the DVD. Working with WRKCompleteInstall.bat The WRKCompleteInstall.bat takes four parameters specifying destination directories of the components being installed: /i <virtual_machine_directory> /w <WRK_directory> /d <debugger_directory> /v <Virtual_PC_directory> The default destination directories are as follows: C:\WRK-v1.2\ Virtual machine: C:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ Debugger: C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows\ Virtual PC: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual PC\ If you don t mind the components to be installed to their default destinations, invoke WRKCompleteInstall.bat without parameters by opening Windows Explorer (double-click on  Computer  icon on your desktop), selecting the DVD drive, and double-clicking on WRKCompleteInstall.bat entry. Alternatively, you can run WRKCompleteInstall.bat from a console window, with or without parameters:  Open Windows Explorer and find out what is the letter of your DVD drive (let it be, say, F).  Open console window, type F: and press Enter; you have switched to your DVD drive.  Now type WRKCompleteInstall and press Enter to install the components to default destinations  OR specify the destinations, for example: WRKCompleteInstall /i C:\WRK_VM /w C:\WRK /d C:\WinDbg /v C:\VPC If the full name (path) of a destination directory contains space symbol, the whole path should be enclosed in double quotes, for example: /d  C:\Program Files\WinDbg The destination directories should not yet exist on your drive. If the batch file detects that a destination directory already exists, it skips installation of respective component. This is done to enable the batch file to perform partial installations. For example, if you already have Virtual PC 2007 installed on your computer, specify its installation directory in /v parameter, and installation of Virtual PC 2007 will be skipped. Copying WRK Separately To copy the WRK (presuming you have the other three components already installed) to your machine, follow these steps: - open a console window;  - switch to DVD drive; - execute command cd \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK - execute command WRKCopy /w <destination_directory>   (if you run WRKCopy.bat without parameters, WRK will be copied to C:\WRK-v1.2\); ALTERNATIVELY - open Windows Explorer; - create the destination directory on your hard drive; - switch to DVD drive; - navigate to \Resources\Windows_Research_Kernel\Get_WRK\WRK-v1.2\; - select all files and subdirectories, drag and drop them to the destination directory. Exercise #1: Building the WRK Windows Research Kernel can be built from Visual Studio 2008 environment or from a console window. To build WRK from command line: - open console window; - switch to the directory WRK was copied to (for example, cd \WRK-v1.2); - execute Build <arch> (or Rebuild <arch> or Clean <arch>), see note about <arch> below; - open console window; - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKEnv <arch>, see note about <arch> below; - execute cd base\ntos - execute nmake %wrkarch%=  To build WRK in VS2008 environment: - start VS2008; - open solution <WRK_DIR>\WRK.sln, where <WRK_DIR> is the directory WRK was copied to; - make sure the Configuration is amd64/Win32 or x86/Win32, as is appropriate; - select Build/Build Solution (or Rebuild Solution, or Clean Solution).  NOTE: don t start the build before looking at question #Q-1, below! The built kernel is located in c:\WRK-v1.2\base\ntos\BUILD\EXE as wrkx86.exe .  NOTE ABOUT <arch> Batch files Build.bat, Rebuild.bat, Clean.bat, WRKEnv.bat and WRKDebug.bat take one parameter   target architecture, which is x86 or amd64.  For the first use of either of these batch files, default target architecture is x86.  Once the target architecture was defined (explicitly or by default), it cannot be changed for current console window, and <arch> parameter of the batch files is ignored. The title of the window where the WRK environment has been set to some target architecture changes to  WRK x86 WRK amd64 To work with different target architecture, open another console window. Questions for this exercise: How long did it take to compile your kernel the first time? If you run the same command a second time (step #5, above), how long does it take? (It is sufficient in this case to  eye-ball seconds  resolution is fine). Exercise #2: Running Windows Server 2003 inside Virtual PC 2007 A fully configured Virtual PC 2007 virtual machine has been provided on this DVD for you to run the WRK. If the default installation options were used, it is located in the directory  C:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ Start Virtual PC 2007 (Start ( All Programs ( Microsoft Virtual PC). This will start the  New Virtual Machine Wizard Add an existing virtual machine Browse to c:\WRK-v1.2\Win2k3SP1 Image\ (or whatever directory you chose with WRKCompleteInstall.bat) and choose the file  Win2k3 SP1 WRK.vmc Click Next ( Finish, making sure the  When I click Finish, open Settings  box is checked. The settings windows for  Win2k3 SP1 WRK  should now be open. Please note the following: Undo Disks  is disabled. Any changes you make to the virtual machine will be written to the hard disk. If you want the option of throwing out any changes you make when you turn off the virtual machine, enable this option.  The named pipe \\.\pipe\debug is configured on COM1. This allows WinDbg to connect to the WRK within the Virtual PC 2007 environment. Virtual Machine Additions  are installed, enabling  pointer integration Virtual Machine Additions  allow a tighter connection between the host machine and the Virtual Machine (for example, the performance of the virtual machine will be better, you can resize the Virtual Machine window, and you will be able to drag-and-drop from the physical machine to the virtual machine).  Note: upon rebooting the Virtual Machine, the way to get  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  to the Virtual Machine is via the Virtual Machine Action  menu. Shared Folder  c:\ ( z:\ is enabled. This option maps the c:\ root directory on the host machine to the z:\ drive on the virtual machine for easy file sharing between the systems. Start the  Win2k3 SP1 WRK  virtual machine from within the Virtual PC Console window.  At the boot prompt, select  Windows Server 2003, Standard . This option boots the original Windows Server 2003 SP1 kernel. The other options boot the WRK with and without debugging enabled. Note: To help people keep track of kernel versions being run, the virtual machine desktop wallpaper has been preconfigured to show the kernel build number. The virtual machine has been preconfigured to automatically login to the administrator account without user interaction. If you prefer to use another account or require user login, please use the information provided in SetAutoAdministratorLogon.zip on the virtual machine desktop to modify this behavior. Give your physical machine a name unique to you to prevent any domain naming conflicts. Right click on My Computer ( Properties (Computer Name (Change  You can also add the virtual machine to a domain if you wish. It is preconfigured to be part of the generic workgroup  WORKGROUP Note: Windows update is turned   to prevent SP2 from being installed in the virtual machine. SP2 is not compatible with the WRK at this time and installing SP2 into the virtual machine can only be reversed if the  Undo Disks  setting is enabled. Questions for this exercise: How big is the physical file that contains your virtual disk? (Right click on the .vhd file and get  Properties  not the .vmc file)   Exercise #3: Monitor the invocation of  QuerySystemInformation In this portion of the lab you will modify the WRK kernel to print out some debugging information to keep track of the number of times  QuerySystemInformation  is invoked (sometimes a developer may wish the kernel is  instrumented  this way for performance purposes   for example, if we find that this function is invoked A LOT, then this function is a reasonable candidate for performance optimization, right?) In this first step, we ll confirm that you can attach a debugger to the kernel (we won t actually modify the kernel until the next step). Follow the instructions at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/871171/ to attach the kernel debugger to your Virtual Machine (Note that this works for Virtual PC 2007 as well   follow the instructions for Virtual PC 2004). Here is some additional information: Start your WRK Virtual Machine if it s not already running and at the boot prompt, chose the  Windows Server 2003 SP1, WRK [debugger enabled]  option. Your virtual machine should sit idle while it waits for the Windows Debugger (WinDbg) to connect. Open a console window on the host machine and start the Windows Debugger:  - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKDebug <arch>  (see note about <arch> in Exercise #1); - switch to the directory WRK was copied to; - execute WRKEnv <arch> (see note about <arch> in Exercise #1); - execute WinDbg %windbgargs%  During the booting activity, you should see a few lines of text on your  WinDbg  window (probably beginning with  Connected to Windows Server 2003 3790 x86 compatible target, ptr64 FALSE ). If not, then re-try, making sure that you selected the debugging kernel to be booted.  Note: In order to connect to the kernel from WinDbg, you may have to click Debug ( Break in the WinDbg window. Once this works, go onto the next step without shutting down your Virtual Machine or your windbdg.exe window. You ll know it works if you see this info in the debugging window and you re able to log onto your WRK Virtual Machine. Now we will modify the kernel, install it on the Virtual Machine, boot the modified kernel, and see the output on the debugging window. We ll start by modifying and recompiling our kernel on the physical machine:   Open a text editor of your choice and edit C:/WRK-v1.2/base/ntos/ex/sysinfo.c Get to line 1721 and insert the following line:  static int NumTimesCalled = 0;  Shortly after this (immediately before the line  Status = STATUS_SUCCESS ), add the following line:  DbgPrint(  WRK  %d: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!!\n ,++NumTimesCalled ); Save the file and recompile the kernel as above (Exercise #2)  Drag-and-drop your new kernel onto the Virtual Machine s Administrator My Documents  folder (the new kernel will be on the physical machine in C:\WRK-v1.2\base\ntos\BUILD\EXE, with the name wrkx86.exe). Once you have moved it to the Virtual Machine, copy this file on the Virtual Machine to C:\WINDOWS\system32\ The virtual machine has been preconfigured to boot the WRK and already contains the file wrkx86.exe in C:\WINDOWS\System32. We recommend you back up this file before copying over it with the modified kernel. When this file is copied over, the WRK boot options in the virtual machine will both point to the new kernel. Reboot the Virtual Machine via Start (  Shutdown ( Restart. Select the  Windows Server 2003 SP1, WRK [debugger enabled]  boot option and watch the output on the debugging window.  Note: you ll probably have to select the debugger window, which may be hidden, and select   to the question  Save information for workspace? If everything is working, you should start seeing something like: WRK 82: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! WRK 83: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! WRK 84: Entering NTQuerySystemInformation!!! If you re not seeing this, then go back through the instructions to see if you ve missed something. Note: if your new kernel does not boot, then you can reboot into the  Windows Server 2003, Standard  boot kernel.  Questions for this exercise: How many times is this function invoked up until right before the Windows login banner appears, right after the WRK Virtual Machine has fully booted?  Show a small section of the output of the invocation of your debugging statement. To do this, first select the Debugging window and then hit Alt-PrtSc ( print screen ). This will put a copy of the window into the edit buffer, which you can then get at (say in Microsoft Office) via Edit ( paste. Once you ve completed that, and closed your Virtual Machine and debugging window, how big is the physical file that contains your virtual disk now? Why is this? (I.e., why is it the same, or why has it changed?) s it! You have successfully modified the Windows Research Kernel and observed your change in action. By following this basic procedure, you are now able to explore all kinds of kernel modifications and subsequently test the effect of such changes.  Our general advice: Always keep a   copy of a kernel bootable via C:\boot.ini   this will allow you to easily revert to a known safe state. Have fun!   We recommend you make a backup copy of this file before saving the modified version.  PAGE  gd7.k yqy`R`y xm\m\m\m\m\m\m\m gdKjy gdhpo :pKwR

BugChecks and what to do about them:

Bugchecks with no descriptions are either checked builds
only or very rare.  If you get one of these and a kernel
debugger is available do the following
    kb
    !process 0 7
    !vm
    !errlog

Note:
Please use following format for modifications in this file, it helps
the debugger to extract the description text from this file:

APC_INDEX_MISMATCH               (0x1)
This is a kernel internal error which can occur only on a checked build.
The most common reason to see such a bugcheck would occur when a
filesystem had a mismatched number of KeEnterCriticalRegion calls compared
to KeLeaveCriticalRegion calls.  This check is made on exit from a system
call.
PARAMETERS
    1 - address of system function (system call)
    2 - Thread->ApcStateIndex << 8 | Previous ApcStateIndex
    3 - Thread->KernelApcDicable
    4 - Previous KernelApcDisable

        4 - address which referenced memory

DESCRIPTION
An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.  This is usually
caused by drivers using improper addresses.

If a kernel debugger is available get the stack backtrace.

BAD_POOL_HEADER                  (0x19)

The pool is already corrupt at the time of the current request.
This may or may not be due to the caller.
The internal pool links must be walked to figure out a possible cause of
the problem, and then special pool applied to the suspect tags or the driver
verifier to a suspect driver.
PARAMETERS

    VALUES:
    3 : the pool freelist is corrupt.
       Parameter 2 - the pool entry being checked.
       Parameter 3 - the read back flink freelist value (should be the same as 2).
       Parameter 4 - the read back blink freelist value (should be the same as 2).

    5 : the adjacent pool block headers are corrupt.
       Parameter 2 - One entry whose headers are not consistent.
       Parameter 3 - (reserved)
       Parameter 4 - Another entry whose headers are not consistent.

    END_VALUES

MEMORY_MANAGEMENT                (0x1A)

PARAMETERS
    1 - The subtype of the bugcheck:
        VALUES:
            0x1 : The fork clone block reference count is corrupt.  Only occurs
                  on checked builds.
          0x777 : The caller is unlocking a system cache address that is not
                  currently locked.  (This address was either never mapped or
                  is being unlocked twice.)
          0x778 : The system is using the very last system cache view address,
                  instead of preserving it.
      0x780-781 : The PTEs mapping the argument system cache view have been
                  corrupted.
         0x1000 : A caller of MmGetSystemAddressForMdl* tried to map a fully-
                  cached physical page as non-cached.  This action would cause
                  a conflicting hardware translation buffer entry, and so it
                  was refused by the operating system.  Since the caller
                  specified "bugcheck on failure" in the requesting MDL, the
                  system had no choice but to bugcheck in this instance.
         0x1010 : The caller is unlocking a pageable section that is not
                  currently locked.  (This section was either never locked or
                  is being unlocked twice.)
         0x1234 : The caller is trying lock a nonexistent pageable section.
         0x1235 : The caller is trying to protect an MDL with an invalid
                  mapping.
         0x3451 : The PTEs of an outswapped kernel thread stack are corrupt.
    0x8888-8889 : Internal memory management structures are corrupt.
        0x41283 : The working set index encoded in the PTE is corrupt.
        0x41284 : A PTE or the working set list is corrupt.
        0x41286 : The caller is trying to free an invalid pool address.
        0x41785 : The working set list is corrupt.
        0x61940 : A PDE has been unexpectedly invalidated.
          Other : An unknown memory management error occurred.

PARAMETERS
    1 - The exception code that was not handled
        VALUES
        0x80000002: (STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT) An unaligned data reference was encountered.
                    The trap frame will supply additional information.
        0x80000003: This means a hard coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
                    /NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
                    hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
                    If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
                    system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
                    happening.
        END_VALUES
    2 - The address that the exception occurred at
    3 - Parameter 0 of the exception
    4 - Parameter 1 of the exception

DESCRIPTION
This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.

SHARED_RESOURCE_CONV_ERROR       (0x1F)

KERNEL_APC_PENDING_DURING_EXIT   (0x20)
PARAMETERS
    1 - The address of the APC found pending during exit.
    2 - The thread's APC disable count
    3 - The current IRQL

DESCRIPTION
The key data item is the thread's APC disable count.
If this is non-zero, then this is the source of the problem.

The APC disable count is decremented each time a driver calls
KeEnterCriticalRegion, KeInitializeMutex, or FsRtlEnterFileSystem.  The APC
disable count is incremented each time a driver calls KeLeaveCriticalRegion,
KeReleaseMutex, or FsRtlExitFileSystem.  Since these calls should always be in
pairs, this value should be zero when a thread exits.  A negative value
indicates that a driver has disabled APC calls without re-enabling them.  A
positive value indicates that the reverse is true.

If you ever see this error, be very suspicious of all drivers installed on the
machine -- especially unusual or non-standard drivers.  Third party file
system redirectors are especially suspicious since they do not generally
receive the heavy duty testing that NTFS, FAT, RDR, etc receive.

This current IRQL should also be 0.  If it is not, that a driver's
cancelation routine can cause this bugcheck by returning at an elevated
IRQL.  Always attempt to note what you were doing/closing at the
time of the crash, and note all of the installed drivers at the time of
the crash.  This symptom is usually a severe bug in a third party
driver.

FILE_SYSTEM                      (0x22)

FAT_FILE_SYSTEM                  (0x23)

    If you see FatExceptionFilter on the stack then the 2nd and 3rd
    parameters are the exception record and context record. Do a .cxr
    on the 3rd parameter and then kb to obtain a more informative stack
    trace.

NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x24)

    If you see NtfsExceptionFilter on the stack then the 2nd and 3rd
    parameters are the exception record and context record. Do a .cxr
    on the 3rd parameter and then kb to obtain a more informative stack
    trace.

NPFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x25)

CDFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x26)

    If you see CdExceptionFilter on the stack then the 2nd and 3rd
    parameters are the exception record and context record. Do a .cxr
    on the 3rd parameter and then kb to obtain a more informative stack
    trace.

RDR_FILE_SYSTEM                  (0x27)
    If you see RxExceptionFilter on the stack then the 2nd and 3rd parameters are the
    exception record and context record. Do a .cxr on the 3rd parameter and then kb to
    obtain a more informative stack trace.

    The high 16 bits of the first parameter is the RDBSS bugcheck code, which is defined
    as follows:
     RDBSS_BUG_CHECK_CACHESUP  = 0xca550000,
     RDBSS_BUG_CHECK_CLEANUP   = 0xc1ee0000,
     RDBSS_BUG_CHECK_CLOSE     = 0xc10e0000,
     RDBSS_BUG_CHECK_NTEXCEPT  = 0xbaad0000,


CORRUPT_ACCESS_TOKEN             (0x28)

SECURITY_SYSTEM                  (0x29)

INCONSISTENT_IRP                 (0x2A)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Address of the IRP that was found to be inconsistent

DESCRIPTION
An IRP was encountered that was in an inconsistent state; i.e., some field
or fields of the IRP were inconsistent w/the remaining state of the IRP.
An example would be an IRP that was being completed, but was still marked
as being queued to a driver's device queue.  This bugcheck code is not
currently being used in the system, but exists for debugging purposes.


PANIC_STACK_SWITCH               (0x2B)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Trap Frame
DESCRIPTION
This error indicates that the kernel mode stack was overrun. This normally
occurs when a kernel-mode driver uses too much stack space.  It can also
occur when serious data corruption occurs in the kernel.


PORT_DRIVER_INTERNAL             (0x2C)


SCSI_DISK_DRIVER_INTERNAL        (0x2D)


DATA_BUS_ERROR                   (0x2E)
This bugcheck is normally caused by a parity error in the system memory.
PARAMETERS
        1 - Virtual address that caused the fault
        2 - Physical address that caused the fault.
        3 - Processor status register (PSR)
        4 - Faulting instruction register (FIR)
DESCRIPTION
This error can also be caused by a driver accessing a bad virtual
address whose backing physical address does not exist.


INSTRUCTION_BUS_ERROR            (0x2F)


SET_OF_INVALID_CONTEXT           (0x30)

Attempt to set the stack pointer in the trap frame to a lower value than
the current stack pointer value.   This would cause the kernel run with a
stack pointer pointing to stack which is no longer valid.
PARAMETERS
    1 - New stack pointer
    2 - Old stack pointer
    3 - TrapFrame address
    4 - 0

PHASE0_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x31)

    System init failed early on.  A debugger is required to analyze this.

PHASE1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x32)
PARAMETERS
    1 - NT status code that describes why the system initialization failed.
    2 - (reserved)

UNEXPECTED_INITIALIZATION_CALL   (0x33)

CACHE_MANAGER                    (0x34)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM (0x23)

NO_MORE_IRP_STACK_LOCATIONS      (0x35)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Address of the IRP

DESCRIPTION
A higher level driver has attempted to call a lower level driver through
the IoCallDriver() interface, but there are no more stack locations in the
packet, hence, the lower level driver would not be able to access its
parameters, as there are no parameters for it.  This is a disasterous
situation, since the higher level driver "thinks" it has filled in the
parameters for the lower level driver (something it MUST do before it calls
it), but since there is no stack location for the latter driver, the former
has written off of the end of the packet.  This means that some other memory
has probably been trashed at this point.

DEVICE_REFERENCE_COUNT_NOT_ZERO  (0x36)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Address of the device object

DESCRIPTION
A device driver has attempted to delete one of its device objects from the
system but the reference count for that object was non-zero, meaning that
there are still outstanding references to the device.  (The reference count
indicates the number of reasons why this device object cannot be deleted.)
This is a bug in the calling device driver.

FLOPPY_INTERNAL_ERROR            (0x37)

SERIAL_DRIVER_INTERNAL           (0x38)

SYSTEM_EXIT_OWNED_MUTEX          (0x39)

SYSTEM_UNWIND_PREVIOUS_USER      (0x3A)

SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION         (0x3B)
An exception happened while executing a system service routine.

PARAMETERS
        1- Exception code that caused the bugcheck
        2- Address of the exception record for the exception that caused the bugcheck
        3- Address of the context record for the exception that caused the bugcheck
        4- zero.

INTERRUPT_UNWIND_ATTEMPTED       (0x3C)

INTERRUPT_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED  (0x3D)

MULTIPROCESSOR_CONFIGURATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (0x3E)
The system has multiple processors, but they are asymmetric in relation
to one another.  In order to be symmetric all processors must be of
the same type and level.  For example, trying to mix a Pentium level
processor with an 80486 would cause this bugcheck.


NO_MORE_SYSTEM_PTES              (0x3F)
PARAMETERS
        1 - PTE Type (0 - system expansion, 1 nonpaged pool expansion)
        2 - Requested size
        3 - Total free system PTEs
        4 - Total system PTEs

DESCRIPTION
No System PTEs left.  Usually caused by a driver not cleaning up
properly.  If kernel debugger available get stack trace and
"!sysptes 3".

Set HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\TrackPtes
to a DWORD 1 value and reboot.  Then the system will save stack traces
so the guilty driver can be identified.  There is no other way to find out
which driver is neglecting to clean up the I/Os.

A bugcheck DRIVER_USED_EXCESSIVE_PTES will then occur if the system runs out of
PTEs again and the offending driver's name will be printed.

TARGET_MDL_TOO_SMALL             (0x40)

A driver has called the IoBuildPartialMdl() function and passed it an MDL
to map part of a source MDL, but the target MDL is not large enough to map
the entire range of addresses requested.  This is a driver bug.  The source
and target MDLs, as well as the address range length to be mapped are the
arguments to the IoBuildPartialMdl() function, i.e.;

    IoBuildPartialMdl(
        IN PMDL SourceMdl,
        IN OUT PMDL TargetMdl,
        IN PVOID VirtualAddress,
        IN ULONG Length
        )

MUST_SUCCEED_POOL_EMPTY          (0x41)

PARAMETERS
        1 - size of the request that could not be satisfied
        2 - number of pages used of nonpaged pool
        3 - number of > PAGE_SIZE requests from nonpaged pool
        4 - number of pages available

DESCRIPTION
No component should ever ask for must-succeed pool as if there is none left,
the system crashes.  Instead, components should ask for normal pool and
gracefully handle the scenario where the pool is temporarily empty.  This
bugcheck definitely reveals a bug in the caller (use kb to identify the caller).
In addition, the fact that the pool is empty may be either a transient condition
or possibly a leak in another component (distinguish between the 2 cases by
following the directions below).

Type kb to show the calling stack.
Type !vm 1 to display total pool usage.
Then type !poolused 2 to display per-tag nonpaged pool usage.
Then type !poolused 4 to display per-tag paged pool usage.
The crash should be looked at by the tag owner that is consuming the most pool.

ATDISK_DRIVER_INTERNAL           (0x42)

NO_SUCH_PARTITION                (0x43)

MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS   (0x44)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Address of the IRP

DESCRIPTION
A driver has requested that an IRP be completed (IoCompleteRequest()), but
the packet has already been completed.  This is a tough bug to find because
the easiest case, a driver actually attempted to complete its own packet
twice, is generally not what happened.  Rather, two separate drivers each
believe that they own the packet, and each attempts to complete it.  The
first actually works, and the second fails.  Tracking down which drivers
in the system actually did this is difficult, generally because the trails
of the first driver have been covered by the second.  However, the driver
stack for the current request can be found by examining the DeviceObject
fields in each of the stack locations.

DEREF_UNKNOWN_LOGON_SESSION      (0x46)

REF_UNKNOWN_LOGON_SESSION        (0x47)

CANCEL_STATE_IN_COMPLETED_IRP    (0x48)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Pointer to the IRP
    2 - Cancel routine set by the driver.

DESCRIPTION
This bugcheck indicates that an I/O Request Packet (IRP) that is to be
cancelled, has a cancel routine specified in it -- meaning that the packet
is in a state in which the packet can be cancelled -- however, the packet
no longer belongs to a driver, as it has entered I/O completion.  This is
either a driver bug, or more than one driver is accessing the same packet,
which is not likely and much more difficult to find. The cancel routine
parameter will provide a clue as to which driver or stack is the culprit.

PAGE_FAULT_WITH_INTERRUPTS_OFF   (0x49)

IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE   (0x4A)

Returning to usermode from a system call at an IRQL > PASSIVE_LEVEL.
PARAMETERS
    1 - Address of system function (system call routine)
    2 - Current IRQL
    3 - 0
    4 - 0

STREAMS_INTERNAL_ERROR           (0x4B)

FATAL_UNHANDLED_HARD_ERROR       (0x4C)

If a hard error occurs during system booting before windows is up, and
the hard error is a real error, the system will blue screen crash.


Some common cases are:

    x218 - This means a necessary registry hive file could not be
           loaded.  The obvious reason is if it is corrupt or missing.
           In this case, either the Emergency Repair Disk or a
           reinstall is required.

           Some less obvious reasons are that the driver has corrupted
           the registry data while loading into memory, or the memory
           where the registry file was loaded is not actually memory.

    x21a - This means that either winlogon, or csrss (windows) died
           unexpectedly.  The exit code tells more information.  Usually
           it is c0000005 meaning that an unhandled exception crashed
           either of these processes.

    x221 - This means that a driver is corrupt, or a system DLL was
           detected to be corrupt.

           Safeboot or boot an alternate OS (or reinstall)
           and then make sure the on disk file that is listed as bad
           matches the version on CD and replace if necessary.  In some
           cases, random corruption can mean that there is a hardware
           problem in the I/O path to the file.

NO_PAGES_AVAILABLE               (0x4D)
PARAMETERS
        1 - Total number of dirty pages
        2 - Number of dirty pages destined for the pagefile(s).
        3 - Internal flags.
        4 - Most recent modified write error status.

DESCRIPTION
No free pages available to continue operations.
If kernel debugger available "!vm 3".

        This bugcheck can occur for the following reasons:

        1.  A driver has blocked, deadlocking the modified or mapped
            page writers.  Examples of this include mutex deadlocks or
            accesses to paged out memory in filesystem drivers, filter
            drivers, etc.  This indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 1 or 2 is large, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!vm 3" in the kernel debugger.

        2.  The storage driver(s) are not processing requests.  Examples
            of this are stranded queues, non-responding drives, etc.  This
            indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 1 or 2 is large, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!process 0 7" in the kernel debugger.

        3.  Not enough pool is available for the storage stack to write out
            modified pages.  This indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 3 is small, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!vm" and "!poolused 2" in the kernel debugger.

        4.  A high priority realtime thread has starved the balance set
            manager from trimming pages and/or starved the modified writer
            from writing them out.  This indicates a bug in the component
            that created this thread.

            This one is hard to determine, try "!ready"

        5.  All the processes have been trimmed to their minimums and all
            modified pages written, but still no memory is available.  The
            freed memory must be stuck in transition pages with non-zero
            reference counts - thus they cannot be put on the freelist.
            A driver is neglecting to unlock the pages preventing the
            reference counts from going to zero which would free the pages.
            This may be due to transfers that never finish and the driver
            never aborts or other driver bugs.

            If parameter 4 is large, then this is a possibility.  But it
            is very hard to find the driver.  Try "!process 0 1" and look
            for any that have a lot of locked pages.

If the problem cannot be found, then try booting with /DEBUG and a kernel
debugger attached, so if it reproduces, a debug session can be initiated
to identify the cause.

PFN_LIST_CORRUPT                 (0x4E)
PARAMETERS
    1 -
    VALUES:
      1 : A list head was corrupt
        2 - ListHead value which was corrupt
        3 - number of pages available
        4 - 0
      2 : A list entry was corrupt
        2 - entry in list being removed
        3 - highest physical page number
        4 - reference count of entry being removed
      7 : A driver has unlocked a page more times than it locked it
        2 - page frame number
        3 - current share count
        4 - 0
      0x8F : The free or zeroed page listhead is corrupt
        2 - new page
        3 - old page
        4 - 0
      0x99 : A PTE or PFN is corrupt
        2 - page frame number
        3 - current page state
        4 - 0
    END_VALUES


DESCRIPTION
Typically caused by drivers passing bad memory descriptor lists (ie: calling
MmUnlockPages twice with the same list, etc).  If a kernel debugger is
available get the stack trace.


NDIS_INTERNAL_ERROR              (0x4F)

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA      (0x50)
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced.
        2 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
        3 - If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
            address.
        4 - (reserved)

DESCRIPTION
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
is pointing at freed memory.

REGISTRY_ERROR                   (0x51)
PARAMETERS
        1 - (reserved)
        2 - (reserved)
        3 - depends on where Windows bugchecked, may be pointer to hive
        4 - depends on where Windows bugchecked, may be return code of
            HvCheckHive if the hive is corrupt.

DESCRIPTION
Something has gone badly wrong with the registry.  If a kernel debugger
is available, get a stack trace. It can also indicate that the registry got
an I/O error while trying to read one of its files, so it can be caused by
hardware problems or filesystem corruption.

It may occur due to a failure in a refresh operation, which is used only
in by the security system, and then only when resource limits are encountered.

XNS_INTERNAL_ERROR               (0x57)

FTDISK_INTERNAL_ERROR            (0x58)

The system was booted from a revived primary partition so
the hives say the mirror is ok, when in fact it is not.
The "real" image of the hives are on the shadow.
The user must boot from the shadow.

PINBALL_FILE_SYSTEM              (0x59)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM (0x23)

HAL_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x5C)

UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR            (0x5D)
    386 - System failed because the processor is only a 386 or
    compatible.  The system requires a Pentium (or higher) compatible processor.

MEMORY1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED    (0x65)

CACHE_INITIALIZATION_FAILED      (0x66)

CONFIG_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x67)

PARAMETERS
    1 - (reserved)
    2 - location selector
    3 - NT status code

DESCRIPTION
This means the registry couldn't allocate the pool needed to contain the
registry files.  This should never happen, since it is early enough in
system initialization that there is always plenty of paged pool available.

FILE_INITIALIZATION_FAILED       (0x68)

IO1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x69)

Initialization of the I/O system failed for some reason.  There is
very little information available.  In general, setup really made
some bad decisions about the installation of the system, or the user has
reconfigured the system.

LPC_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x6A)

PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6B)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that caused the failure.
    2 - (reserved)

REFMON_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x6C)

SESSION1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6D)
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that caused the failure.

DESCRIPTION
The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the point during
initialization when the failure was detected.

SESSION2_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6E)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into thinking
        that initialization failed.

DESCRIPTION
The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the point during
initialization when the failure was detected.

SESSION3_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6F)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into thinking
        that initialization failed.

DESCRIPTION
The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the point during
initialization when the failure was detected.

SESSION4_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x70)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into thinking
        that initialization failed.

DESCRIPTION
The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the point during
initialization when the failure was detected.

SESSION5_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x71)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into thinking
        that initialization failed.

DESCRIPTION
The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the point during
initialization when the failure was detected.

ASSIGN_DRIVE_LETTERS_FAILED      (0x72)

CONFIG_LIST_FAILED               (0x73)
Indicates that one of the core system hives cannot be linked in the
registry tree. The hive is valid, it was loaded OK. Examine the 2nd
bugcheck argument to see why the hive could not be linked in the
registry tree.

PARAMETERS
        1 - 1
        2 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into
            thinking that it had failed to load the hive.
        3 - Index of hive in hivelist
        4 - Pointer to UNICODE_STRING containing filename of hive

DESCRIPTION
This can be either SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE or DEFAULT. One common reason
for this to happen is if you are out of disk space on the system drive
(in which case param 2 is 0xC000017D - STATUS_NO_LOG_SPACE) or an attempt
to allocate pool has failed (in which case param 2 is 0xC000009A -
STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES). Other status codes must be individually
investigated.


BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO           (0x74)
Can indicate that the SYSTEM hive loaded by the osloader/NTLDR
was corrupt.  This is unlikely, since the osloader will check
a hive to make sure it isn't corrupt after loading it.

It can also indicate that some critical registry keys and values
are not present.  (i.e. somebody used regedt32 to delete something
that they shouldn't have)  Booting from LastKnownGood may fix
the problem, but if someone is persistent enough in mucking with
the registry they will need to reinstall or use the Emergency
Repair Disk.

PARAMETERS
        1 - (reserved)
        2 - (reserved)
        3 - (reserved)
        4 - usually the NT status code.

CANNOT_WRITE_CONFIGURATION       (0x75)

This will result if the SYSTEM hive file cannot be converted to a
mapped file. This usually happens if the system is out of pool and
we cannot reopen the hive.

PARAMETERS
        1 - 1
        2 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped Windows into
            thinking that it had failed to convert the hive.

DESCRIPTION
Normally you shouldn't see this as the conversion happens at early
during system initialization, so enough pool should be available.

PROCESS_HAS_LOCKED_PAGES         (0x76)
PARAMETERS
        1 - 0
        2 - process address
        3 - number of locked pages
        4 - pointer to driver stacks (if enabled) or 0 if not.

DESCRIPTION
Caused by a driver not cleaning up completely after an I/O.  Set
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\TrackLockedPages
to a DWORD 1 value and reboot.  Then the system will save stack traces
so the guilty driver can be identified.  There is no other way to find out
which driver is neglecting to clean up the I/Os.  When you enable this flag,
if the driver commits the error again you will see a different
bugcheck - DRIVER_LEFT_LOCKED_PAGES_IN_PROCESS (0xCB) - which can identify the
offending driver(s).

KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR        (0x77)
PARAMETERS
        1 - status code
        2 - i/o status code
        3 - page file number
        4 - offset into page file

   1 - status code
   VALUES:
     0 : (page was retrieved from page cache)
        2 - value found in stack where signature should be
        3 - 0
        4 - address of signature on kernel stack

     1 : (page was retrieved from disk)
        2 - value found in stack where signature should be
        3 - 0
        4 - address of signature on kernel stack

     2 : (page was retrieved from disk, storage stack returned SUCCESS,
            but the Status.Information != PAGE_SIZE)
        2 - value found in stack where signature should be
        3 - 0
        4 - address of signature on kernel stack

     3 : (page was retrieved from disk, but storage stack returned STATUS_END_OF_FILE,
            for a pagefile read)
        2 - faulting virtual address
        3 - the internal memory management inpage block
        4 - 0

     4 : (page was retrieved from disk, storage stack returned SUCCESS,
            but the Status.Information != request size for a pagefile read)
        2 - faulting virtual address
        3 - the internal memory management inpage block
        4 - 0
     END_VALUES


DESCRIPTION
The requested page of kernel data could not be read in.  Caused by
bad block in paging file or disk controller error.

In the case when the first and second arguments are 0, the stack signature
in the kernel stack was not found.  Again, bad hardware.

An I/O status of c000009c (STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR) or
C000016AL (STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED)  normally indicates
the data could not be read from the disk due to a bad
block.  Upon reboot autocheck willl run and attempt to map out the bad
sector.  If the status is C0000185 (STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR) and the paging
file is on a SCSI disk device, then the cabling and termination should be
checked.  See the knowledge base article on SCSI termination.

PHASE0_EXCEPTION                 (0x78)

MISMATCHED_HAL                   (0x79)
PARAMETERS
    1 - type of mismatch
    VALUES:
        1:
            The PRCB release levels mismatch.  (something is out of date)
            2 - Major PRCB level of ntoskrnl.exe
            3 - Major PRCB level of hal.dll

        2:
            The build types mismatch.
            2 - Build type of ntoskrnl.exe
            3 - Build type of hal.dll

                Build type
                    0 = Free multiprocessor enabled build
                    1 = Checked multiprocessor enabled build
                    2 = Free uniprocessor build

        3:
            The loader (ntldr) and hal versions mismatch.
            2 - Size of the loader parameter extension
            3 - MajorVersion of the loader parameter extension
            4 - MinorVersion of the loader parameter extension

     END_VALUES


DESCRIPTION
The HAL revision level and HAL configuration type does not match that
of the kernel or the machine type.  This would probably happen if the
user has manually updated either ntoskrnl.exe or hal.dll and managed to
get a conflict.

You have an MP (multi-processor) Hal and a UP (uni-processor) Kernel,
or the reverse.



KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR         (0x7A)
PARAMETERS
        1 - lock type that was held (value 1,2,3, or PTE address)
        2 - error status (normally i/o status code)
        3 - current process (virtual address for lock type 3, or PTE)
        4 - virtual address that could not be in-paged

DESCRIPTION
The requested page of kernel data could not be read in.  Typically caused by
a bad block in the paging file or disk controller error. Also see
KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR.

If the error status is 0xC000000E, 0xC000009C, 0xC000009D or 0xC0000185,
it means the disk subsystem has experienced a failure.

If the error status is 0xC000009A, then it means the request failed because
a filesystem failed to make forward progress.




INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE         (0x7B)
PARAMETERS
    1 - Pointer to the device object or Unicode string of ARC name

DESCRIPTION
During the initialization of the I/O system, it is possible that the driver
for the boot device failed to initialize the device that the system is
attempting to boot from, or it is possible for the file system that is
supposed to read that device to either fail its initialization or to simply
not recognize the data on the boot device as a file system structure that
it recognizes.  In the former case, the argument (#1) is the address of a
Unicode string data structure that is the ARC name of the device from which
the boot was being attempted.  In the latter case, the argument (#1) is the
address of the device object that could not be mounted.

If this is the initial setup of the system, then this error can occur if
the system was installed on an unsupported disk or SCSI controller.  Note
that some controllers are supported only by drivers which are in the Windows
Driver Library (WDL) which requires the user to do a custom install.  See
the Windows Driver Library for more information.

This error can also be caused by the installation of a new SCSI adapter or
disk controller or repartitioning the disk with the system partition.  If
this is the case, on x86 systems the boot.ini file must be edited or on ARC
systems setup must be run.  See the "Advanced Server System Administrator's
User Guide" for information on changing boot.ini.

If the argument is a pointer to an ARC name string, then the format of the
first two (and in this case only) longwords will be:

    USHORT Length;
    USHORT MaximumLength;
    PWSTR Buffer;

That is, the first longword will contain something like 00800020 where 20
is the actual length of the Unicode string, and the next longword will
contain the address of buffer.  This address will be in system space, so
the high order bit will be set.

If the argument is a pointer to a device object, then the format of the first
word will be:

    USHORT Type;

That is, the first word will contain a 0003, where the Type code will ALWAYS
be 0003.

Note that this makes it immediately obvious whether the argument is a pointer
to an ARC name string or a device object, since a Unicode string can never
have an odd number of bytes, and a device object will always have a Type
code of 3.

UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP      (0x7F)

This means a trap occurred in kernel mode, and it's a trap of a kind
that the kernel isn't allowed to have/catch (bound trap) or that
is always instant death (double fault).  The first number in the
bugcheck parens is the number of the trap (8 = double fault, etc)
Consult an Intel x86 family manual to learn more about what these
traps are. Here is a *portion* of those codes:

NMI_HARDWARE_FAILURE             (0x80)

This is typically due to a hardware malfunction.  The hardware supplier should
be called.

SPIN_LOCK_INIT_FAILURE           (0x81)

DFS_FILE_SYSTEM                  (0x82)

SETUP_FAILURE                    (0x85)

(NOTE:  Textmode setup no longer uses bugchecks to bail out of serious
error conditions.  Therefore, you will never encounter a bugcheck 0x85.
All bugchecks have been replaced with friendlier and (where possible)
more descriptive error messages.  Some of the former bugchecks, however,
have simply been replaced by our own bugcheck screen, and the codes for
these error conditions are the same as before.  These are documented below.)

The first extended bugcheck field is a code indicating what the
problem is, and the other fields are used differently depending on
that value.
PARAMETERS
    1 -
        VALUES:
        0:  The oem hal font is not a valid .fon format file, and so setup
            is unable to display text.
            This indicates that vgaxxx.fon on the boot floppy or CD-ROM
            is damaged.

        1:  Video initialization failed.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            This error now has its own error screen, and the user is only
            presented with the two relevant parameters detailed below.

            This may indicate that the disk containing vga.sys
            (or other video driver appropriate to the machine)
            is damaged or that machine has video hardware that
            Windows cannot communicate with.

            3 - Status code from NT API call, if appropriate.

            2 - What failed:
            VALUES:
                0 : NtCreateFile of \device\video0
                1 : IOCTL_VIDEO_QUERY_NUM_AVAIL_MODES
                2 : IOCTL_VIDEO_QUERY_AVAIL_MODES
                3: Desired video mode not supported.  This is indicative of
                   an internal setup error.
                4: IOCTL_VIDEO_SET_CURRENT_MODE (unable to set video mode)
                5: IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY
                6: IOCTL_VIDEO_LOAD_AND_SET_FONT
            END_VALUES

        2:  Out of memory.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            This error now uses a more friendly error screen that works
            regardless of how far along in setup Windows is.

        3:  Keyboard initialization failed.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            There are now 2 error screens for the two different possible errors
            that can occur here.
            This may indicate that the disk containing the keyboard driver
            (i8042prt.sys or kbdclass.sys) is damaged, or that the machine has
            keyboard hardware Windows cannot communicate with.

            It may also mean that the keyboard layout dll could not be loaded.

            2 - What failed:
            VALUES:
                0: NtCreateFile of \device\KeyboardClass0 failed.
                   "Setup did not find a keyboard connected to your computer."
                1: Unable to load keyboard layout dll.
                   "Setup could not load the keyboard layout file <filename>."
                   Indicates that the cd or floppy is missing a file (kbdus.dll
                   for us release, other layout dlls for localized ones).
            END_VALUES

        4:  Setup was unable to resolve the ARC device pathname of
            the device from which setup was started. This is an internal
            Setup error.

        5:  Partitioning sanity check failed.  This indicates a bug in
            a disk driver.  The parameters are meaningful only to the setup
            group.

        END_VALUES

MBR_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH            (0x8B)

This message occurs during the boot process when the MBR checksum the system
calculates does not match the checksum passed in by the loader. This is usually
an indication of a virus. There are many forms of viruses and not all can be
detected. The newer ones usually can only be detected by a virus scanner that
has recently been upgraded. Boot a write-protected disk containing a virus
scanner and attempt to clean out the infection.

PARAMETERS

    1 - Disk Signature from MBR.
    2 - MBR checksum calculated by osloader.
    3 - MBR checksum calculated by system.

KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED      (0x8E)
PARAMETERS
    1 - The exception code that was not handled
    2 - The address that the exception occurred at
    3 - Trap Frame

DESCRIPTION
This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
/NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
happening.

An exception code of 0x80000002 (STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT) indicates
that an unaligned data reference was encountered.  The trap frame will
supply additional information.

Play Manager failed.

PP1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x90)

This message occurs if phase 1 initialization of the kernel-mode Plug and
Play Manager failed.  This is where most of the initialization is done,
including setting up the environment (registry, etc.) for drivers to
subsequently call during I/O init.


UP_DRIVER_ON_MP_SYSTEM           (0x92)

This message occurs if a UNIPROCESSOR only driver is loaded on a MultiProcessor
system with more than one active processor.

This message occurs if kernel code (server, redirector, other driver, etc.)
attempts to close a handle that is not a valid handle.

PARAMETERS

    1 - The handle that NtClose was called with.

    2 -
    VALUES
        0 : means a protected handle was closed.
        1 : means an invalid handle was closed.
    END_VALUES

KERNEL_STACK_LOCKED_AT_EXIT     (0x94)

This message occurs when a thread exits while its kernel stack is
marked as not swapable

INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM         (0x96)

This message occurs when KeRemoveQueue removes a queue entry whose flink
or blink field is null.  This is almost always called by code misusing
worker thread work items, but any queue misuse can cause this.  The rule
is that an entry on a queue may only be inserted on the list once. When an
item is removed from a queue, it's flink field is set to NULL. This bugcheck
occurs when remove queue attempts to remove an entry, but the flink or blink
field is NULL. In order to debug this problem, you need to know the queue being
referenced.

In an attempt to help identify the guilty driver, this bugcheck assumes the
queue is a worker queue (ExWorkerQueue) and prints the worker routine as
parameter 4 below.

PARAMETERS

    1 - The address of the queue entry whose flink/blink field is NULL
    2 - The address of the queue being references. Usually this is one
        of the ExWorkerQueues.
    3 - The base address of the ExWorkerQueue array. This will help determine
        if the queue in question is an ExWorkerQueue and if so, the offset from
        this parameter will isolate the queue.
    4 - If this is an ExWorkerQueue (which it usually is), this is the address
        of the worker routine that would have been called if the work item was
        valid. This can be used to isolate the driver that is misusing the work
        queue.


BOUND_IMAGE_UNSUPPORTED         (0x97)

USER_MODE_HEALTH_MONITOR        (0x9E)

One or more critical user mode components failed to satisfy a health check.

Hardware mechanisms such as watchdog timers can detect that basic kernel
services are not executing. However, resource starvation issues, including
memory leaks, lock contention, and scheduling priority misconfiguration,
may block critical user mode components without blocking DPCs or
draining the nonpaged pool.

Kernel components can extend watchdog timer functionality to user mode
by periodically monitoring critical applications. This bugcheck indicates
that a user mode health check failed in a manner such that graceful
shutdown is unlikely to succeed. It restores critical services by
rebooting and/or allowing application failover to other servers.

PARAMETERS
    1 - Process that failed to satisfy a health check within the
        configured timeout
    2 - Health monitoring timeout (seconds)

DESCRIPTION
This bug check covers a great variety of ACPI problems.  If a kernel debugger
is attached, use "!analyze -v".  This command will analyze the precise problem,
and display whatever information is most useful for debugging the specific
error.

BAD_EXHANDLE                    (0xA7)

The kernel mode handle table detected an inconsistent handle table
entry state.

SESSION_HAS_VALID_POOL_ON_EXIT  (0xAB)
PARAMETERS
        1 - session ID
        2 - number of paged pool bytes that are leaking
        3 - number of nonpaged pool bytes that are leaking
        4 - total number of paged and nonpaged allocations that are leaking.
            nonpaged allocations are in the upper half of this word,
            paged allocations are in the lower half of this word.

DESCRIPTION
Caused by a session driver not freeing its pool allocations prior to a
session unload.  This indicates a bug in win32k.sys, atmfd.dll,
rdpdd.dll or a video driver.

HAL_MEMORY_ALLOCATION           (0xAC)

The HAL was unable to obtain memory for a system critical requirement.
These allocations are made early in system initialization and such a
failure is not expected.  It probably indicates some other critical error
such as pool corruption or massive consumption.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Allocation size.
        2 - 0
        3 - Pointer to string containing file name.
        4 - (reserved)

VIDEO_DRIVER_INIT_FAILURE       (0xB4)

The system was not able to go into graphics mode because no display drivers
were able to start.  This usually occurs if no video miniport drivers load
successfully.

ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC       (0xB8)

A wait operation, attach process, or yield was attempted from a DPC routine.
This is an illegal operation and the stack track will lead to the offending
code and original DPC routine.

CHIPSET_DETECTED_ERROR          (0xB9)

SESSION_HAS_VALID_VIEWS_ON_EXIT  (0xBA)
PARAMETERS
        1 - session ID
        2 - number of mapped views that are leaking
        3 - address of this session's mapped views table
        4 - size of this session's mapped views table.

DESCRIPTION
Caused by a session driver not unmapping its mapped views prior to a
session unload.  This indicates a bug in win32k.sys, atmfd.dll,
rdpdd.dll or a video driver.

NETWORK_BOOT_INITIALIZATION_FAILED  (0xBB)
PARAMETERS
    1 - the part of network initialization that failed
    2 - the failure status
DESCRIPTION
Caused if we are booting off the network, and a critical function fails during
IO initialization. Currently the codes for the first value are:
1 - updating the registry.
2 - starting the network stack - Windows sends IOCTLs to the redirector and
    datagram receiver, then waits for the redirector to be ready. If it is not
    ready within a certain period of time, initialization fails.
3 - failed sending the DHCP IOCTL to TCP - this is how Windows informs the
    transport of its IP adress.

NETWORK_BOOT_DUPLICATE_ADDRESS  (0xBC)
PARAMETERS
    1 - the IP address, show as a hex DWORD. So an address aa.bb.cc.dd will
        appear as 0xddccbbaa.
    2 - the hardware address of the other machine.
    3 - the hardware address of the other machine.
    4 - the hardware address of the other machine. For Ethernet, a MAC address
        of aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff will be indicated by the second parameter
        containing 0xaabbccdd, the third parameter containing 0xeeff0000, and
        the fourth parameter containing 0x00000000.
DESCRIPTION
This indicates that when TCP/IP sent out an ARP for its IP address, it got
a response from another machine, indicating a duplicate IP address. When we
are booting off the network this is a fatal error.

INVALID_HIBERNATED_STATE    (0xBD)
The hibernated memory image does not match the current hardware configuration.
This bugcheck occurs when a system resumes from hibernate and discovers that the
hardware has been changed while the system was hibernated.

Note:  This bug check no longer exists in any version of Windows.

PARAMETERS
    1 - hardware that was invalid
        VALUES:
        1 : Number of installed processors is less than before the hibernation
            2 - number of processors before hibernation
            3 - number of processors after hibernation
        END_VALUES

ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY    (0xBE)
An attempt was made to write to readonly memory.  The guilty driver is on the
stack trace (and is typically the current instruction pointer).

PARAMETERS
    1 - Virtual address for the attempted write.
    2 - PTE contents.
    3 - (reserved)
    4 - (reserved)

DESCRIPTION
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.

DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION         (0xC4)

A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught.  This is
because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the

DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL           (0xC5)
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - IRQL
        3 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
        4 - address which referenced memory

DESCRIPTION
An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.  This is
caused by drivers that have corrupted the system pool.  Run the driver
verifier against any new (or suspect) drivers, and if that doesn't turn up
the culprit, then use gflags to enable special pool.

DRIVER_CAUGHT_MODIFYING_FREED_POOL           (0xC6)
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
        3 - previous mode.
        4 - 4.

DESCRIPTION
An attempt was made to access freed pool memory.  The faulty component is
displayed in the current kernel stack.

A kernel timer or DPC was found in memory which must not contain such items.
Usually this is memory being freed.  This is usually caused by a device driver
that has not cleaned up properly before freeing memory.

PARAMETERS
        1 - What kind of object
            0   Timer Object
            1   DPC Object
            2   DPC Routine

IRQL_UNEXPECTED_VALUE                                   (0xC8)

The processor's IRQL is not what it should be at this time.  This is
usually caused by a lower level routine changing IRQL for some period
and not restoring IRQL at the end of that period (eg acquires spinlock
but doesn't release it).

PARAMETERS
        1 - (Current IRQL << 16) | (Expected IRQL << 8) | UniqueValue
DESCRIPTION
        if UniqueValue is 0 or 1
            2 = APC->KernelRoutine
            3 = APC
            4 = APC->NormalRoutine

                3 - A pointer to the IRP.
                4 - A pointer to the DeviceObject.
        0x201 : (Fatal error) A device is deleting itself while there is another device
                beneath it in the driver stack. This may be because the caller has forgotten to call
                 IoDetachDevice first, or the lower driver may have incorrectly deleted itself.

        0x202 : (Fatal error) A driver has attempted to detach from a device object that
                is not attached to anything. This may occur if detach was called twice on the same
                 device object. (Device object specified.)

        0x203 : (Fatal error) A driver has called IoCallDriver without setting the
                CancelRoutine in the IRP to NULL. (IRP specified.)

        0x204 : (Fatal error) The caller has passed in NULL as a DeviceObject. This
                is fatal. (IRP specified.)

        0x205 : (Fatal error) The caller is forwarding an IRP that is currently queued beneath
                it. The code handling IRPs returning STATUS_PENDING in this driver appears to be
                 broken. (IRP specified.)

        0x206 : (Fatal error) The caller has incorrectly forwarded an IRP (control field
                not zeroed). The driver should use IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext or
                IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation. (IRP specified.)

        0x207 : (Fatal error) The caller has manually copied the stack and has inadvertently
                 copied the upper layer's completion routine. Please use
                 IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext. (IRP specified.)

        0x208 : (Fatal error) This IRP is about to run out of stack locations. Someone
                may have forwarded this IRP from another stack. (IRP specified.)

        0x209 : (Fatal error) The caller is completing an IRP that is currently queued
                 beneath it. The code handling IRPs returning STATUS_PENDING in this driver appears
                  to be broken. (IRP specified.)

        0x20A : (Fatal error) The caller of IoFreeIrp is freeing an IRP that is still
                in use. (Original IRP and IRP in use specified.)

        0x20B : (Fatal error) The caller of IoFreeIrp is freeing an IRP that is still
                in use. (IRP specified.)

        0x20C : (Fatal error) The caller of IoFreeIrp is freeing an IRP that is still
                queued against a thread. (IRP specified.)

        0x20D : (Fatal error) The caller of IoInitializeIrp has passed an IRP that was
                allocated with IoAllocateIrp. This is illegal and unnecessary, and has caused
                a quota leak. Check the documentation for IoReuseIrp if this IRP is being recycled.

        0x20E : (Non-fatal error) A PNP IRP has an invalid status. (Any PNP IRP must
                have its status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.) (IRP specified.)

        0x20F : (Non-fatal error) A Power IRP has an invalid status. (Any Power IRP
                must have its status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.) (IRP specified.)

        0x210 : (Non-fatal error) A WMI IRP has an invalid status. (Any WMI IRP must
                have its status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.) (IRP specified.)

        0x211 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has forwarded an IRP while skipping a device
                 object in the stack. The caller is probably sending IRPs to the PDO instead of
                  to the device returned by IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack. (IRP specified.)

        0x212 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has trashed or has not properly copied the
                IRP's stack. (IRP specified.)

        0x213 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has changed the status field of an IRP it
                does not understand. (IRP specified.)

        0x214 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has changed the information field of an
                IRP it does not understand. (IRP specified.)

        0x215 : (Non-fatal error) A non-successful non-STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED IRP status
                for IRP_MJ_PNP is being passed down stack. (IRP specified.) Failed PNP IRPs
                must be completed.

        0x216 : (Non-fatal error) The previously-set IRP_MJ_PNP status has been converted
                to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. (IRP specified.)

        0x217 : (Non-fatal error) The driver has not handled a required IRP. The driver must
                update the status of the IRP to indicate whether or not it has been handled.
                (IRP specified.)

        0x218 : (Non-fatal error) The driver has responded to an IRP that is reserved for
                other device objects elsewhere in the stack. (IRP specified.)

        0x219 : (Non-fatal error) A non-successful non-STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED IRP status for
                IRP_MJ_POWER is being passed down stack. (IRP specified.) Failed POWER IRPs must be
                completed.

        0x21A : (Non-fatal error) The previously-set IRP_MJ_POWER status has been converted
                to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. (IRP specified.)

        0x21B : (Non-fatal error) A driver has returned a suspicious status. This is probably
                 due to an uninitialized variable bug in the driver. (IRP specified.)

        0x21C : (Warning) The caller has copied the IRP stack but not set a completion routine.
                This is inefficient -- use IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation instead. (IRP specified.)

        0x21D : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler has not properly detached from the
                stack below it upon receiving a remove IRP. (DeviceObject, Dispatch
                 Routine, and IRP specified.)

        0x21E : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler has not properly deleted its device object
                upon receiving a remove IRP. (DeviceObject, Dispatch Routine, and IRP specified.)

        0x21F : (Non-fatal error) A driver has not filled out a dispatch routine for a required
                IRP major function. (IRP specified.)

        0x220 : (Non-fatal error) IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL has been completed by someone other than
                the ProviderId. This IRP should either have been completed earlier or should have
                been passed down. (IRP specified, along with the DeviceObject where it was targeted.)

        0x221 : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler for a PDO has deleted its device object,
                but the hardware has not been reported as missing in a bus relations query.
                (DeviceObject, Dispatch Routine, and IRP specified.)

        0x222 : (Fatal error) A Bus Filter's IRP dispatch handler has detached upon receiving
                a remove IRP when the PDO is still alive. Bus Filters must clean up in
                FastIoDetach callbacks. (DeviceObject, Dispatch Routine, and IRP specified.)

        0x223 : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler for a bus filter has deleted its device
                object, but the PDO is still present. Bus filters must clean up in
                FastIoDetach callbacks. (DeviceObject, Dispatch Routine, and IRP specified.)

        0x224 : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler has returned a status that is inconsistent
                 with the IRP's IoStatus.Status field. (Dispatch handler routine, IRP, IRP's
                 IoStatus.Status, and returned Status specified.)

        0x225 : (Non-fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler has returned a status that is illegal
                (0xFFFFFFFF). This is probably due to an uninitialized stack variable. To debug
                this, execute an LN command on the specified address.

        0x226 : (Fatal error) An IRP dispatch handler has returned without passing down or
                completing this IRP, or someone forgot to return STATUS_PENDING. (IRP specified.)

        0x227 : (Fatal error) An IRP completion routine is in pageable code. (This is never
                permitted.) (Routine and IRP specified.)

        0x228 : (Non-fatal error) A driver's completion routine has not marked the IRP pending if
                the PendingReturned field was set in the IRP passed to it. This may cause the
                OS to hang, especially if an error is returned by the stack. (Routine and IRP specified.)

        0x229 : (Fatal error) A cancel routine has been set for an IRP that is currently being
                processed by drivers lower in the stack, possibly stomping their cancel routine.
                (Routine and IRP specified.)

        0x22A : (Non-fatal error) The physical device object (PDO) has not responded to a
                required IRP. (IRP specified.)

        0x22B : (Non-fatal error) The physical device object (PDO) has forgotten to fill out the
                device relation list with the PDO for the TargetDeviceRelation query. (IRP specified.)

        0x22C : (Fatal error) The code implementing the TargetDeviceRelation query has not called
                ObReferenceObject on the PDO. (IRP specified.)

        0x22D : (Non-fatal error) The caller has completed a IRP_MJ_PNP it didn't understand
                instead of passing it down. (IRP specified.)

        0x22E : (Non-fatal error) The caller has completed a successful IRP_MJ_PNP instead of
                 passing it down. (IRP specified.)

        0x22F : (Non-fatal error) The caller has completed an untouched IRP_MJ_PNP (instead of
                passing the IRP down), or non-PDO has failed the IRP using illegal value of
                STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. (IRP specified.)

        0x230 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has completed an IRP_MJ_POWER it didn't understand
                instead of passing it down. (IRP specified.)

        0x231 : (Fatal error) The caller has completed a successful IRP_MJ_POWER instead of passing
                 it down. (IRP specified.)

        0x232 : (Non-fatal error) The caller has completed an untouched IRP_MJ_POWER (instead of
                passing the IRP down), or non-PDO has failed the IRP using illegal value of
                STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. (IRP specified.)

        0x233 : (Non-fatal error) The version field of the query capabilities structure in a query
                capabilities IRP was not properly initialized. (IRP specified.)

        0x234 : (Non-fatal error) The size field of the query capabilities structure in a query
                capabilities IRP was not properly initialized. (IRP specified.)

        0x235 : (Non-fatal error) The address field of the query capabilities structure in a query
                capabilities IRP was not properly initialized to -1. (IRP specified.)

        0x236 : (Non-fatal error) The UI Number field of the query capabilities structure in a
                 query capabilities IRP was not properly initialized to -1. (IRP specified.)

        0x237 : (Fatal error) A driver has sent an IRP that is restricted for system use only. (IRP specified.)

        0x238 : (Warning) The caller of IoInitializeIrp has passed an IRP that was allocated with
                IoAllocateIrp. This is illegal, unnecessary, and negatively impacts performance in normal
                use. Check the documentation for IoReuseIrp if this IRP is being recycled.

        0x239 : (Warning) The caller of IoCompleteRequest is completing an IRP that has never
                been forwarded via a call to IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver. This may be
                a bug. (IRP specified.)

        0x23A : (Fatal error) A driver has forwarded an IRP at an IRQL that is illegal for
                this major code. (IRP specified.)

        0x23B : (Non-fatal error) The caller has changed the status field of an IRP it does not
                understand. (IRP specified.)


        0x23C : (Fatal error) A driver has completed an IRP without setting the cancel
                routine in the IRP to NULL. (IRP specified.)

        0x23D : (Non-fatal error) A driver has returned STATUS_PENDING but did not mark the IRP
                pending via a call to IoMarkIrpPending. (IRP specified.)

        0x23E : (Non-fatal error) A driver has marked an IRP pending but didn't return
                STATUS_PENDING. (IRP specified.)

        0x23F : (Fatal error) A driver has not inherited the DO_POWER_PAGABLE bit from the
                stack it has attached to. (DeviceObject specified.)

        0x240 : (Fatal error) A driver is attempting to delete a device object that has already
                been deleted via a prior call to IoDeleteDevice.

        0x241 : (Fatal error) A driver has detached its device object during a surprise remove
                IRP. (IRP and DeviceObject specified.)

        0x242 : (Fatal error) A driver has deleted its device object during a surprise remove
                 IRP. (IRP and DeviceObject specified.)

                the end of AddDevice. (DeviceObject specified.)

        0x244 : (Fatal error) A driver has not copied either the DO_BUFFERED_IO or the
                DO_DIRECT_IO flag from the device object it is attaching
                to. (DeviceObject specified.)

        0x245 : (Fatal error) A driver has set both the DO_BUFFERED_IO and the DO_DIRECT_IO
                flags. These flags are mutually exclusive. (DeviceObject specified.)

        0x246 : (Fatal error) A driver has failed to copy the DeviceType field from the device
                object it is attaching to. (DeviceObject specified.)

        0x247 : (Fatal error) A driver has failed an IRP that cannot legally be failed. (IRP specified.)

        0x248 : (Fatal error) A driver has added a device object that is not a PDO to a device
                relations query. (IRP and DeviceObject specified.)

        0x249 : (Non-fatal error) A driver has enumerated two child PDOs that returned identical
                Device IDs. (Both DeviceObjects specified.)

        0x24A : (Fatal error) A driver has mistakenly called a file I/O function at an IRQL
                other than PASSIVE_LEVEL.

        0x24B : (Fatal error) A driver has succeeded IRP_MJ_PNP.IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS(TargetRelations)
                but did not properly fill out the request or forward the IRP to the underlying

PNP_DETECTED_FATAL_ERROR                    (0xCA)

PnP encountered a severe error, either as a result of a problem in a driver or
a problem in PnP itself.  The first argument describes the nature of the
problem, the second argument is the address of the PDO.  The other arguments
vary depending on argument 1.

PARAMETERS
        Argument 1 -
        VALUES:
        1 : Duplicate PDO

                A specific instance of a driver has enumerated multiple PDOs with
                identical device id and unique ids.

                2 - Newly reported PDO.

                3 - PDO of which it is a duplicate.

        2 : Invalid PDO

                An API which requires a PDO has been called with either an FDO,
                a PDO which hasn't been initialized yet (returned to PnP in a
                QueryDeviceRelation/BusRelations), or some random piece of
                memory.

                2 - Purported PDO.

                3 - Driver object

        3 : Invalid ID

                An enumerator has returned an ID which contains illegal
                characters or isn't properly terminated.  IDs must only contain
                characters in the range 0x20-7F inclusive with the exception of
                0x2C (comma) which is illegal.

                2 - PDO whose IDs were queried

                3 - Address of ID buffer

                4 - Type of ID
                VALUES
                        1 : DeviceID
                        2 : UniqueID
                        3 : HardwareIDs
                        4 : CompatibleIDs
                END_VALUES

        4 : Invalid enumeration of deleted PDO

                An enumerator has returned a PDO which it has previously deleted
                using IoDeleteDevice.

                2 - PDO with DOE_DELETE_PENDING set.

        5 : PDO freed while still linked in devnode tree.

                The object manager reference count on a PDO dropped to zero
                while the devnode was still linked in the tree.  This usually
                indicates that the driver is not adding a reference when
                returning the PDO in a query IRP.

                2 - PDO.
        END_VALUES



DRIVER_LEFT_LOCKED_PAGES_IN_PROCESS     (0xCB)
PARAMETERS
        1 - The calling address in the driver that locked the pages or if the
            IO manager locked the pages this points to the dispatch routine of

The broken driver's name is displayed on the screen.
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
        3 - If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
            address.
        4 - Mm internal code.

DRIVER_CORRUPTED_MMPOOL     (0xD0)
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - IRQL
        3 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
        4 - address which referenced memory

An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.  This is
caused by drivers that have corrupted the system pool.  Run the driver
verifier against any new (or suspect) drivers, and if that doesn't turn up
the culprit, then use gflags to enable special pool.  You can also set
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\ProtectNonPagedPool
to a DWORD 1 value and reboot.  Then the system will unmap freed nonpaged pool,
preventing drivers (although not DMA-hardware) from corrupting the pool.

PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - IRQL

DRIVER_CORRUPTED_SYSPTES           (0xDB)
PARAMETERS
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - IRQL
        3 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
        4 - address which referenced memory

DESCRIPTION
An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.  This is
caused by drivers that have corrupted system PTEs.  Set
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\TrackPtes
to a DWORD 3 value and reboot.  Then the system will save stack traces and
perform validity checks so the guilty driver can be identified.
There is no other way to find out which driver did this.  When you enable
this flag, if the driver commits the error again you will see a different
bugcheck - SYSTEM_PTE_MISUSE - and the stack trace will identify the offending
driver(s).

DRIVER_INVALID_STACK_ACCESS                   (0xDC)

A driver accessed a stack address that lies below the stack pointer of the
stack's thread.

POOL_CORRUPTION_IN_FILE_AREA                  (0xDE)

A driver corrupted pool memory used for holding pages destined for disk.
This was discovered by the memory manager when dereferencing the file.

IMPERSONATING_WORKER_THREAD                    (0xDF)

A workitem forgot to disable impersonation before it completed.

PARAMETERS
    1 - Worker Routine that caused this bugcheck.
    2 - Parameter passed to this worker routine.
    3 - Pointer to the Workitem.

ACPI_BIOS_FATAL_ERROR                         (0xE0)

Your computer (BIOS) has reported that a component in your system is too faulty
for Windows to be able to run.

You can determine which component is faulty by running the diagnostic disk or
tool that came with your computer.

If you do not have this tool, you must contact your system vendor and report
this error message to them.  They will be able to assist you in correcting this
hardware problem, thereby allowing Windows to operate.  Microsoft cannot assist
in the debugging of this problem -- only the hardware vendor can interpret the
bug check parameters and debug this error.

WORKER_THREAD_RETURNED_AT_BAD_IRQL            (0xE1)
PARAMETERS
        1 - address of worker routine (do ln on this to find guilty driver)

WORKER_INVALID                                (0xE4)

If Parameter1 == 0:

A executive worker item was found in memory which must not contain such
items.  Usually this is memory being freed.  This is usually caused by
a device driver that has not cleaned up properly before freeing memory.

PARAMETERS
        1 - 0
        2 - Address of worker item
        3 - Start of pool block
        4 - End of pool block

If Parameter1 == 1:

An attempt was made to queue an executive work item with a WorkerRoutine
that referenced a usermode memory address.  This is usually caused by a
device driver attempting to queue an invalid work item.  The offending
driver will be on the stack.

        1 - 1
        2 - Address of worker item
        3 - Address of WorkerRoutine

                   written outside of its allocation.
            0x18 : Adapter already released. A DMA operation has been
                   attempted using an adapter that no longer exists.
            0x19 : The driver passed a null DMA_ADAPTER value to a
                   HAL routine.
            0x1B : The driver passed an address and an MDL to a HAL
                   routine, but this address is not contained in
                   this MDL.
            0x1D : The driver attempted to map an address that was
                   already mapped.

            is not set or some of the reserved bits are non-zero.  Second
            argument is the flags field.

        1 : The current processor interrupt priority level (IRQL) is not
            the same as when the floating point context was saved.
            Second argument is saved IRQL, third is current IRQL.

        2 : The saved context does not belong to the current thread.
            Second argument is the saved address of the thread this
            floating point context belongs to, third argument is the
            current thread.
    END_VALUES


INVALID_CANCEL_OF_FILE_OPEN                    (0xE8)

The fileobject passed to IoCancelFileOpen is invalid. It should have reference
of 1. The driver that called IoCancelFileOpen is at fault.

PARAMETERS
    1 - FileObject passed to IoCancelFileOpen
    2 - DeviceObject passed to IoCancelFileOpen

ACTIVE_EX_WORKER_THREAD_TERMINATION           (0xE9)

An executive worker thread is being terminated without having gone through
the worker thread rundown code.  A stack trace should indicate the cause.

PARAMETERS
        1 - The exiting ETHREAD.

THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER                 (0xEA)

The device driver is spinning in an infinite loop, most likely waiting for
hardware to become idle. This usually indicates problem with the hardware
itself or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Pointer to a stuck thread object.  Do .thread then kb on it to find
            the hung location.
        2 - Pointer to a DEFERRED_WATCHDOG object.
        3 - Pointer to offending driver name.
        4 - Number of times this error occurred.  If a debugger is attached,
            this error is not always fatal -- see DESCRIPTION below.  On the
            blue screen, this will always equal 1.

DESCRIPTION

If the kernel debugger is connected and running when watchdog detects a
timeout condition then DbgBreakPoint() will be called instead of KeBugCheckEx()
and detailed message including bugcheck arguments will be printed to the
debugger. This way we can identify an offending thread, set breakpoints in it,
and hit go to return to the spinning code to debug it further. Because
KeBugCheckEx() is not called the .bugcheck directive will not return bugcheck
information in this case. The arguments are already printed out to the kernel
debugger. You can also retrieve them from a global variable via
"dd watchdog!g_WdBugCheckData l5" (use dq on NT64).

On MP machines it is possible to hit a timeout when the spinning thread is
interrupted by hardware interrupt and ISR or DPC routine is running at the time
of the bugcheck (this is because the timeout's work item can be delivered and
handled on the second CPU and the same time). If this is the case you will have
to look deeper at the offending thread's stack (e.g. using dds) to determine
spinning code which caused the timeout to occur.


THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER_M                 (0x100000EA)

The device driver is spinning in an infinite loop, most likely waiting for
hardware to become idle. This usually indicates problem with the hardware
itself or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Pointer to a stuck thread object.  Do .thread then kb on it to find
            the hung location.
        2 - Pointer to a DEFERRED_WATCHDOG object.
        3 - Pointer to offending driver name.
        4 - Number of times "intercepted" bugcheck 0xEA was hit (see notes).

DESCRIPTION

If the kernel debugger is connected and running when watchdog detects a
timeout condition then DbgBreakPoint() will be called instead of KeBugCheckEx()
and detailed message including bugcheck arguments will be printed to the
debugger. This way we can identify an offending thread, set breakpoints in it,
and hit go to return to the spinning code to debug it further. Because
KeBugCheckEx() is not called the .bugcheck directive will not return bugcheck
information in this case. The arguments are already printed out to the kernel
debugger. You can also retrieve them from a global variable via
"dd watchdog!g_WdBugCheckData l5" (use dq on NT64).

On MP machines it is possible to hit a timeout when the spinning thread is
interrupted by hardware interrupt and ISR or DPC routine is running at the time
of the bugcheck (this is because the timeout's work item can be delivered and
handled on the second CPU and the same time). If this is the case you will have
to look deeper at the offending thread's stack (e.g. using dds) to determine
spinning code which caused the timeout to occur.



DIRTY_MAPPED_PAGES_CONGESTION                 (0xEB)
PARAMETERS
        1 - Total number of dirty pages
        2 - Number of dirty pages destined for the pagefile(s).
        3 - Internal flags.
        4 - Most recent modified write error status.

DESCRIPTION
No free pages available to continue operations.

If kernel debugger available, type "!vm 3".

        This bugcheck usually occurs for the following reasons:

        1.  A driver has blocked, deadlocking the modified or mapped
            page writers.  Examples of this include mutex deadlocks or
            accesses to paged out memory in filesystem drivers, filter
            drivers, etc.  This indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 1 or 2 is large, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!vm 3" in the kernel debugger.

        2.  The storage driver(s) are not processing requests.  Examples
            of this are stranded queues, non-responding drives, etc.  This
            indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 1 or 2 is large, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!process 0 7" in the kernel debugger.

        3.  Not enough pool is available for the storage stack to write out
            modified pages.  This indicates a driver bug.

            If parameter 3 is small, then this is a possibility.  Type
            "!vm" and "!poolused 2" in the kernel debugger.

SESSION_HAS_VALID_SPECIAL_POOL_ON_EXIT  (0xEC)
PARAMETERS
        1 - session ID

HARDWARE_INTERRUPT_STORM (0xF2)

Note:  This bug check no longer exists in any version of Windows.

PARAMETERS
     1 - address of the ISR (or first ISR in the chain) connected to the storming interrupt vector
     2 - ISR context value
     3 - address of the interrupt object for the storming interrupt vector
     4 - 0x1 if the ISR is not chained, 0x2 if the ISR is chained

DESCRIPTION
This bugcheck will show up on the screen when the kernel
detects an interrupt "storm".  An interrupt storm is defined as a level
triggered interrupt signal staying in the asserted state.  This is fatal
to the system in the manner that the system will hard hang, or "bus lock".

This can happen because of the following:

 -  A piece of hardware does not release its interrupt signal after being told
    to do so by the device driver
 -  A device driver does not instruct its hardware to release the interrupt
    signal because it does not believe the interrupt was initiated from its
    hardware
 -  A device driver claims the interrupt even though the interrupt was not
    initiated from its hardware.  Note that this can only occur when multiple
    devices are sharing the same IRQ.
 -  The ELCR (edge level control register) is set incorrectly.
 -  Edge and Level interrupt triggered devices share an IRQ (e.g. COM port and
    PCI SCSI controller).

All of these cases will instantly hard hang your system.  Instead of hard
hanging the system, this bugcheck is initiated since in many cases it can
identify the culprit.

When the bugcheck occurs, the module containing the ISR (interrupt service
routine) of the storming IRQ is displayed on the screen.  This is an
example of what you would see:

*** STOP: 0x000000F2 (0xFCA7C55C, 0x817B9B28, 0x817D2AA0, 0x00000002)

An interrupt storm has caused the system to hang.

*** Address FCA7C55C base at FCA72000, Datestamp 3A72BDEF - ACPI.sys

In the event the fourth parameter is a 0x00000001, the module pointed to
is very likely the culprit.  Either the driver is broken, or the hardware
is malfunctioning.

In the event the fourth parameter is a 0x00000002, the module pointed to
is the first ISR in the chain, and is never guaranteed to be the culprit.
A user experiencing this bugcheck repeatedly should try to isolate the
problem by looking for devices that are on the same IRQ as the one for
which the module is a driver for (in this case, the same IRQ that ACPI
is using).  In the future, we may be able to list all devices on a
chained ISR.


DISORDERLY_SHUTDOWN               (0xF3)

No free pages available to continue operations.

Because applications are not terminated and drivers are
not unloaded, they can continue to access pages even after
the modified writer has terminated.  This can cause the
system to run out of pages since the pagefile(s) cannot be used.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Total number of dirty pages
        2 - Number of dirty pages destined for the pagefile(s).
        3 - Internal flags.
        4 - Most recent modified write error status.


CRITICAL_OBJECT_TERMINATION       (0xF4)

A process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited or been
terminated.

Several processes and threads are necessary for the operation of the
system; when they are terminated (for any reason), the system can no
longer function.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Terminating object type
            VALUES:
                3 : Process
                6 : Thread

              defined

            Parm 2 - The CallBackData associated with this operation

        103 : An internal object ran out of space and the system is unable to
              allocate new space.

            Parm 2 - The CallBackData associated with this operation
            Parm 4 - The error associated with the operation

        104 : Unexpected failure referencing an object

            Parm 2 - The handle we are trying to reference
            Parm 4 - The status of the OB reference operation

        106 : Attempt to cancel an open file which is not allowed.

            Parm 2 - The file object we are trying to cancel
        END_VALUES

                3 : A driver has written to OS controlled portions of a PCI device's config space
            END_VALUES


DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER       (0xF7)

A driver has overrun a stack-based buffer.  This overrun could potentially
allow a malicious user to gain control of this machine.

DESCRIPTION

A driver overran a stack-based buffer (or local variable) in a way that would
have overwritten the function's return address and jumped back to an arbitrary
address when the function returned.  This is the classic "buffer overrun"
hacking attack and the system has been brought down to prevent a malicious user
from gaining complete control of it.

Do a kb to get a stack backtrace -- the last routine on the stack before the
buffer overrun handlers and bugcheck call is the one that overran its local
variable(s).

RAMDISK_BOOT_INITIALIZATION_FAILED  (0xF8)

An initialization failure occurred while attempting to boot from the RAM disk.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Action that failed
            VALUES:

STATUS_REPARSE should be returned only for Create requests with trailing names
as that indicates the driver is supporting name spaces.

PARAMETERS
        1 - Device object that was opened.
        2 - Device object to which the Create IRP was issued.
        3 - New name of the file (to be reparsed) (UNICODE string)
        4 - Information returned by the driver for the Create IRP

recover.

PARAMETERS
        1 - State identifier
        VALUES:
            1 : A work item is invalid. This will eventually result in
                  corruption of the thread pool and an access violation.

is on the stack trace (and is typically the current instruction pointer).

PARAMETERS
    1 - Virtual address for the attempted execute.
    2 - PTE contents.
    3 - (reserved)
    4 - (reserved)

DESCRIPTION
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.

DIRTY_NOWRITE_PAGES_CONGESTION                (0xFD)
PARAMETERS
        1 - Total number of dirty pages
        2 - Number of nowrite dirty pages.
        3 - Internal flags.
        4 - Most recent modified write error status.

DESCRIPTION
No free pages available to continue operations.

If kernel debugger available, type "!vm 3 and !memusage 1".

        This bugcheck usually occurs because the component owning the
        modified nowrite pages failed to write out these pages after
        marking the relevant files as dont-write to memory management.
        This indicates a driver bug.

BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER                            (0xFE)
PARAMETERS
        1 - USB Bugcheck Code:
VALUES

               hardware failure.

        4 : IRP_URB_DOUBLE_SUBMIT The caller has submitted an irp 
               that is already pending in the USB bus driver.
        
            2 - Address of IRP
            3 - Address of URB

AGP_ILLEGALLY_REPROGRAMMED                (0x106)

The AGP HW has been reprogrammed by an unauthorized agent.
This is most likely caused by an unsigned, or improperly tested video driver.
Check video manufacturer's web site for updated display drivers, or use
VGA-mode.

PARAMETERS

Dependency Walker Version 2.0 Beta 5 Release Notes
Steve P. Miller (stevemil@microsoft.com)
October 20, 1999

What's New in Version 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Detection of dynamically loaded modules, including details about which module
   actually called LoadLibrary to dynamically load the module.
*  Detection of dynamically called functions, including details about which
   module actually called GetProcAddress() to obtain the function address.
*  Detection of delay-load dependencies. This is a new type of dependency that
   was introduced with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. They work on Windows 9x,
   Windows NT, and Windows 2000.
*  Support for 64-bit Windows modules.
*  Console mode that allows Dependency Walker to be ran without its graphical
   interface being displayed.  This is useful for batch files and unattended
   automation of Dependency Walker features.
*  Command line options to configure module search order, column sorting, output
   files, profiling, and other settings.
*  Ability to monitor module entrypoints (like DllMain) looking for module
   initialization failures.
*  C++ function name undecorating to provide human readable C++ function
   prototypes including function names, return types, and parameter types.
*  User definable module search paths with support for "KnownDLLs" and the
   "App Paths" registry keys.  Search paths can be saved and loaded from within
   the graphical interface or from the command line.
*  Ability to save a module's session to a text report file for easy viewing in
   any text viewer.
*  Ability to save a module's session to a comma separated value (CSV) file for
   easy importing into other applications.
*  Ability to save a snapshot of a module's session to an image file, which can
   be loaded by Dependency Walker at a later time on any computer.
*  Module profiling to detect dynamic dependencies, child processes, thread
   activity, and exceptions. Child processes can also be profiled for their
   dependencies.
*  Ability to control what file extensions Dependency Walker will add the
   "View Dependencies" menu item to a file's context menu in explorer.
*  Added hotkeys to help match imports with exports, and modules in the list
   view with modules in the tree view.  Also added a hotkeys to locate the
   previous, next, or original instance of a module in the tree view.
*  Added some new columns to the Module List View. They include Link Time Stamp,
   Link Checksum, Real Checksum, Symbols, Actual Base, Virtual Size, and Load
   Order.
*  Added an OS Information dialog. This information is also saved to text and
   DWI files.
*  All list views can now be sorted by icon, which provides an easy way of
   grouping items of similar type.
*  You can now search all list views for text by simply typing in a few
   characters to match in the currently sorted column.
*  Added color-coding to the module list view and log view to help highlight
   problems.

WRK v1.2

The Windows Research Kernel v1.2 contains the sources for the core of
the Windows (NTOS) kernel and a build environment for a kernel that will run on
    x86     (Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1) and
    AMD64   (Windows XP x64 Professional)
A future version may also support booting WRK kernels on Windows XP x86 systems,
but the current kernels will fail to boot due to differences in some shared structures.

The NTOS kernel implements the basic OS functions
for processes, threads, virtual memory and cache managers, I/O management,
the registry, executive functions such as the kernel heap and synchronization,
the object manager, the local procedure call mechanism, the security reference
monitor, low-level CPU management (thread scheduling, Asynchronous and Deferred
Procedure calls, interrupt/trap handling, exceptions), etc.

The NT Hardware Abstraction Layer, file systems, network stacks, and device
drivers are implemented separately from NTOS and loaded into kernel mode
as dynamic libraries.  Sources for these dynamic components are not included
in the WRK, but some are available in various development kits published
by Microsoft, such as the Installable File System (IFS) Kit and the
Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK).

WRK v1.2 includes most of the NTOS kernel sources from the latest released
version of Windows, which supports the AMD64 architecture on the Desktop.
The kernel sources excluded from the kit are primarily in the areas of
plug-and-play, power management, the device verifier, kernel debugger
interface, and virtual dos machine.  The primary modifications to WRK
from the released kernel are related to cleanup and removal of server
support, such as code related to the Intel IA64.

***

Organization of the WRK sources

The file License.txt contains the license covering use of the WRK.

The public\ directory contains a number of include files shared among system
components.  base\ntos\ contains the NTOS sources.

The primary NTOS source components included in the WRK are organized as follows:

    cache\  - cache manager
    config\ - registry implementation
    dbgk\   - user-mode debugger support
    ex\     - executive functions (kernel heap, synchronization, time)
    fsrtl\  - file system run-time support
    io\     - I/O manager
    ke\     - scheduler, CPU management, low-level synchronization
    lpc\    - local procedure call implementation
    mm\     - virtual memory manager
    ob\     - kernel object manager
    ps\     - process/thread support
    se\     - security functions
    wmi\    - Windows Management Instrumentation

    inc\    - NTOS-only include files
    rtl\    - kernel run-time support
    init\   - kernel startup

Building/deploying a WRK kernel for x86 [or amd64]

    0. Copy the WRK into a directory, say %wrk%.  
    1. set arch=x86 [or amd64]
    2. path %wrk%\tools\%arch%;%path%
    3. cd %wrk%\base\ntos
    4. nmake -nologo %arch%=
        will produce kernel files in BUILD\EXE\%arch%
        [wrkx86.* or wrkx64.*]
    5. copy the kernel to %SystemRoot%\system32\
    6. if x86, find the Multi-processor version of hal.dll [see below]
    7. add a line to C:\boot.ini of the target system
        to boot this kernel and the MP hal [see below]
    8. reboot and select the boot option for the new kernel
    9. you will boot up on a kernel you built/linked yourself!
        [always keep the original boot.ini line and kernel/hal available so you
         can still boot your system if something fails with your WRK kernel modifications]
    10. set up a debugger [see below]

Multi-processor hal (x86 only, amd64 hals are all MP)
    All hals are renamed hal.dll, so you have to use the link command to
    see what type of hal hal.dll really is:
        link -dump -all hal.dll | findstr pdb
    The MP hals have an 'm' in the native name of the hal, e.g. halmacpi.dll
    You may already have an MP hal installed on UP systems, due to hyperthreading.
    If the hal isn't MP, you need to find the MP hal that corresponds to the current hal
    the target system does have, i.e. 
        halacpi.dll  -> halacpim.dll    ; ACPI PIC-based PC  [used by VirtualPC]
        halaacpi.dll -> halmacpi.dll    ; ACPI APIC-based PC
        halapic.dll  -> halmps.dll      ; MPS
    Look in the WRK WS03SP1HALS\x86 directory for the MP hal you need.

Boot.ini
    Edit boot.ini (you may have to use attrib -h -s -r first)
    Copy the line for the first operating system listed to the end of the file and edit it.
        [boot loader]
        timeout=30
        default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINDOWS
        [operating systems]
        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINDOWS="Windows Server 2003, Standard"
        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINDOWS="test" /kernel=wrkx86.exe /hal=halmacpi.dll
    Note that the filenames must be short (8.3) names.
    You can add additional options for debugging (as specified in the WinDbg/KD help).

Debugging WRK
    The WinDBG/KD debuggers will work with the WRK.  The documentation is pretty thorough, and
    includes information about how to debug across a serial port, locally (examining kernel 
    data from user-mode), and debugging kernels running on VirtualPC.

    Version 6.6.3.5 of the WinDBG/KD debuggers is available with the Curriculum Resource Kit
    Tools ("CurriculumResourceKit-CRK\CRKTools\Debugging Tools" directory on the CD).  
    The latest version of the Windows Debugging Tools can be downloaded from
    http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging.

Installation Copy sdscc.dll from the release share (  HYPERLINK "\\\\ptt\\release\\sd\\"  \\ptt\release\sd\ ) to a directory on your local machine. Run regsvr32.exe on your local copy of sdscc.dll. Uninstallation Run regsvr32.exe /u on your local copy of sdscc.dll. Usage Please consult the user manual for your IDE for information on how to use its source control features. Important Notes The user interface is presented by the host application.  The plugin is merely the glue that lets the IDE interact with a source control system, and has little or no control over the user experience.  The only dialogs presented by the plugin itself are: SD Submit Comments: This dialog is displayed when checking in files. SD Check Out Options: When checking out a file, this dialog is displayed if (in Visual Studio) you click the Advanced  button in the Check out files  dialog. SD File History: This dialog is displayed when (e.g., in Visual Studio) you use the Project  gin does not lock files on checkout.  This means if someone else checks in the file while you have it checked out, you will not be able to submit from the host application until you use the SD command line tool to sync and resolve the change. You can configure the plugin to lock files on checkout, to ensure other users cannot check in the file while you have it checked out.  However, this does not prevent other users from checking out the file. To enable locking, do the following (e.g., in Visual Studio): updated on   SAVEDATE \@ "MMM. d, yyyy 'at' h:mm am/pm" \* MERGEFORMAT  Jan. 17, 2001 at 5:02 PM  TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT  SDSCC Plugin for Visual Studio page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

It contains the following sections: Document Conventions Specifying Files, Directories and Patterns Specifying Version Numbers Specifying File Types Alphabetical Reference to SLM Commands Document Conventions In this chapter, symbols and typefaces have the following significance:  [  ] Square brackets contain optional items Literal text (exactly what you would type in) is printed in a monotype font. files Descriptive text is printed in italics Alternatives are separated by a vertical bar The term   is used here to describe the type of argument preceded by a dash or hyphen, such as -a. A flag may also be referred to in general parlance as a switch, option, option flag, or option switch.  Specifying Files, Directories, and Patterns When using most SLM commands, you can specify what files, sets of files, and/or directories that you want the command to work on. Most such file or directory specifications appear at the end of the command line as general arguments, not associated with a particular flag. In the case of several commands, file specifications may be followed by an   sign and a version specifier. General arguments of this kind can take the form of individual file names, directory names, or patterns containing wildcard characters ( They can include relative path information, provided that the directory pointed to is enlisted in the project. A relative path specifies how to get to the directory in question from the current directory, and may include the   and   directory symbols. Absolute path specifications, such as  \ADIR C:\PROJ  are not allowed (remember that SLM is dealing with parallel project trees located in different places on your local drive and on the server). Normal MS-DOS file conventions apply. Directories should be separated by a backslash ( More than one argument of this kind can be included with a single command, provided that the arguments are separated by space characters. Below are examples of each type of these general arguments. file(s) One or more specific filenames, including relative path information if necessary. Examples: afile.c a file in the current directory subdir\afile.h a file in a subdirectory ..\sidedir\xfile.c a file in a neighboring directory afile.c bfile.c several files, separated by spaces directory(s) One or more directory names, including relative path information if necessary. Examples: a subdirectory of the current one adir\bdir a subdirectory of a subdirectory ..\sidedir\xdir a relative path using  adir afile.c bdir a file and two directories pattern(s) One or more file or directory specifications containing one or more wildcard symbols ( ), and including relative path information if necessary. Unlike MS-DOS, SLM will generally accept wildcard symbols within a relative path. Examples: *.c  *.h all files with ".c" or   extensions make*.txt all ".txt" files that start with "make" ..\sidedir\*.c a relative path using  rev2??b.* files like "rev295b.c" or "rev2xyb.doc" ???src\*.c all .c files in subdirectories like prgsrc  and  libsrc file(s)@when One or more file names or patterns followed by an "at" sign ("@") and a file-version, a proj-ver-number, a proj-ver-name, a date, or a date@time (see the next section for a detailed description of these elements). Examples: afile.c@v47 file version number 47 of afile.c *.c@v-3  files 3 file-versions back afile.c@12-31-91 version as of 12/31/91 at 12:00:01 am afile.c@.-7@15:30 version 7 days ago at 3:30 pm afile.c@beta version with release name "beta" sdir\*.h@1.50.03 release 1.50.03 of certain ".h" files Wildcard Patterns with the  -a  and  -r  Flags Using the -a (all) flag with a command instructs SLM to apply that command in all directories enlisted in the project. Using the -r flag with a command instructs SLM to apply that command in all target directories  recursively,  that is, in a target directory, in any subdirectories it may contain, in any subdirectories that they in turn contain, and so on. Target directories are specified as [file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s)] arguments, or sometimes as a subdirectory element of a project specification using the -p flag. If no other target directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. In many commands, the -a and -r flags accept an optional pattern argument, such as -r *.c, which SLM treats differently than a pattern included as a part of the normal [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument. The following rules govern the use of such patterns: The -a and -r flags can accept only one argument. SLM recognizes the pattern to be an argument of the flag by the fact that it contains one or more wildcard characters ( ). Anything not containing wildcards, SLM parses as a new flag or other argument. A pattern included as an argument to the -a or -r flag is applied in every subdirectory addressed using that flag. In other words, the SLM command processes every file in those subdirectories which matches the pattern argument. A pattern included as an argument to the -a or -r flag may not contain any path information. By contrast, a pattern included in the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument is only applied and matched in the current directory (or, if a project subdirectory is specified using the -p flag, the pattern is applied and matched only in that directory). On the other hand, such a pattern may include relative path information. Examples Assume a local root project directory named PROJ, with various enlisted subdirectories including one named CODE (the current directory), which in turn contains several enlisted subdirectories.  C:\PROJ\CODE>out -vr *.c Checks out all files with a   extension that reside in the current directory (CODE), and in all subdirectories of CODE, and in any subdirectories under them. The   is treated here as an argument of the -r flag. The -v (verbose) flag instructs SLM to report its actions in detail as it performs them. C:\PROJ\CODE>out -rv *.c Because -r is followed by something other than a pattern (the -v flag), SLM assumes that the -r flag does not take a pattern here. It then checks out any files in the current directory having a   extension, and if there are any subdirectories of the current directory that have a   extension, SLM checks out all files of any kind in those subdirectories and in all subdirectories beneath them. C:\PROJ\CODE>out -vr *.c prgsrc Once again, the   is treated as an argument of the -r flag. If there is a subdirectory named PRGSRC in the current directory, SLM checks out all files with a   extension that reside in that subdirectory and in any subdirectories beneath it. If there is a file named PRGSRC in the current directory, SLM checks that file out, along with all files having a   exten-sion that reside in the current directory and in any subdirectories beneath it. Note You can use either the -a flag or the -r flag, but not both. This is because the flags cannot accept two separate patterns.  For example, if you entered C:\PROJ\CODE>out -va *.c -r *.h, you might expect SLM to check out all files in the project having a   extension, and all files in the current directory and its subdirectories having a   extension. Instead, SLM replaces the   pattern with the   pattern, subsumes the -r flag in the -a, and only checks out all   files in the project. Specifying Version Numbers Certain SLM commands allow you to specify what versions of files or of the project as a whole the command is to work on. Version information can take several different forms. file-version This expression refers to the version number automatically generated by SLM for each file in a project, expressed as a number preceded by a  .  When a file is first added, SLM initializes its version number to v1, and then, each time the file changes, SLM increases the version number by one, up to an upper limit of 32,767. In commands, a positive number following the   indicates an absolute version number, but a negative number indicates the number of versions to go back from the current one.  For example, if the current version is v77, then v-6 refers to v71. The current version can be determined using the status -x command. proj-ver-number The number assigned to a specific release of a project, in the form major.minor[.revision], and automatically maintained by SLM. Examples: same as version 1.50.00 1.50.02 major = 1; minor =50; revision =2 proj-ver-name An alphanumeric name identifying a particular project version. Examples: 88000 A date in the form m-d  or m-d-y, or a   expression in the form .[-days]. In a dot expression, the dot or period ( ) denotes either today or the start date, depending on the context. Normally, .-3 means 3 days ago. Examples: 12-31 December 31 of this year 1-1-92 January 1, 1992 today 7 days before today This kind of argument can take various forms: Simply a date specification, as described above. date@h:m[:s] A date specification followed by an "at" sign ("@") and a time. proj-ver-number A project version number, as described above. @proj-ver-name  sign ( ) followed by a project version name, as described above If a date is specified without a time, the first second of the day is assumed, unless the date@time is the second one of a range, in which case the last second of the day is assumed. Examples: 1-31@23:30 on Jan. 31 of this year at 11:30 pm .@9:30 today at 9:30 am .-1@17:00 yesterday at 5:00 pm release version 1.50.00 2.00.01 release version 2.00.01 @beta release version named "beta" Specifying File Types SLM treats project files differently depending on their SLM type. There are three main types of project file (text, binary and unrecoverable), and one special-purpose file type (version). Both text and binary files are referred to as recoverable, because SLM maintains for them a complete history of every version checked in. (text) Text files are files for which SLM maintains a complete change history in the form of difference, or   records. SLM allows more than one person to edit a text file at a time. In general, text files should contain lines of text separated by carriage-return/ line-feed pairs, and should not contain characters outside of the standard printable ASCII character set. Text files are usually created using program editors such as PWB or Brief, or standard text editors such as the DOS 5.0 edit utility and Windows Notepad. Note that Word documents and Excel spread-sheets are not text files in this sense. (binary) Binary files are files for which SLM maintains change history by storing a full copy of each version checked in. No merging service is available for binary file edits. To make a file s type binary, you must explicitly declare it binary using the -tb flag with the addfile or sadmin settype commands. In general, binary files have contents and/or format which prevent them from being treated reliably as text files (see above), but still need to have full change history maintained. Because SLM keeps a complete copy of every version of a binary file that is checked in, documentation files should generally not be treated as binary files, to conserve server disk space. (unrecoverable) Unrecoverable files are files for which SLM maintains change history only when a version is checked in using the -k flag. No merging service is available for unrecoverable file edits. Unless in -k is used, each new version of an unrecoverable file replaces the previous one, which is then lost forever. When you add a file to an SLM project, SLM scans the file for non-text characters. If it finds any, it automatically adds the file as unrecoverable, unless you have specifically requested otherwise, using -tb or -tt. In general, unrecoverable files have contents and/or format which prevent them from being treated reliably as text files (see above), and are too large and/or frequently edited to be maintained as binary files. Although a text file may be made unrecoverable, storing change history in diff format is relatively efficient, so project administrators can usually afford to keep a complete change history in text type. (version) These are "include" files created specifically for programmers. Because SLM maintains these files, they cannot be checked out. A version file is a language-specific include file containing information about the project and its current version. The command, addfile -tv, is used to create these files.  Version files have three possible formats. In the following examples, let's suppose that your name is Murphy, that your project is currently in release 2.50.09, and that the release is being called beta5_9. If the version file is created with a .C or .H extension, its contents are formatted to be useful to C-language programmers: #define rmj 2 /* release "major" component */ #define rmm 50 /* release "minor" component */ #define rup 9 /* release "revision" component; 0 if unused */ #define szVerName "beta5_9" /* release version name, in quotes */ #define szVerUser "Murphy" /* your name, in quotes */ If the version file was created with an .ASM or .INC extension, its contents are formatted to be useful to assembly-language programmers: ; release "major" component ; release "minor" component ; release "revision" component; ;  0 if unused szVerName "beta5_9", 0 ; release version name, in quotes szVerUser "Murphy", 0 ; your name, in quotes If the version file was created with any other extension than the ones mentioned above, its contents are formatted as a single ASCII line in the form: major.minor.revision name you. In our example, this would be: 2.50.09 beta5_9 Murphy SLM automatically updates a project's version file(s) as the version changes. The project version can be set using sadmin release, and thereafter, as soon as any change is made to any of the project files, SLM increments (increases by one) the revision number. For example, in the example above, after the project administrator had released the project as 2.50.09, then the next time anyone on the team checked a changed file back in, the version would automatically change to 2.50.10. The project version would then remain at 2.50.10 until the next explicit release. The project version number can also be set using sadmin setpv. SLM Commands The remainder of this chapter is an alphabetic reference to all the SLM commands. addfile Syntax Adds new files and directories to a project addfile [-&fhv!] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-t b|t|u|v] [-r [pattern]]  [-c "comment"] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). The SLM root directory must contain the three system subdirectories, SRC, DIFF, and ETC. -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -r [pattern] Recursive; adds files to the project from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)| directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.asm is included, adds only files which match the pattern. -t b|t|u|v Specifies the SLM   for all files being added: b = binary, t text, u = unrecoverable, and v = version file. For a description of these file types, see page 16. -c "comment" Records a comment explaining the reason for adding the file(s). Use -c to add the same comment to a number of files (otherwise, you will be prompted for a comment for each file individually). file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The file(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, and/or directory(s) that you wish to add to the project. If one or more directories are specified, they will be added without their contents unless the -r flag is included. For more information about this kind of argument, see page 12. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Use addfile to add new files and directories to the project.  The files are copied from your local directory to the SLM master source directory, and each added file is recorded in the log and set to version 1. Use addfile -r directory to add a directory and all of its contents to a project.  If the -r flag is not specified, the directory is added to the project, but its contents are not. When SLM adds files to your project, it will mark your local copies as read-only, unless you use the -s and -p flags to add a file from an unenlisted directory. SLM treats different types of files differently. When you add a file to a project, you can either specify the file type, or let SLM assign it automatically. If no -t option is given, and the file contains only text characters, its type will be assigned as text, but if it contains one or more non-text characters, its type will be assigned as unrecoverable. It is important to understand that the terms  recoverable  and  unrecoverable  refer to the way SLM normally treats a file s earlier versions, not to an absolute characteristic of the file. SLM automatically saves all previous versions of a recoverable file, and normally overwrites and destroys each previous version of an unrecoverable file when you check in a new one. Notice, however, that you can choose to delete previous versions of recoverable files using sadmin deldiff, and that you can use in -k to save versions of an unrecoverable file for future recovery. Any file, regardless of its contents, can be made recoverable by adding it as binary type, with the -tb flag. SLM will then save a complete copy of each and every version of that file. Files are also divided into two categories based on their contents. If a file contains only characters within the standard printable ASCII character set, it is said to be a text file; otherwise, it is a non-text, or binary file. In practice, text files are generally created using a standard text editor such as the MS-DOS 5.0 edit utility, the Windows Notepad, or a program editor such as PWB or Brief. A few examples of files that are not text files are Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, bitmaps, object files, and executable files.  SLM treats all unrecoverable files in the same way. However, if you want a file to be recoverable, SLM treats text and binary files differently. SLM normally saves old versions of text files as a series of differences from the current version, whereas it saves a complete copy of each version of a binary file. If large files are checked in and out fairly often, the binary file versions can consume a very large amount of disk space. Files with non-text contents are therefore usually added to a project as unrecoverable files, unless there is a pressing reason to save every single version of them.  When you add a file to a project, SLM scans its contents to determine whether it is  binary  in nature and automatically assigns it a type.  Using the -t flag, however, you can override the default assignment. This flag is most often used to designate non-text files as binary, and hence recoverable. It can also be used to force non-text files to be treated like text files. For example, if your program source file contains some graphics characters, SLM will identify it as a non-text file, but you can force it to be added as a text file using the -tt flag. Warning Forcing non-text files to be treated as text files can cause serious problems later! It is best to use this feature only if the file was actually created using a text editor. When you try to add such a file as a text type, SLM will warn you:   [file] appears to be an unrecoverable file; add as an unrecoverable file ?  SLM forces it to be treated as a text file only if you answer  Examples addfile -vtb *.* Adds to the project all files in the current enlisted subdirectory. Files containing non-text characters will be added as binary files (meaning that change history will be maintained for them), but if a file contains text characters only, addfile will inquire whether to add it as a text file. addfile -vr -tu -s \\server\share -p aproj\objdir objdir Adds the local subdirectory, c:\objdir (which is not enlisted in the project), together with its contents, as the  objdir  subdirectory of the  aproj  project. All files will be added as unrecoverable. addfile -tv version.h Creates and adds to the project a version file, where the current project version number will be kept up to date. The specified file (here, version.h) should not already exist.  addfile -vr -c "Create help  helpdir Adds the helpdir subdirectory and its contents to the project with the same comment,  Create help  for every file. Text files will be added as text files, and all other files will be added as unrecoverable. See Also delfile, sadmin settype addproj Creates a new SLM project Syntax addproj [-&fhv!] [-s SLM-root] [-p] project Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the new project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). The SLM root directory must contain the three system subdirectories, SRC, DIFF, and ETC. You should check that the server has enough free disk space to support your new project, and make sure that your users have all necessary privileges on this \\server\share. -p project Specifies the project's name. SLM will use this project name as a subdirectory name, so it should conform to MS-DOS naming conventions. If you supply a project name longer than eight characters, SLM will only use the first eight characters. If you supply a name with an extension and the extension is longer than three characters, SLM will likewise use only the first three characters of the extension. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Use addproj to create a new SLM project.  In each of the three SLM root master directories, addproj creates a subdirectory having the name of your project. It also creates the project status and log files in the \ETC master directory. To create a new project, do the following: Find a network server with adequate capacity to receive your new project. If the network server is set up with user-level security, make sure that your project team will have all the permissions needed to run SLM (these are RWCDA: Read, Write, Create, Delete, and change Attributes). Your team members should have these permissions throughout all three SLM trees (\ETC, \DIFF, and \SRC). If the SLM master directories do not yet exist in your share, create them. Enter the addproj command from a directory on your local machine, specifying the SLM root directory and the project name. Examples net use x: \\server1\share2 Connect to the server Switch to the server md src Create the SRC directory md etc Create the ETC directory md diff Create the DIFF directory Return to C: addproj -vs \\server1\share2 -p aproj The example above illustrates a simple case of setting up an SLM project named  aproj  on a network server named  server1  in a share named  share2.   Setting up network permissions and passwords would add further steps. If the new project uses existing SLM master directories, there is no need to create them. See Also delproj catsrc Retrieves previous versions of files. Syntax catsrc [-&fhv!x] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]    [-d directory] [-t when] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)|file@when(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Retrieves the specified file(s) or directory as it existed at a time specified by -t, and copies it into the output directory. Always use -d with -x (to specify an output directory).  When you use    -x, you should not use file@when arguments or patterns. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; retrieves files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only retrieves files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; retrieves files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only retrieves files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -d directory Directory into which output files are written.  The directory can be an absolute path name, or it can be relative to the current directory.  If it doesn t already exist, SLM will create it. -t when Time of version to retrieve (can be a date in m-d-yy format, a version in #.#.# format, or a version name in @name format). file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s)|file(s)@when File(s) to retrieve. If you do not use the -x flag, you can specify when in the past each file should be retrieved from by including a date, version number, or version name after an @ sign following the file name. For more information about specifying times and version numbers, see page 15. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Catsrc retrieves previous versions of text and binary files, but not of unrecoverable files (unless a specific version of an unrecoverable file was saved using in -k).  You can specify which version to recreate by using the -t when flag, or by using the @ modifier after each file  name (see the examples below).  The -t option applies to all file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s) arguments that lack an @ modifier.  See also out -t. The retrieved files are written to the screen (on stdout) unless you specify an output directory using the -d flag. The -x flag, used with the -t and -d flags, tells catsrc to scan the log to determine what files existed at the specified time (and under what names). Catsrc will then retrieve the files as they were at that time. Without -x, files that have since been renamed will be retrieved both under their new and their old names. Thus, -x is helpful for recovering an entire directory or directory tree as of one point in time. If the -r (recursive) or -a (all) flags are used, catsrc will create subdirectories in the target directory as required. Without -r, directory arguments are ignored. Examples Any of the following catsrc commands would retrieve the file code.c, version 7, as checked in on 6/15/92, project version name  alpha3,  project version number 1.30.17, and would display the file on the screen (on stdout): catsrc -vt 6-15-92 code.c catsrc -vt 1.30.17 code.c catsrc -vt @alpha3 code.c catsrc -v code.c@v7 catsrc -v code.c@6-15-92 catsrc -v code.c@1.30.17 catsrc -v code.c@alpha3 catsrc -v code.c@v-1 This example would retrieve the previous version of code.c and send it to the screen (on stdout). catsrc -vxrs \\server\share -p acct -t 1-1-92 -d yr91 db This example, executed from an unenlisted directory, would retrieve all files located in and below the db subdirectory of the acct project as of January 1, 1992, and write them to a subdirectory of the current directory named yr91. defect Un-enlists a user from a project (for good). Syntax defect [-&fhv!k] [-s SLM-root] [[-p] project] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Keeps the local copies of the project files (otherwise, they are deleted). In any case, defect always leaves the directories and subdirectories themselves. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Use defect to  unenlist  yourself from a project. This is a command to use only once, at the end of the project. The command removes your name from the project on the central SLM server, and dissociates your local directories from the project.  Unless you use the -k (keep) flag, SLM deletes your local copies of project files.  It always leaves your local directory structure intact. Examples defect -v This example, issued from the local project directory, unenlists the person from the project and deletes all local copies of the project files. defect -vk This example is the same as the one above, except that it leaves all local copies of the project files intact. defect -vs \\server\share -p aproj This example is the same as the first one, except that it explicitly specifies what project to defect from. If executed from the root of a former enlistment of which some subdirectories were still enlisted, it would complete the defection of the remaining subdirectories. See Also enlist, sadmin deled delfile Removes files from an SLM project. Syntax delfile [-&fhv!k] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-r [pattern]]  [-c "comment"] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using ">") Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Keeps your local copies of the project files (otherwise, they are deleted). Other people s local copies will still be deleted next time they ssync. Recursive; removes all files in a directory specified in the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, and all subdirectories below it including all files in them.  If no directory is specified, removes the entire contents of the current directory, including subdirectories.  If a pattern such as *.txt is specified, removes all files matching the pattern. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -c "comment" Specify the reason for deleting the files. The -c flag lets you supply the same comment for all files (otherwise, you are prompted to comment on each file individually). file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to delete from the project. If a directory alone is specified, it will be deleted only if it is empty, unless the -r flag is included. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Use delfile to remove a specified file or files from a project. Use caution, as everyone in the project will lose their local copies of files that have been removed from the project as they synchronize. This command removes specified files from the master source directory of a project, and also (unless the -k flag was used) deletes the local copy of the files from the enlistment where the command was issued.  It does not remove file history, so any version of a deleted file can still be retrieved using catsrc (assuming that the deleted file was recoverable, or that an earlier version of it was saved). When delfile has removed a file from the project, ssync will thereafter delete any local copy of the file that it finds when synchronizing any enlistment in the project. In other words, removing the file from the project will cause everyone s local copies of it to be deleted (the only exception being a single local copy saved in the enlistment from which delfile was run, if the -k flag was used). Use delfile -r directory to remove a whole directory and all its contents from the project.  Without the -r flag, delfile will not remove the directory unless it is empty. In any case, the directory will not be deleted on your local machine, although you can use the MS-DOS rd command to remove it. Examples delfile -vc  Too slow  subdir\old*.c This example removes from the subdir directory of the project all files matching  old*.c  and for each of them logs the comment  Too slow.   It also deletes the local copies of them from c:\projdir\subdir. delfile -vk dupfile.doc This example removes dupfile.doc from the project, but does not delete the local copy of the file, because of the -k flag. Moreover, ssync will not remove this particular local copy during later synchronizations. delfile -vkr asubdir This example removes the entire asubdir subdirectory from the project, including all files and subdirectories that it contains, but, because of the -k flag, does not delete local files. delfile -vr asubdir rd asubdir This example removes the asubdir directory and all its subdirectories from the project, including local copies of all project files, and then attempts to remove the local asubdir directory using the MS-DOS rd command (assuming that asubdir contained only project files and is now empty). See Also addfile, sadmin deldiff, sadmin exfile, sadmin tidy delproj Deletes an entire SLM project. Syntax delproj [-&fhv!] [-s SLM-root] [-p] project Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project Specifies the name of the project to be deleted. For this command, the -p flag is optional For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description The delproj command deletes a project s master source files from the SLM server and removes the project from the server. This command should only be used by the project administrator, after the project has ended. The command will fail unless all project members have already defected from the project. Before using delproj, ensure that all project files have been backed up and archived to your satisfaction, and ensure that all team members have defected.  Examples delproj -vs \\server\share -p aproj This example removes the aproj project from the specified server and share. See Also addproj, delfile, defect, sadmin deled enlist Join an existing SLM project. Syntax enlist [-&fhv!g] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Ghost: SLM enrolls you in the project and creates any project subdirectories on your local hard drive, but does not copy the project files.  Use this option to conserve disk space on your computer.  -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Use the enlist command to gain access to a project and  join the team.  Enlisting establishes ties between an enlisted directory on your local hard drive and the SLM project on the network.  When you enlist, all subdirectories of the project are created in your local enlisted directory, and unless you ghost enlist, all files in the project are also copied to your local hard drive.  When enlisting in a large or busy project, it is usually a good idea to use the -g flag and  ghost  enlist in the project. Ghosted files are treated just like ordinary checked-in files, except they don't appear in your local copy of the project.  You can retrieve your local copy of ghosted files using ssync -u (unghost) or by checking them out.  On a busy project, it is a good idea to ghost enlist even if you want the whole project copied down to your local drive. The reason is that enlist locks the whole project as it works, whereas ssync will only lock one enlistment at a time as it unghosts your files. In other words, the fastest enlistment method for a busy project will be a sequence like the following one: enlist -vgs \\server\share -p projname ssync -vur If the enlist command is interrupted in mid-operation for any reason, you can run enlist again (from your main project directory) at any time. SLM will warn you each time it encounters a directory in which you are already enlisted, but will enlist you in ones where you are not yet enlisted. The enlist command creates a hidden file named slm.ini in each enlisted directory to record local project information. Examples md projdir cd projdir enlist -vs \\server\share -p aproj This example creates a new directory on the local C: drive to receive the aproj project, changes to that directory, and then enlists in the aproj project from this directory. All files in the project will be copied into the new projdir directory, so make sure that you have enough disk space on the C: drive before enlisting. enlist -vs \\server\share -p aproj\c\doc This example enlists only into the c\doc subdirectory of the aproj project. If your local disk space is limited and you will only be working on one part of a project, this can be a good solution. enlist -vgs \\server\share -p aproj This example uses the -g flag to ghost in the aproj project. This saves the most disk space on the C: drive, because no project files are copied down. See Also defect, ssync -u, sadmin deled, addproj Checks a file back in when you're finished with it. Syntax in [-&fhv!bikouz] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [-c "comment"] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a brief command usage summary. Verbose; tells you what's happening (messages are displayed by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Ignore blank changes, i.e. changes in white space or tabs, when generating change history.  ('-b' has the same meaning as in 'slmdiff -b'). Ignore; discard the new version, and revert to the version that was checked out (the local version is changed to match the master version on the server). Keep or checkpoint; saves in its entirety the previous version of the file being checked in (this is normal for binary files).  For text files, in -k increases the speed with which catsrc can retrieve that version or an earlier one.  For unrecoverable files, a version is saved that actually can be recovered by catsrc or out. Note that history can be maintained for unrecoverable files. This is particularly useful for word processing (*.doc) files that change too frequently to be maintained as binary files, but of which a periodic  snapshot  is very useful. Check in all files which are checked out to this directory.  This option may not be specified with pattern or file(s) arguments. Update the SLM master versions of the specified file(s) on the server, but leave the file(s) checked out. Using this flag is identical to issuing the command, in file(s) and then issuing the command, out file(s). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; checks in files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only checks in files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; checks in files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only checks in files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -c "comment" Records a comment explaining changes to the file(s). Use -c to add the same comment to a number of files (otherwise, you will be prompted for a comment for each file individually). For text files, in passes this flag to slmdiff, telling slmdiff to treat CTRL+Z (Hex 1A) as a normal character rather than as an end-of-file marker. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to check in. If a directory alone is specified, its contents will be checked in (including the contents of all subdirectories under it) only if the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description The in command checks the specified files back into the SLM system. It replaces the previous SLM master version of the file with your new one, and increases the file version number by one. It records that you are finished changing the file, and places a read-only restriction on your local copy. If the file is a text file, the in command compares the new version to the prior one and records your changes in a difference (diff) file. If the file is a binary file, in saves the whole prior version. Note that if an unrecoverable file is checked in with the -k flag, that version of the file can be recovered later using catsrc or out. Examples in -voc "Fixed b37" This example checks in all files in the directory that are currently checked out, using the comment  Fixed b37.  It does not check in any files in subdirectories of the project. in -vor -c  minorfix  rtfdir This example checks in all files that are currently checked out in c:\projdir\rtfdir and in all subdirectories of that directory, with the comment  minorfix. in -vi afile.c This example checks in afile.c, but discards all changes that have been made to it since it was checked out. in -vour -c  in progress This example updates the master source versions of all files that are currently checked out in the project and all its subdirectories, with the comment  in progress,  but leaves the files checked out. As a result, other team members can have access to the changes that have been made so far. in -vkc "beta version" cmdref.doc This example checks in cmdref.doc (which happens to be an unrecoverable MS Word document) with the comment  beta version  and saves this version so that it can later be recovered.

Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). All; retrieves log entries relating to all files in all subdirectories enlisted in the project. Note that for the log command, the -a flag does not accept a pattern, such as *.txt, as an argument. Recursive; retrieves log entries relating to a directory specified in the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, and its entire contents, including all subdirectories below it and all their contents.  If no directory is specified, retrieves log entries relating to the entire contents of the current directory, including subdirectories. Note that for the log command, the -r flag does not accept a pattern, such as *.txt, as an argument. In filter; only displays log events created by in, addfile, delfile, sadmin release, and sadmin rename operations. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -# [#] Specifies how many log entries to display, counting back from the present (i.e. log -3 displays the three most recent events). Two numbers specify a range (log -14 10 shows the five entries starting at the fourteenth most recent and ending at the tenth).  -t when [when] Specifies a time range within which to list log entries. If only one time is included, the second is assumed to be the present, otherwise, the first time is the start time and the second is the end time. Use only if numbers (such as -5) are not specified.  -u user Specifies only those events pertaining to this particular user. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to list log entries for.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description The log command displays a list of the SLM events that have occurred in a project.  By default, the last 10 logged events are displayed, but you can also specify a different number of events to be listed, or a time period of interest, or a range of log entries to display. You can also request to see only those events affecting a specific file or files, or a subdirectory, or a specific user. The log normally includes the time of the event (to the minute), the user, the operation performed, the file affected, and a comment field. With the -v flag, seconds and day or the week are added to the time, and the file path and file version number are included. Examples -log -5 -i This example displays the last five changes made to files using the in, addfile, delfile, sadmin release and sadmin rename commands. log -18 16 This example displays three logged changes: the 18th most recent, the 17th most recent, and the 16th most recent. log -t .-7 This example displays changes made during the past week (from seven days before today up through the present). log -t 1.50 1.60 This example displays changes made to the project between versions 1.50 and 1.60.

CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Backdoor recovery. If the network is down, you might need to edit a local copy of a project file, making the file read-write using chmod or a similar utility. As soon as the network comes back up, you should check the file out using -b. Be careful! As long as the file in question is a text file, you will be all right even if someone else has made changes to it since you last synchronized your copy, because SLM will put you into a merge state. With a binary or unrecoverable file, however, if anyone else has the file checked out, or if your local version was not up to date with the one on the server, use ^C to cancel the out command. Save your changes with a new name, check the file out normally when you can, and copy over your changes one by one into the up-to-date file. Retrieves a new copy of the file as it exists on the server, discarding any local changes. Force non-concurrent use; ensures a warning if a file is checked out by more than one user. Using -n causes the entire directory to be locked while your files are being checked out, preventing others from checking files out or ssyncing until your operation has been completed. This eliminates the small chance that two people could check out the same file at the same instant. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; checks out files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the  p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the  p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only checks out files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; checks out files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)| file(s)@when] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only checks out files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. Without -r, directory arguments are ignored. -t when Specifies time of old version to retrieve: a date as m-d-yy, a version as #.#.#,or a version name as @name. file(s)|directory| pattern|file@when(s) File(s) to check out. You can include version times or numbers after a file name using the   modifier. For more information about specifying times and version numbers, see page 15. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description The out command checks files out of the SLM library so you can make changes to it. You can retrieve an old version of a file or files by using the -t flag or an @time specification at the end of a filename.  Generally, use catsrc to retrieve the whole project as it was at some time in the past. With individual files, use catsrc if you merely want to examine an older version, and out if you want to incorporate it back into the project. Use the -c flag if you make a mistake in an editing session and decide to start over with the version you first checked out.  If you just want to discard your changes and leave the file as it was when you checked it out, use in -i. Because of the way SLM works, many users can check out or synchronize their files at the same time. There is a small chance that two people could check out the same file at the same time, and not be notified. To be absolutely sure that this never happens, you can use the -n flag. In the case of text files only, you can edit a local file even if the network is down.  Make the file read-write using chmod or a similar utility. Edit the file as usual. As soon as the network comes back up, check the file out with the -b flag. You may now be in a merge situation, so when you check the file back in again, you may need to merge your changes with those of others. Examples out -vr *.doc Checks out all files with a .DOC extension located in the directory and in all subdirectories under it. out -vc afile.c If you had already checked out afile.c, had made some changes to it, and then decided that you wanted to revert to the earlier version up on the server, this command would copy the server version over the one that you had been changing. out -v afile.txt@1-1-92 Checks out afile.txt as it was on January 1, 1992. When you check it back in, unless you use in -i , you will have to merge it with the current version. scomp Compares different versions of a file or files and lists the differences. Syntax scomp [-&fhv!bdmz] [-s SLM-root] [-# [#]] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [-t when[when]] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Blank: ignore changes in white space and tabs (runs slmdiff -b). Diff between the current master file and the local file ( how does my version compare with the newest one? Diff between base file and current master file ( what have others done to the file while it's been checked out? For text files, scomp passes this flag to slmdiff, telling slmdiff to treat CTRL+Z (Hex 1A) as a normal character rather than as an end-of-file marker. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; compares versions of files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only compares versions of files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; compares versions of files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)| directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only compares versions of files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -# [#] Specifies how many versions to list differences for, counting back from the present moment (-3 displays differences caused by the three most recent events). Two numbers specify a range (-14 10 shows the differences caused by 5 events starting at the 14th most recent and ending at the tenth). If files are specified, the ranges apply to each file. -t when       [when] List differences reflecting changes to the files between the time of the first version specified and the time of the second (if only one is supplied, the second is assumed to be the present). file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to compare versions for. If a directory alone is specified, its contents will be processed (including the contents of all subdirectories under it) only if the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Scomp lists differences between specified versions of text type files.  It can be run whether or not the specified files are checked out, but by default, scomp lists the changes made to checked out files. Differences between current local source files and current master source files are cached in a subdirectory (slm.dif, hidden).  In also checks this cache, so that if scomp has been run since changes were last made, in files will not have to compute the differences a second time. This cache is not created when scomp -b is used, and is cleared when the file is checked in. Examples scomp Displays all changes made to all currently checked out files. scomp -t 1.50.01 1.50.02 makefile Displays changes made to makefile between the release of version 1.50.01 and version 1.50.02. scomp -3 fmaint.c txtrtns.c Prints the last three diff files generated for both fmaint.c and txtrtns.c. slmck Checks the integrity of the SLM system. Syntax slmck [-&fhvargilnou] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]]  [-c "comment"]  Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; checks SLM integrity starting in the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and in all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it. Will not match a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; checks SLM integrity in a target directory, and in all subdirectories beneath it. The target directory can be specified as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Will not match a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. Check the global (master) project state (for a project administrator s use only). Check the SLM initialization file (slm.ini). Check the log file (but don't necessarily fix it). New; upgrade the project to a new SLM format. Override the status file lock. Check the user's directory (default). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -c "comment" Logs a comment regarding the use of slmck.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Slmck checks either the local copy of the project (the default), or the master project directories (including the status file).  If it finds any problems, it prompts for permission to correct them. Slmck -u (fix local copy) is typically run by an SLM user to fix his or her local copy of a project, whereas slmck -g is run by the project administrator to fix the master version of the project. Slmck can also be used by the project administrator to upgrade the project to a new version of SLM. Examples The following is an example of what to do if you change your network name or the label of your local drive: slmck -irs \\server\share -p project Before running this command, however, you need to change the attributes of the slm.ini file in this directory from hidden/read-only to normal, and then delete it. Running slmck then recursively repairs slm.ini files in this directory and its subdirectories. slmck -urs \\server\shortname -p project Checks that your local copy of the project is correct.  It checks your slm.ini that you are correctly enlisted that your files are in the right state (checked in or out, correctly linked, etc). ssync Updates your local files to the latest versions. Syntax ssync [-&fhv!giku] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Ghost  the selected files and remove your copies from your local directory. Dangerous! This flag can destroy other people s work! Ignores pending merges for anyone who has checked out the file after you. When the files ssynced using -i are checked in, they will become the current versions. Other users  changes made since these files were checked out will be discarded.   If synchronizing to deleted files, keep the local copies. Unghost  the selected files: copy them to the local directory. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; synchronizes files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the  p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the  p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only synchronizes files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; synchronizes files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)| directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only synchronizes files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. Without -r, directory arguments will be ignored. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to synchronize. If a directory alone is specified, its contents will be synchronized (including the contents of all subdirectories under it) only if the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Ssync brings files in your local directory up to date with corresponding files in the project's source pool on the network server.  By default, ssync synchronizes all files in your current directory. Ssync -g marks the specified files ghosted and removes them from your local directory. Subsequent ssyncs will not copy them back.  Ssync -u unghosts files ghosted by enlist -g or ssync -g. Ssync will copy, add, delete, or merge files, or add or delete directories, as necessary, but will ask for permission to merge files. Since ssync copies the out-of-synchronization master files to temporary files before installing them, it might run out of disk space unexpectedly.  If this happens, ssync will prompt to abort the operation or continue.  If you continue, ssync will try to copy the remaining files using a different strategy, which won't be able to undo all of the work if aborted.  Your files won't be damaged, but you might be left with a directory containing some files which are still out of synchronization.  If this happens, try to free up some disk space and run ssync again. Examples ssync -va Brings all of your copy of the project entirely into synchronization. ssync -vgr bigdir Ghosts the contents of bigdir.  The directory structure will remain, but the files will be marked  ghosted  and will be removed from your local copy of the project. status Finds out the current status of files in the project. Syntax status [-&fhv!beglox] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [-u user] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr), including more detailed status information. Overrides project-level locking features (as provided by the  cookie  wrapper program in previous versions). Backdoor (or broken): provides status information about files that should be marked read-only but aren t. These are files that are not checked out, but which may be being edited in anticipation of using out -b on them later. Do not use -b with -x. Provide status information for all enlisted directories in the project, not just for the current directory. Global status: which files are checked out, and to whom. List filenames with paths (and no other information; useful for shell scripts). Provide status both of files which are checked out and of files which are out of synchronization. Do not use -o with -x Provide status of all files, not just those that are checked out. Do not use with -o or -b. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; provides status for files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only provides status for files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; provides status for files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)| directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only provides status for files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -u user Provides status relating to the specified user. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to provide status for. If a directory alone is specified, status will be provided for its contents (including the contents of all subdirectories under it) only if the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Status reports the state of the specified files.  If no filespecs are given, status prints the state of: (default) All checked out files in the current directory. All files that are checked out or out of synchronization. All files in the current directory. Examples status *.c Displays status of all checked out .c files in the current directory. status -avx Displays verbose local status of all files in the project. status -x subdir\ Displays status of all files in the subdirectory subdir. sadmin  SLM administration Subcommands The SLM administrator's command, sadmin, provides access to a variety of administrative services through a set of secondary commands. These services and subcommands fall into several categories: Category Command Description File operations rename Renames a file without losing history settype Changes the classification/type of a file Status file operations deled Deletes a user s enlistment from the project Translates status file into human-readable form listed Reports enlistments for a given directory Locks a project directory (locks status file) lowercase Changes all user, path and file names to lower case robust Turns on and off additional status file integrity checking.

Syntax sadmin comment [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-# [#]]  [-t time [time]] [-c "comment"] [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin comment,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. Note that with sadmin comment,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -# [#] Specifies how many versions to change check-in comments for, counting back from the present (i.e. sadmin comment -3 changes comments for the three most recent versions). Two numbers specify a range (sadmin comment -14 10 changes comments for the five versions starting at the 14th most recent and ending at the 10th).  -t when [when] Specifies a time range within which to change check-in comments. If only one time is included, the second is assumed to be the present, otherwise, the first time is the start time and the second is the end time. Use only if numbers (such as -5) are not specified.  -c "comment" The new comment to put into the log in place of existing comments. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to change comments for. If a directory alone is specified, comments for its entire contents will be changed, provided that the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Changes a range of check-in comments in the log. You might use it to add or correct comments as your project matures. The range can be specified using times (-t) or log entry counts ( #).  By default, all check-in comments in the range are changed, but you can limit the effects to particular files  comments by specifying file arguments. With the -a or -r flags, this command also accepts file patterns (such as *.c). deldiff Truncates the diff archive for a specified file, leaving the most recent diff entry. Syntax sadmin deldiff [-&fhv] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] file(s)|pattern(s) Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files).

Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). -s SLM root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). file(s)|pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to delete diff archives for. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Sadmin deldiff truncates the diff archive for a specified file, leaving the most recent diff entry.  deled Deletes a user s enlistment from the project. Syntax sadmin deled [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] enlistment Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin deled,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified using the [directory(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. Note that with sadmin deled,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). enlistment Can be either the exact directory path printed by sadmin listed, the index of the enlisted directory (IED) printed by sadmin listed, or the owner of the directory to be deleted. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Deled removes one or more enlisted directories from the status file. Deled will prompt if a user who owns more than one directory is specified.   For recursive deled using the -r flag, specifying the owner of the directory path is highly recommended, rather than specifying the IED, because subdirectories may not conform to their parent directories. In a subdirectory, a particular IED might refer to a different enlisted directory. See Also sadmin listed, defect Translates an SLM status file into human-readable (text) format. Syntax sadmin dump [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [dump-file] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files).

Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it. If a file name is included for dump-file, dumps the status file for every directory it processes into a file named dump-file located in that directory. If no dump-file name is specified, displays the status files successively on screen by way of stdout. Note that with sadmin dump,  a cannot accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r.  Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified using the [directory(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a file name is included for dump-file, dumps the status file for every directory it processes into a file named dump-file located in that directory. If no dump-file name is specified, displays the status files successively on screen by way of stdout. Note that with sadmin deled,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). dump-file A filename, without path information, for a file into which to place a text version of the status file. If sadmin dump processes more than one directory, a file of this name is created in every directory processed. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Dump is used to print human (and sadmin undump) readable representations of the status files. It prints the status file header, information about each file, information about each enlisted directory, and the state of each file in each enlisted directory.  If dump-file is not specified, dump writes to stdout. When a dump-file name is specified with the -a or -r flag, sadmin dump creates a dump file of that name in every directory that it processes, and can overwrite existing files of that name. See Also sadmin undump, status -ex exfile Expunges (totally deletes) a file or files from the project. Syntax sadmin exfile [-&fhv] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] file(s)|pattern(s) Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files).

If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only lists files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; lists files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only lists files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -c "comment" Causes each line of output (each file listed) to be preceded by the text of this  comment,  which is particularly useful when creating a batch file. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The file(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, that you wish to list. If a directory alone is specified, its contents will only be listed if the -r flag is included. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Lssrc lists all specified source files together with the path information pointing to the master versions of the files. If -l is used, the path information is omitted. If -c "comment" is given, the output will be prefixed by comment; which is suitable for generating a batch script to operate on the specified source files. release Syntax Names/numbers a release version of the project. sadmin release [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-c "comment"]  [-n project-version-name] [[[+]#].[[+]#][.[[+]#]]] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files).

All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin release,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin release,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -c "comment" Provides a general comment for the release version. -n project-version-name Specifies a text-string name for the release, by which it can later be recalled using catsrc. [[#].[#].[#]] Specifies the project version number of the release. Each # component of '[[#].[#][.[#]]]' can be:  (a) omitted, in which case there will be no change to that component of the project version number;  (b) a number, in which case that component of the project version number will be set to that number; or  (c) a plus sign followed by a number (such as +3), in which case that component of the project version number will be increased by the number following the plus sign. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Release marks a milestone in the development process.  The directory is marked released and a release entry (including the current project version name and number) is written to the log.  Later, catsrc will be able to recover project files (in the state that they were released) by project version name or number. Examples Here are some examples of the #.#.# argument. The current project number is assumed here to be 1.02.03. All terms remain the same:  1.02.03 3.2.1 The project version number is set to:  3.02.01 The optional third component defaults to 0:  3.02) The third component is omitted, and so remains unchanged:  3.02.03 +1.+2.+3 The various components are incremented:  2.04.06 .+1.0 A revision number of 0 is not printed:  1.03 See Also sadmin setpv, and version-description arguments, page 15. rename Renames a file (not a directory) without losing change history. Syntax sadmin rename [-&fhv] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-c "comment"]  old-name new-name Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -c "comment" Logs a comment regarding the rename operation old-name The current name of the file being renamed (cannot contain wildcard characters or path information). new-name The name to be assigned to the file being renamed (cannot contain wildcard characters or path information). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Rename is used to rename a file (not a directory) while still maintaining its change history.  It is similar to copy file newName; delfile file; addfile newName, except that newName retains file's change history.  The current file version number of the new file is one greater than the version of the old file. robust Turns on and off additional checking of status files in the specified directory(s). Syntax sadmin robust [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] on|off Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin robust,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin robust,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). on|off  causes additional status-file checking to be turned on, and   causes it to be turned off. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Robust turns on or off additional checking of status file integrity in designated directories of the project (initially, by default, this additional checking is turned off). Examples sadmin robust -v on Turns on additional checking in the current directory. sadmin robust -va off Turns off additional checking in the entire enlistment. runscript Completes or cancels an interrupted operation. Syntax sadmin runscript [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin runscript,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin runscript,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description SLM keeps script files to do  atomic  changes to the project (two-phase commit). First, operations are done on temp files and logged in a script file; permanent changes are not made until the commit point, when the script is run with user interrupts deferred. Sometimes, as a result of network problems or local workstation lock-up, an SLM command may be interrupted in mid-execution. After this happens, the next time an SLM command is run in that directory, the following fatal-error message is displayed: a previous run of SLM was terminated while processing script files; run sadmin runscript for [project]. Running sadmin runscript will fix the problem by either canceling the commands in the script (if the user hadn't reach the commit point), or by rerunning the script to completion. One way or the other, the project is returned to a consistent state. SLM keeps three kinds of script files: Operations which affect the user's local files are kept in a local.scr file in their directory.  (The presence of this file will affect only that user's work; other users can still do work using their own local.scr files).   The ssync and out commands have special script files named number.scr in the etc\project\subdir directory.  The number is the index of a user's enlisted directory, as printed by sadmin listed.  Because ssync and out can be run by many users simultaneously, each gets his own unique script file.   The third and most common type of script file is the master script file, named all.scr in the etc\project\subdir directory.  This is used by commands such as in for operations that affect the master project files. setfv Sets file version numbers. Syntax sadmin setfv [-&fhv] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [-c "comment"] file-version-number  file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s) Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; sets the file version for files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only sets the file version for files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; sets the file version for files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)|directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only sets the file version for files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -c "comment" Records a comment explaining the file version number change. Use -c to add the same comment to a number of files (otherwise, you will be prompted for a comment for each file individually). file-version-number The new file version number to set (between 1 and 32,767). file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The filename(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, for which you want to set the version number. If a directory alone is specified, its contents will be processed (including the contents of all subdirectories under it) only if the -r flag is included.  For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Setfv changes a file's version number. Remember that a file version number is automatically incremented when the master file is changed, such as by in.  Setfv can be used to advance or retard this number. If you lower a file's version number, you will lose the ability to retrieve certain versions of the file by file version number.  For instance, if afile.c is currently version 10, and you run sadmin setfv 5 afile.c, you will be unable to retrieve afile.c@v7, although you can still retrieve it by date or perhaps by project version number or name.  Setfv warns you if this occurs. setpv Sets the project version number. Syntax sadmin setpv [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]]  [-c "comment"] [-n project-version-name] [[#].[#][.[#]]] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin setpv,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as an element of the directory(s) argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin setpv,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -c "comment" Records a comment explaining the project version number change. Use -c to add the same comment to a number of files (otherwise, you will be prompted for a comment for each file individually). -n project-version-name Specifies a text-string name for this project version number, by which the version can later be recalled using catsrc. [[#].[#].[#]] Specifies the project version number. Each # component of '[[#].[#][.[#]]]' can be (a) omitted, in which case there will be no change to that component of the project version number;  (b) a number, in which case that component of the project version number will be set to that number; or  (c) a plus sign followed by a number (such as +3), in which case that component of the project version number will be increased by the number following the plus sign. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Setpv sets the current project version number; it has no immediate effect on the log, but is used to change the current version number in anticipation of a subsequent release command.  For instance, if you know that the project is to be released as version 1.50, you might use setpv to set the current project version number to 1.50 before release. This causes user's version files to be updated the next time they run ssync. See sadmin release for examples of the #.#.# usage. settype Sets the type of a file (to one of: binary, text, unrecoverable, or version). Syntax sadmin settype [-&fhv] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [-a|r [pattern]]  [-c "comment"] -t b|t|u|v [file(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -a [pattern] All; sets the type for files from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  If a pattern such as *.asm is specified, only sets the type for files which match the pattern. Do not use -a and -r together. -r [pattern] Recursive; sets the type for files from one or more target directories, and from all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified as an element of the [file(s)| directory(s)|pattern(s)] argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be a target. If a pattern such as *.c is included, only sets the type for files which match the pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -c "comment" Records a comment explaining the project version number change. Use -c to add the same comment to a number of files (otherwise, you will be prompted for a comment for each file individually). -t b|t|u|v Specifies the new SLM "type" for the specified files: b = binary, t text, u = unrecoverable, and v = version file. For a description of these file types, see page 16. file(s)|directory(s)| pattern(s) The file(s), including wild cards and path information if necessary, of which you want to set the type. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Settype changes the current file type of the specified files.  (Recall that the initial file type is set when the file is added to the system using addfile).  If you change a text or binary file to unrecoverable, you will be unable to access its old change history, unless you change it back.  Of course, if you change a file from unrecoverable to text or binary, it doesn't acquire a history of its past changes. If you occasionally want to save the history of an unrecoverable file, you should use in -k, not settype -tb file; in file; settype -tu file. Tidies up status files. Syntax sadmin tidy [-&fhvarc] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] [directory(s)] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin tidy,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as an element of the directory(s) argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin tidy,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. Checks that the users enlisted in subdirectories are the same as the users enlisted in the parent directory, and lists any that are missing or extra. Used only with the -a or -r flags. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Tidy tidies up the project. It removes unreferenced base files, removes unused file slots, and sorts the enlisted directories in the status file. The -c (check) flag, which is only useful with the -a or -r flags, checks that the users enlisted in subdirectories are the same as the users enlisted in the parent directory, and prints any that are missing or extra. Since users can enlist in a particular subtree of the project, it is not necessarily wrong for a subdirectory to have more users enlisted than its parent directory. trunclog Removes log entries in the specified range. Syntax sadmin trunclog [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] -t when [when] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin trunclog,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as an element of the directory(s) argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin trunclog,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). -t when [when] Specifies a time range within which to truncate log entries. If only one time is included, the second is assumed to be the present, otherwise, the first time is the start time and the second is the end time.   For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Trunclog removes log entries in the specified range. unlock Unlocks a project, or removes an administration lock. Syntax sadmin unlock [-&fhvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it.  Note that with sadmin unlock,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as an element of the directory(s) argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. Note that with sadmin unlock,  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Unlock is used for two different purposes.  One is to unlock a project which has remained locked following an interrupted SLM command. You should try to contact the person who has the directory locked to make sure that he or she is not merely checking in many files or doing some other slow operation.  Only then should you run unlock. The other use of unlock is to remove the administration lock that you placed on the project directory when you ran sadmin lock. undump Loads a previously dumped file. Syntax sadmin undump [-&fvar] [-s SLM-root] [-p project[\subdir]] dump-file Flag or Argument Description Redirects stderr to stdout  (so that all messages can be redirected together, using  Force; provides a default answer to all SLM queries (designed to facilitate batch processing of many files). CAUTION:  Use this flag carefully! It cannot give a   response in every situation. Always use -v if you use -f. Help; displays a screen of command usage information. Verbose; tells you more information about what's happening (generally by way of stderr). All; processes from the highest (top, root) directory enlisted in the project and all subdirectories below it, or, if the -p flag is used, from the lowest subdirectory specified with the -p flag and all subdirectories beneath it. If the -a flag is used, SLM will look for a file having dump-file name in every directory to be processed. Note that with sadmin undump,  a does not accept a pattern. Do not use -a if you are using -r. Recursive; processes one or more target directories, and all subdirectories beneath them. A target directory can be specified  as an element of the directory(s) argument, or as a subdirectory element of a project specified with the -p flag, or, if no other directory is specified, the current directory is assumed to be the target. If the -r flag is used, SLM will look for a file having dump-file name in every directory to be processed. Note that with sadmin undump  r does not accept a pattern. Do not use -r if you are using -a. -s SLM-root Specifies the SLM root directory for the target project (in the form \\server\share[\subdir[\subdir...]]). -p project[\subdir] Specifies the target project's name, followed optionally by a subdirectory of the project (such as -p aproj\lib\doc). dump-file The file name of the text file created by sadmin dump, corrected to eliminate corruption, and now rebuilt into a status file. For more information about argument syntax, see pages 12 to 17 at the beginning of this chapter. Description Undump is used to load a previously sadmin dumped file that you have changed.  This is used by  SLM wizards  to make otherwise difficult modifications to status files broken beyond slmck's ability to repair.  Use at your own risk! PAGE   PAGE

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. VSSMerge Tool Title _PID_HLINKSVSSMerge Tool The Source Depot Development Team devtemplate.dot Chris Antos Microsoft Word 9.0 TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT  VSSMerge Tool Created by   AUTHOR  \* MERGEFORMAT  The Source Depot Development Team  CREATEDATE \@ "M/d/yyyy" \* MERGEFORMAT  9/18/2000 Purpose Source Depot does not yet have a native graphical merge tool.  In the meantime, many SD users have reported that they particularly liked the graphical merge tool from VSS.  Since the VSS merge tool is actually exposed as an Active/X control, it was an inexpensive matter to create a vssmerge.exe wrapper that invokes the VSS merge tool.  The vssmerge.exe wrapper can be set up for use with Source Depot (or can be used as a standalone tool). Warning:  This tool is a BETA; use at your own risk.  However, two months of dogfood usage has uncovered no issues other than those listed in the Important Notes section, below. Installation Copy the files from   HYPERLINK "\\\\ptt\\release\\sd\\vssmerge\\"  \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\  to a directory on your local machine. Run regsvr32.exe on your local copy of the diffmrg.ocx file. Run sd set SDMERGE=[your local copy of vssmerge.exe] Sample installation steps for installing the VSS graphical merge tool C:\>copy \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\* c:\mybin\ \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\DiffMrg.ocx \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\SSUS.DLL \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\VSSMerge.exe \\ptt\release\sd\vssmerge\VSSMerge Tool.doc         4 file(s) copied. C:\>regsvr32 c:\mybin\diffmrg.ocx C:\>sd set SDMERGE=c:\mybin\vssmerge.exe Registry updated. Usage You can invoke the VSS merge tool from inside the sd resolve prompt. Previously, when sd resolve detected a merge conflict and prompted for an action, you would press   or the <Enter> key to edit the file and manually resolve the conflict. Now, you can press   to invoke the external merge tool specified by the SDMERGE variable. Important Notes No merge tool can guarantee logical correctness of merges.  As with all source control systems, the user is expected to carefully review merges.  Try using windiff -LO after resolving. The merge tool is actually part of the VSS product.  The SD team has merely written a small command-line wrapper that launches the Active/X merge control.  Any issues or bugs with the graphical portion of the tool cannot be fixed. SD uses a slightly different and more careful diff algorithm than VSS.  As a result, SD and VSSMerge may suggest different merges, or may disagree about how many conflicts exist and where they are located.  This is normal, and does not indicate a bug.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Writing USB Class Drivers for Xbox TitleWriting USB Class Drivers for Xbox mitchd Normal Tracy Sharpe Microsoft Word 9.0Writing USB Class Drivers for Xbox Microsoft Confidential, Revision 1.0 Introduction: The Xbox peripheral ports (XPP) are proprietary ports based on USB and OpenHCI host controller standards.  Electrically it is USB, and the core USB protocol stack is USB 1.1 compliant with only the most modest changes.  However, at the class level the standard diverges widely from existing USB devices.  The Xbox Title Libraries (XTL) support a pluggable driver model for future expansion.  Like all components of XTL, the class drivers are simply static libraries linked into the title.  This document covers all the aspects of creating a static library to drive entirely new USB devices.  The main topics covered are: Creating class registration tables Organizing Code Entry Points, Initialization and Enumeration Open and Closing Devices\Endpoints Exposing APIs USB Request Blocks (URBs) Miscellaneous IUsbDevice methods. Isochronous devices Class Registration: The core USB stacks enumerates class drivers upon initialization (when the game calls XInitDevices).  The core USB driver (usbd.lib   currently part of xapilib.lib) has data in the segments, .XPP$ClassA and .XPP$ClassZ.  Each class driver places a pointer to its registration data in a segment named .XPP$Class<ClassName>.  The linker merges together all of these segments to form a table which the core USB driver can walk through. Macros are provided in usb.h to create all the necessary entries.  Here is a sample from an existing driver, the Xbox Input Devices (XID). //------------------------------------------------------------------ //  Declare XID types and class. //------------------------------------------------------------------ DECLARE_XPP_TYPE(XDEVICE_TYPE_GAMEPAD) DECLARE_XPP_TYPE(XDEVICE_TYPE_DEBUG_KEYBOARD) DECLARE_XPP_TYPE(XDEVICE_TYPE_IR_REMOTE) #ifndef XDEVICE_TYPE_DEBUG_KEYBOARD #define XDEVICE_TYPE_DEBUG_KEYBOARD (&XDEVICE_TYPE_DEBUG_KEYBOARD_TABLE) #endif USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_BEGIN(XID_) USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_ENTRY(XDEVICE_TYPE_GAMEPAD), USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_ENTRY(XDEVICE_TYPE_DEBUG_KEYBOARD), USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_ENTRY(XDEVICE_TYPE_IR_REMOTE) USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_END() USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION(XID_, USB_DEVICE_CLASS_HUMAN_INTERFACE, 0xFF, 0xFF) USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION_DUPLICATE(XID_, 1, XBOX_DEVICE_CLASS_INPUT_DEVICE, 0xFF, 0xFF) #pragma data_seg(".XPP$ClassXID") USB_CLASS_DECLARATION_POINTER(XID_) USB_CLASS_DECLARATION_POINTER_DUPLICATE(XID_, 1) #pragma data_seg(".XPP$Data") We will now walk through what all of these macros do: DECLARE_XPP_TYPE(Typename) DECLARE_XPP_TYPE declares a device type used by USB enumeration for tracking devices of a given type.  A single class driver can declare multiple types that it supports. Somewhere in a header file, a #define should appear creating the device type for use in XGetDevices and XGetDeviceChanges.  It has the form: #define Typename (&Typename_TABLE) USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_BEGIN(Class), USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_ENTRY(Typename), and USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_END() These macros are used to create a table of the supported devices.  The class specific type (as used in IUsbDevice::SetClassSpecificType) is the ordinal of the type into this table.  You can sandwich as many USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_ENTRY macros between USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_BEGIN and USB_DEVICE_TYPE_TABLE_END as you wish.  There should be a comma after all but the last one. USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION(Class, ClassID,  SubClassID, Protocol) Binds the Class to the ClassID, SubClassID, and Protocol.  This macro declares the class entry points, and builds the full table entry needed by the USB enumeration code to match a device with its corresponding driver.  The ClassID, SubClassID and Protocol correspond to bInterfaceClass, bInterfaceSubclass, and bInterfaceProtocol in the USB Interface Descriptor returned by the firmware of the device.  The value 0xFF is usually passed in for the SubClassID and Protocol to indicate that bInterfaceSubclass and bInterfaceProtocol can be ignored.  USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DUPLICATE(Class, Ordinal, ClassID,  SubClassID, Protocol) is a way to bind additional ClassID s to the same Class.  The Ordinal is simply 1, 2, 3 etc. for each alternate. USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION_POINTER(Class) Used to declare the pointer entry for the list of USB class drivers.  This must be included in a section called .XPP$Class*, where * is any thing between A and Z.  Usually this is the class name.  However if the class name begins with Z, it have a lead character so that it is between A and Z, alphabetically.  After this macro the section must be changed to something else.  In the example above, this is changed to .XPP$Data.  Notice that .XPP$Data is not alphabetically between .XPP$ClassA and .XPPClassZ.  Global data associated with peripheral drivers is usually grouped in this segment. USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION_POINTER_DUPLICATE(Class, Ordinal) is used to include the alternative class declarations. Code Organization Since the linker does not include data in the final executable that has no references, you do something to force the registration table to be linked in.  If the registration table is not linked in, then the entry point and every other part of your driver are also not linked in.  This best way to keep the linker from discarding the registration table is to locate the table in the same code module as one essential API that the title will always call in order to use that type of device (such as an open device API).  If the title calls that API, then all the data in that code module by default will be linked in the final executable, including the registration table.  The registration table references the USB entry points, so these will be linked in as well.  Then every other top level API will be linked or not based on whether the title uses them. Entry Points, Initialization and Enumeration From the registration table the USB driver knows the entry points of the class driver.  The class driver must implement three: ClassInit, ClassAddDevice, ClassRemoveDevice, where Class is the identical to that used in USB_CLASS_DRIVER_DECLARATION. EXTERNUSB VOID ClassInit(IUsbInit *UsbInit); The initialize entry point is called during the title s call to XInitDevices, but before the hardware is initialized.  During the call to ClassInit the class driver must register its resource requirements using the IUsbInit interface.  This is done here rather than statically since the class driver can take into account the parameters passed into XInitDevices. IUsbInit has three public methods for use by the class drivers:   ULONG GetMaxDeviceTypeCount(PXPP_DEVICE_TYPE XppDeviceType); VOID  RegisterResources(PUSB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS pResourceRequirements); BOOL  UseDefaultCount(); A class driver will usually call UseDefaultCount first to determine if XInitDevices was called with the default parameters (NULL, and 0).  If this returns TRUE, the class driver decides the maximum number of open devices it allows at once.  Otherwise, the class driver then calls GetMaxDeviceTypeCount for each device type to determine how many open devices to support. With this information, the class driver fills out a USB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS structure and passes the structure to the core driver with RegisterResources.  The class driver can call this for each device type that it supports.  However, if each of the device types have exactly the same entries, except MaxDevices, it may choose to call it only once using the largest MaxDevices of any of the devices.  Here is the declaration of USB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS: typedef struct _USB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS     UCHAR ConnectorType;     UCHAR MaxDevices;     UCHAR MaxCompositeInterfaces;     UCHAR MaxControlEndpoints;     UCHAR MaxBulkEndpoints;     UCHAR MaxInterruptEndpoints;     UCHAR MaxControlTDperTransfer;     UCHAR MaxBulkTDperTransfer;     //Isoch     UCHAR MaxIsochEndpoints;     UCHAR MaxIsochMaxBuffers; } USB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS, *PUSB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS;  ConnectorType - describes the type of physical connector on the device.  This can be one of: USB_CONNECTOR_TYPE_DIRECT, USB_CONNECTOR_TYPE_HIGH_POWER, USB_CONNECTOR_TYPE_LOW_POWER. These values are connected to the physical topology of the bus.  At any given time four devices can connected directly to the Xbox, these may each have high power slot and one lower power slot.  Lower power devices may plug into either the low power slot or the high power slot.  High power devices may plug only into the high power slot.  This information is used to sum together all of the resource requirements before allocating the operating memory for the USB core driver. MaxDevices Sets the maximum number of devices of this type that may be opened at a given time.  This is a contract with the USB core driver that the class driver must enforce.  If the class driver fails to enforce, the USB core driver may fail to function properly. MaxCompositeInterfaces A given device may be part of a composite device (a device with multiple interfaces).  In most USB implementations, this is transparent to the class driver.  Because the USB core driver strictly controls memory usage, devices are restricted by specification from being part of random composites.  The class driver should either expect them to be part of a composite or not.  For example, Xbox audio always has a maximum of two interfaces as a composite device (a microphone and a headphone).  XID and MU do not expect to be part of a composite.  If you have multiple device types that appear together on a composite then only one of them needs to specify the total number, otherwise you will over allocate resources.  For this reason, a hypothetical device class which is always accompanied by a XID device as a composite could specify 2, and then XID could be part of a composite. MaxControlEndpoints - The maximum number of control endpoints used by a device at a time, excluding the default endpoint. MaxBulkEndpoints - The maximum number of bulk endpoints opened by the device at a time. MaxInterruptEndpoints - The maximum number of interrupt endpoints opened by the device at a time. MaxControlTDperTransfer - A TD is a transfer descriptor, which is an internal structure used to transmit a single packet.  The minimum value must be at least the maximum transfer size divided by the minimum supported wMaxPacketSize (from the endpoint descriptor) plus one.  If you attempt a transfer that is larger, then the request will fail.  Larger values can cause more transfers to get programmed at once (instead of queued), and the trade off is speed versus memory usage.  There is little performance gain for a value greater than two USB frames of data (a USB frame is about 1200 bits), after which memory is just being wasted.  The actual quota of control packets programmed is determined by the worst case of all the drivers.  The minimum value is always enough to fill two USB frames with 64 byte packets. MaxBulkTDperTransfer - This is the analog of MaxControlTDperTransfer but for bulk endpoints.  The quotas are kept separately to ensure that sufficient TD s are always available for each. MaxIsochEndpoints - Maximum number of Isochronous endpoints opened per device. MaxIsochMaxBuffers Maximum number of buffers that will be attached to each isochronous endpoint at a time.  This is different than TDs perf control and bulk as each isoch endpoint has its own pool for attached buffers.  So these are more expensive.  A pointer to this structure is passed into IUsbInit::RegisterResources.  The structure is processed and the pointer is not cached.  When the call returns, the class driver may reuse this memory, so the memory can be allocated from the stack.   Once this is done for each device type, the class driver returns from ClassInit. EXTERNUSB VOID ClassAddDevice(IUsbDevice *Device); This is called whenever a new device is detected with a bInterfaceId matching one supported by the driver.  It is important to note that only one driver can be registered for each device class at a time.  If more than one is linked in, only the first one (alphabetically) will be called on Add and Remove events. When a ClassAddDevice is called, the driver is in EnumerationTime.  At that time, the entire enumeration loop is blocked waiting for the enumeration of the current device to complete.  The loop will remain blocked until both the class driver returns from ClassAddDevice and  AddComplete is called on the IUsbDevice passed to ClassAddDevice.  Additionally, ClassAddDevice is called at DPC time and therefore may not block.  Additionally, any kernel services used must be callable at DPC time. The responsibilities of the class driver during enumeration time are: Determine if the device is supported and functioning. Determine the type of device and assign the ClassSpecificType (using IUsbDevice::SetClassSpecificType). Allocate memory (dynamically or from a free list allocated during initialization) necessary to track and operate the device.  This memory is often called a  device extension.   The class driver usually calls IUsbDevice::SetExtension to associate this memory with the interface.  This way it can find this memory via IUsbDevice::GetExtension, when ClassRemoveDevice is called. Cache the IUsbDevice interface for later use. Call AddComplete.  All USB enumeration is blocked until AddComplete is called. In order to accomplish these tasks, the class driver may open endpoints and may send any requests it likes to the device.  During enumeration time, the default endpoint is already opened.  The default endpoint will remain open until AddComplete is called.  After calling AddComplete, the class driver may reopen it if desired.  The class driver should never try to close the default endpoint before calling AddComplete.  Additionally, IUsbDevice has a number of methods that may only be called at enumeration time.  If these are called at others time they will ASSERT on a debug build or return faulty data on a retail build.  These methods are: const USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR8 *GetDeviceDescriptor() const; const USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR *GetConfigurationDescriptor() const; const USB_INTERFACE_DESCRIPTOR *GetInterfaceDescriptor() const; const USB_ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTOR *GetEndpointDescriptor(UCHAR EndpointType, BOOLEAN Direction, UCHAR Index) const; These functions return pointer to data structures that the USB enumeration loop has already collected, so it is very cheap to call them.  Notice that GetDeviceDescriptor returns only the first 8 bytes of the device descriptor.  If you need the full 18 byte descriptor, the class driver must send out another command over the default endpoint to the device.  GetConfigurationDescriptor will return a pointer to the full configuration descriptor.  You may walk this to learn everything about the configuration; however, GetInterfaceDescriptor and GetEndpointDescriptor, will provide information more relevant to the device.  GetInterfaceDescriptor returns the interface descriptor that the ClassAddDevice was called for (there may be multiple interfaces in the configuration, you wouldn t know which one is this instance).  GetEndpointDescriptor searches this instance s endpoints (those associated with the proper interface) to find the Index th endpoint of the specified type and direction. Like at other times, USB wire requests are asynchronous.   A completion routine is set and called when the request is complete.  If the class driver needs to send a request at enumeration time it should return from ClassAddDevice without calling AddComplete.  Its completion routine will be called back, still at enumeration time.  Multiple requests may be cascaded this way.  At some point the class driver must call AddComplete or all enumeration will halt.  While it is always a good idea to protect the class driver from hangs, it is especially important at enumeration time.  A hang can occur if the device NAK s a USB command forever (or much longer than desired).  The USB hardware will not give up on the transfer.  In later sections, the technique of setting a watchdog on USB requests is discussed further. When the device has learned what it needs to it calls VOID AddComplete(USBD_STATUS status).  USBD_STATUS_SUCCESS is set if the device is supported by the class driver.  USBD_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE is returned if the device is not supported.  In this case, the devices port is turned off and the associated resources are freed.   ClassRemoveDevice will not be called for this device.  If any other error is returned, then it is treated as USBD_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE, except that if the core USB driver determines that device is still physically attached, then the core USB driver will reset the device, and try to reenumerate.  The core USB driver will do this up to five times. EXTERNUSB VOID ClassRemoveDevice(IUsbDevice *Device); This is called when the class driver determines that a device has been removed from the bus.  There may be a delay of several tens of milliseconds between when a device is physically removed and when ClassRemoveDevice is called.  Therefore, it is possible that USB requests will start failing with various errors because a device is removed, but before ClassRemoveDevice is called.  Furthemore, the USB enumeration loop guarantees that ClassRemoveDevice will NOT be called during EnumerationTime for a device.  This feature simplifies the synchronization that class drivers must do.  It also means that class drivers should not retry failed requests many times at EnumerationTime. During ClassRemoveDevice the class driver must close any open endpoints.  Like ClassAddDevice, ClassRemoveDevice is called at DPC time and must not block.   Because closing endpoints is asynchronous, it must be done with cascading completion routines (a.k.a. a state machine) just as enumeration is done.  The class driver also invalidates any handles  it may have exposed for the device. Finally, the device must call IUsbDevice::RemoveComplete().  While not calling RemoveComplete will not hang the enumeration loop, doing so will hold on to resources potentially needed by other devices.  Failure to call RemoveComplete promptly, within a hundred or so milliseconds, may cause general enumeration problems.  After calling RemoveComplete, the IUsbDevice interface is no longer valid. Open and Closing Devices and Endpoints Most class drivers expose an interface that has semantics of opening and closing.  Usually when a device is opened, extra resources are allocated for operating the device and the endpoints of the device are opened.   When opening the endpoints, the class driver must enforce its contract obligations made when calling IUsbInit::RegisterResources.  If the driver opens more endpoints (MaxDevices times the sum of MaxControlEndpoints, MaxBulkEndpoints and MaxInterruptEndpoints), the USB driver may fail to function correctly.   Whether and how other operating memory of the device is allocated depends on the contract with the game.  For example, XID (the XInputXXX family of APIs) are guaranteed not to allocate memory after XinitDevices has been called.  The XID driver does this by looking at the number of devices requested in XInitDevices and allocating memory for that number with the memory treated as an array of handles and arranged into a free list of handles.  XInputOpen pulls a handle off of the free list and associates it with a device extension (allocated from another pool, enough for the maximum number that can be plugged in simultaneously).  The handle contains data fields that are only needed when the device is actively in use: endpoint handles, last known state, URB structures, etc. If the device is closed, then the endpoints are closed, canceling any outstanding I/O in the process, and the handle is returned to the free list. If the device is removed while the device is opened, the endpoints are closed, the handle is marked invalid, and the handle is detached from the device extension.  The IUsbDevice::RemoveComplete is called.  Subsequent use of the handle always returns ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED. The open and close semantics for a memory unit are more complicated.  When XMountMU is called, a NT style DEVICE_OBJECT is associated with a device extension and a filesystem is mounted on top of it.  XMountMU reverses the process.   Because ClassAddDevice and ClassRemoveDevice are both called at DPC level, the usual method of synchronization with the open and close is to raise IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL.  Synchronization is required so that an attempt is not made to open a device that has been removed, or to close the endpoints of a device (during close or remove) that are already in the process of being closed.  Since ClassRemoveDevice is a state machine and closing requires blocking (so it cannot be at raised IRQL the whole time), it is necessary to set a flag when closing or removing is in progress.  Here is the usual implementation.  Close has a close event to synchronize the closing process.  It raises IRQL and kicks off its close state machine and then lowers IRQL and waits on its close event.  The first step of the state machine sets a  close pending  flag.  Then it checks the  remove pending  flag.  If it is set, it just returns, without doing anything.  If remove is not pending, it sends its first command, which goes to the end of the state machine.  Before after setting the close event, it checks the  remove pending  flag again.  If it is set, it calls RemoveComplete.  In either case, it returns.  Now the original call to the close API will be unblocked and return to the caller.  The ClassRemoveDevice does something very similar.  It sets the remove pending flag and then checks for a close pending.  If a close is pending it just returns (as we saw, the close state machine will finish up a remove when it is done).  Otherwise, it runs to completion.  After calling RemoveComplete, it checks the close pending flag.  It may then need to jump into additional close steps and final to set the close event before returning. A class driver need not have open and close semantics for some types of devices.  These devices could automatically open their endpoints just after calling AddComplete and close them before calling RemoveComplete.  This would simplify much of the synchronization.  However, the class driver either has to allocate enough memory up front for all of the devices, or it dynamically allocate memory behind the back of the title. Exposing APIs Since Xbox titles all run in kernel mode, there is nothing special to exposing API s; they are simply library methods exposed by your driver.  You do not need to worry about ring transitions and IOCTLs .  How these API s get access to the appropriate device extensions is entirely up to you.  Note that when ClassAddDevice is called, you can use IUsbDevice to get the port number of the device, which is usually used to organize the device extension.  Once you can get back to the original IUsbDevice, the library method can then send any requests it likes to the device. USB Request Blocks (URBs) Communication with USB devices is done by submitting URBs.  URBs in the Xbox USB stack are quite a bit different than URBs in the WDM USB implementation.  Under WDM, URBs are an extra structure attached to an I/O Request Packet (IRP) to describe a USB request.  Under Xbox, there is no IRP.  All of the necessary functionality from IRPs have been rolled into the URB.  URBs are submitted with IUsbDevice::SubmitRequest. URBs come in two basics flavors, synchronous and asynchronous.  Synchronous URBs have been satisified by the time IUsbDevice::SubmitRequest returns.  Asynchronous URBs return from SubmitRequest, but the request is not satisfied until a completion routine is called.  This is discussed in more detail below.  Here is a complete list of URB function codes supported by Xbox, the functions in bold are asynchronous: URB_FUNCTION_CONTROL_TRANSFER URB_FUNCTION_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER URB_FUNCTION_OPEN_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_CLOSE_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_GET_ENDPOINT_STATE URB_FUNCTION_SET_ENDPOINT_STATE URB_FUNCTION_ABORT_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_GET_FRAME_NUMBER URB_FUNCTION_OPEN_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_CLOSE_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PORT URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_OPEN_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_CLOSE_ENDPOINT URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_ATTACH_BUFFER URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_START_TRANSFER URB_FUNCTION_ISOCH_STOP_TRANSFER The isoch functions are discussed further in the section on isochronous transfer and should be ignored for now. To send an URB, the caller must allocate a block anywhere in memory, global memory, the program stack, the kernel pool, or the user heap.  The only requirement is that the memory be allocated until processing complete (i.e. the completion routine has been called for asynchronous request, or the SubmitRequest has returned for synchronous requests).  Stack memory can be used even for asynchronous requests, if the caller can block execution (preventing the stack variable from leaving scope) until the completion routine is called. The allocated memory is filled out, either manually or using one of the URB_BUILD_XXX macros (recommended). An URB is a union of many similar structures: typedef union _URB     struct _URB_HEADER              Header;     URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER            ControlTransfer;     URB_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER  BulkOrInterruptTransfer;     URB_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER  CommonTransfer;     URB_OPEN_ENDPOINT               OpenEndpoint;     URB_CLOSE_ENDPOINT              CloseEndpoint;     URB_GET_SET_ENDPOINT_STATE      GetSetEndpointState;     URB_ABORT_ENDPOINT              AbortEndpoint;     URB_RESET_PORT                  ResetPort;     URB_GET_FRAME_NUMBER            GetFrame;     URB_ISOCH_ATTACH_BUFFER         IsochAttachBuffer;     URB_ISOCH_START_TRANSFER        IsochStartTransfer;     URB_ISOCH_STOP_TRANSFER         IsochStopTransfer;     URB_ISOCH_OPEN_ENDPOINT         IsochOpenEndpoint;     URB_ISOCH_CLOSE_ENDPOINT        IsochCloseEndpoint; } URB; Notice that each USB function has its own structure.  The memory block allocated only has to be large enough for the actual structure being sent.  The largest of these is URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER.  The URB_BUILD_XXX macros all take pointers to the specific URB type.   Here is the list of macros:  USB_BUILD_CONTROL_TRANSFER USB_BUILD_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER USB_BUILD_ISOCH_OPEN_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_ISOCH_CLOSE_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_ISOCH_START_TRANSFER USB_BUILD_ISOCH_STOP_TRANSFER USB_BUILD_ISOCH_ATTACH_BUFFER USB_BUILD_OPEN_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_CLOSE_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_OPEN_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_CLOSE_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_GET_ENDPOINT_STATE USB_BUILD_SET_ENDPOINT_STATE USB_BUILD_ABORT_ENDPOINT USB_BUILD_RESET_PORT USB_BUILD_GET_FRAME USB_BUILD_CLEAR_FEATURE USB_BUILD_SET_FEATURE USB_BUILD_GET_CONFIGURATION USB_BUILD_SET_CONFIGURATION USB_BUILD_GET_DESCRIPTOR USB_BUILD_SET_DESCRIPTOR USB_BUILD_GET_INTERFACE USB_BUILD_SET_INTERFACE USB_BUILD_GET_STATUS USB_BUILD_SYNC_FRAME  Look in usb.h to see the list of parameters that they each take.  Notice that there are more of these than URB structures or URB functions.  Many of these build standard requests which are nothing more than specialized forms of a control transfer. After the URB is filled out it is submitted with SubmitRequest.  The asynchronous URBs have a CompleteProc and a CompleteContext in their structures.  The CompleteProc is a caller-implemented routine that is called when the request is satisfied. typedef VOID (*PURB_COMPLETE_PROC)(PURB Urb, PVOID Context); The original URB and the context (also in the URB) are provided in the callback.  The status field in Urb.Header.Status contains the result of the operation.  The CompleteProc is always called at DISPATCH_LEVEL in the context of the DPC which processes USB interrupts.  Additional USB requests may be submitted from the CompleteProc and the same URB block may be reused for these. URBs can hang if the device hangs.  This happens when the device NAKs forever.  The USB hardware will never give up trying to access the device.  For this reason, class drivers should implement a watchdog on all USB requests.  This is usually done by calling KeSetTimer to set a timer associated with a DPC routine .  The request is then submitted.  When the request completes, then KeCancelTimer is called.  If the timer DPC gets executed, it calls IUsbDevice::CancelRequest.  CancelRequest is itself asynchronous and returns immediately probably before the URB has been cancelled. You pass to it a pointer to the URB that you are waiting for.  It starts the cancel process and forces the CompleteProc to be called within a millisecond or two.   In most cases, the URB will be cancelled, however you may occasionally find that the URB was in the process of being completed as CancelRequest was called, in these cases the URB will complete successfully.  Either way though, you will force completion of the request.  You may only cancel wire transfer URBs. Stalled Endpoints A USB transfer request may return USBD_STATUS_STALLED.  This indicates that the device has put a STALL on the bus.  The USB specification lists many reasons for setting STALL.  If the STALL is on a control endpoint, than it is self-resetting and the class driver does not need to take any action.  On bulk and interrupt endpoints, it is up to the endpoint to clear the stall.  There are two steps to this: send a CLEAR_FEATURE (it is a URB_FUNCTION_CONTROL_TRANSFER) to the device to clear the endpoint halt and send an URB_FUNCTION_SET_ENDPOINT_STATE to indicate that the halt is cleared and the data toggle is reset. Aborting Endpoints URB_FUNCTION_ABORT_ENDPOINT is a special request that cancels all URBs sent to an endpoint and is asynchronous.  When you submit it, it forces the completion of all URBs send to that endpoint.  When that is done, then the abort endpoint request is completed. URB_FUNCTION_CLOSE_ENDPOINT and URB_FUNCTION_CLOSE_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT implicitly do an URB_FUNCTION_ABORT_ENDPOINT before completing. Miscellaneous IUsbDevice methods. Here are a few IUsbDevice methods not discussed yet: BOOLEAN IsHardwareConnected() const Returns true if the core USB stack knows that the device is not connected.  This can be called if a transfer fails to determine if the device is attached.  It is usually better to just wait for ClassRemoveDevice to be called. UCHAR GetInterfaceNumber() const; Returns the interface number of the device.  This value is often needed to send control commands to the proper device interface. ULONG GetPort() const; Returns the port number of the device.  This corresponds to the bit position return in XGetDevices. void DeviceNotResponding(); Occasionally, a class driver will determine that a device is no longer functioning.  Perhaps it is hanging on commands or just behaving erradically.  After trying more gentle methods to recover the device, the class driver may call DeviceNotResponding.   This simulates a removal and reinsertion to the software.  You will get a ClassRemoveDevice followed by a ClassAddDevice for the device, and callers of XGetDevices or XGetDeviceChanges will see the device go away and come back.  The device will not lose power , but a USB port reset will be issued and the device will be reenumerated. static ULONG Win32FromUsbdStatus(USBD_STATUS UsbdStatus); static NTSTATUS NtStatusFromUsbdStatus(USBD_STATUS UsbdStatus); These are error code conversion routines to convert USB style error codes to Win32 and NT style error codes. Isochronous Support This section will be completed at a later time.  The existing class drivers use a global that has the structure statically filled out.  Then it modifies MaxDevices and calls RegisterResources for the first device type.  For additional device types, it modifies the necessary fields and resubmits the same memory block.  This will become more clear in the next section.  On a composite device, if one or more of the interfaces are supported, the port will not be turned off, but other unnecessary resources will be freed.  The concept of handle here is very much class dependent and dependent on the API exposed by the class driver.  This is very different then USB under WDM, where the endpoints are always opened and the class driver need not worry about them.  The resources come from a global pool, so one errant class driver may go undetected, unless the other class drivers are also pushing their maximum.  That is unless you want to hook into the FATX filesystem.  This filesystem is still NT based, and uses IRPs and IOCTLs.  That is beyond the scope of this document.  The Windows 2000 DDK explains this well, and it is identical on Xbox.  The delay is required as USB must pause the endpoint and wait a USB frame to be sure the hardware is honoring the pause.  Then it can go and retrieve the request and cancel it.  Xbox does not have the necessary hardware to switch power on the ports.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Silver xdk box TitleSilver xdk box davidx Normal.dot Microsoft Word 10.0Using XInput Remote 1. Make sure everything under ntos\dd\usb\netsim is sync d up and built. After the build, you should have: - client library: xdk\lib\xinputrm$(D).lib - win2k server executable: netsim\win2k\obj\i386\xbinput.exe - silver box server executable: xirmsrv.XBE 2. Rebuild your program to use the client library Add the following to your sources file and clean rebuild your test program: C_DEFINES=$(C_DEFINES) -D_XINPUT_REMOTE LINKLIBS=$(LINKLIBS) \     $(LIBRARY_PATH)\xinputrm$(D).lib \     $(LIBRARY_PATH)\xnet$(D).lib \     $(LIBRARY_PATH)\xbdm.lib 3. Running your test program using win2k as server  3.1 Plug the HammerHead controller into a USB port on your win2k machine. Go to Control Panel and make sure the controller is functioning correctly. 3.2 Run the win2k server executable under netsim\win2k directory xbinput [-x client-xboxname] 3.3. Now copy your test program to the client machine (e.g. DVT box) and run it. The controllers connected to the server machine will appear to your test program as if they were directly connected to the client machine. Note that you can reboot the client machine without restarting the server. The server will detect this condition and automatically reconnect with the client. 4. Running your test program using a silver XDK box as server 4.1 Copy xirmsrv.XBE to your server machine. Since there is no UI setup, you need to copy a config file to your server machine as well. The config file should be named xirmsrv.cfg. It s a text file with two lines: name=<your client xbox s name> ipaddr=<your client xbox s IP address> Either name or ipaddr field can be empty. But they cannot both be empty. Here is a sample config file: name=jont0 ipaddr=157.56.10.89  Copy both xirmsrv.xbe and xirmsrv.cfg to the xe:\ directory. 4.2 Start running xirmsrv.XBE on your server machine first. 4.3 Now start your test program on the client machine, as in 3.3. 1. Server box 1.1 init mode   after reboot if there is no saved config file or a special key combination is pressed, go into setup mode config file has the client IP address and an optional client name special key combination will be START+BACK+X else, read the client name and/or IP address from the config file and go into server mode for that particular client 1.2 setup mode wait for client-init broadcast packets from any client when a packet is received if both server and client have autonet address, then go directly to the server mode with the client name / IP address notice that existing config file is not updated else, display the client name/address and prompt the user whether to serve the client if confirmed, save the client name/address in the config file and go to the server mode if not, go back to the beginning of setup mode to wait for broadcasts 1.3 server mode if came from init mode, wait for bootup broadcast from the specified client we'll match name first if no name is specified, we'll then match IP address if address match, and the client-init has a name update the config file with new name save the client initial sequence number (CISN) send the server-init packet to the client  this contains the server initial sequence number (SISN) initial sequence numbers should be picked randomly loop forever: if a packet is received from the client if the packet is a bootup packet if the sequence number is the same as the CISN, discard packet otherwise, assume the client has just rebooted go back to the beginning of the server mode if the packet is an acknowledgement remove all acknowledged packets from the send queue if send queue isn t empty, set retransmission timeout retransmission timeout should be very short   0.5 seconds if retransmission timeout, resend the first packet in the send queue if exceeds the max number retries, assume the client is blocked stop retransmitting until the input state changes or a packet is received from the client max retry will be 3 if there is an input state change and the send window is not full queue up an appropriate packet in the send queue increase the send sequence number by 1 for each new packet if send queue was empty, set retransmission timeout 2. DVT box 2.1 bootup sequence - when XInitDevices is called allocate memory for maintaining input state information choose CISN randomly broadcast bootup packets and wait for server acceptance repeat at regular interval until connected to the server timeout interval is 1 second wait for a little while to receive the initial packets from the server 2.2 network traffic service routine if there is no data from the server, do nothing while there is data left read a packet from the server if the sequence number matches the next expected number process this packet and update the current input state if there is anything in the receive queue that s now in sequence process those packets as well update the next expected sequence number else if the sequence number doesn t match but is within the current receive window buffer the packet in the receive queue for later use  send an acknowledgement to the server with the next expected sequence number notice that the client could acknowledge multiple packets at once 2.3 XInput APIs We currently don t actively send anything from the client to the server. XInputSetState is stubbed out to do nothing. Other APIs just work on the data maintained in the current input state. Whenever an XInput API is called, we ll check to see if we have received any packets from the server. If we have, then we ll process those packets and send out appropriate acknowledgements. 3. Wire protocol ll use UDP for communicating between the server and the client. The server listens on port number 8873 for client-init packets. Once the server accepts a client, they communicate through a pair of randomly chosen temporary port numbers. Packets sent from the server to the client are acknowledged. But packets from the client to the server are not. The packet format is very simple: 32-bit packet type CLIENT_INIT client >> server SERVER_INIT client << server DEVICE_CHANGES client << server STATE_CHANGES client << server SET_STATE client >> server client >> server KEYSTROKE client << server 32-bit: send sequence number 32-bit:  acknowledged sequence number variable length data bytes CLIENT_INIT protocol version number nul-terminated client name ASCII string SERVER_INIT no data DEVICE_CHANGES 32-bit keyboard device mask (0 or 1) 32-bit active device masks 32-bit insertion masks 32-bit removal masks an XINPUT_CAPABILITIES structure for each active device starting from the lowest port number to the highest one STATE_CHANGES 32-bit device masks an XINPUT_STATE structure for each device with mask bit set SET_STATE 32-bit device port number XINPUT_FEEDBACK structure no data KEYSTROKE XINPUT_DEBUG_KEYSTROKE structure

; Security Gateway Configuration
;
; The format of this file is a series of key/value pairs, separated by one or more spaces.
; The key part is a string, the value part can either be a string or a list.  A list is
; simply a series of key/value pairs enclosed in braces.  The values in a list can contain
; more lists for arbitrary nesting.  A value may be enclosed in double-quotes (") if it 
; contains spaces which should be considered part of the value.  The expected type of a 
; value depends on which key it is a part of and its context.
;
; Finally, comments can be added on any line by prepending it with a semicolon.
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Client Configuration
;
; This section specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that can be supported,
; as well as the number of past clients that are remembered to defend against replaying
; valid key-exchange initiator packets repeatedly.

;
; This section specifies the Id and Name of each service that any of the servers

; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Servers
; 
; Each server in the datacenter is assigned an Id that the client uses as the destination
; port to address UDP or TCP packets.  This port is used to route the packet to the
; given server on the datacenter.  Note that each server must have a unique Ip/Port pair.
; That is, it is illegal for two server records to point to the same Ip/Port.  It is
; acceptable, however, to have two server records point to the same Ip on different Ports.

NV_ESCAPE_ID and NV_ESCAPE_ID_RETURN define a GDI ESCAPE to verify what driver
is currently running.  IHV's that receive display driver source code should
substitute their own private mechanism.  Note that it is a WHQL failure to have
IHV property pages and NVIDIA property pages active at the same time.
  
  
IHV's that do not receive display driver source code should define the
following in NVVER.H, and also make sure that the filenames for the control
panel binaries are the same as NVIDIA's (this prevents the two sets of pages
being active at the same time).

#define NV_ESCAPE_ID                'nv'
#define NV_ESCAPE_ID_RETURN         0x3031564E  // "NV10"

On 4/6/2001 I changed the headers in the DirectX directory to use precompiled headers
in a different way.  They had been set to "automatic" style (/YX option) wherein the
compiler decides where to stop looking for more material to add to a common header as
it proceeds through the compile list.  I believe this method caused too much "adjustment" 
on the part of the compiler resulting in poor compile performance.

The method used now requires that every file start with "nvprecomp.h" (See next section for 
exception).  The compiler will specifically look for #include "nvprecomp.h" in a file and
ignore EVERYTHING before that.  So programmer beware!  Never put anything before that. Using
this method, a new file (nvprecomp.cpp) triggers the generation of the precompiled header.
Then all files use that precompiled info during that build.  The performance increase is dramatic!

On my P4 700, the build of DirectX component for win2k went from 3 minutes to 30 seconds.

----------
Opting Out
----------
Since a header is compiled once if it's in the precompiled header then it cannot compile
differently for some files than for others.  The classic example here is using a #define to
cause one file to instantiate objects when including the header, while all other files don't 
instantiate the objects.  Such a header cannot be precompiled.

Two files presently opt-out of precompiled headers for this reason: nvStereo and ddDrv.  See
ddraw/common/MAKEFILE to see how opting out is done.

-----------------------------------
Maintaining the Precompiled Headers
-----------------------------------
Only add files that are large compile overhead and/or generally useful headers to nvprecomp.h.

If you have a file that you would like to add to the precompiled header please remove references
to that header from all other files in the ddraw hierarchy (because they will now get it from the pch).

Beware the file x86.h as it defines some strings that can cause much 'ordinary code' to not compile.

Michel Conrad Franck Diard OBJECTIVES 1) Support dynamic allocation and garbage collecting of unused and "pending free" textures. At this time, complex surfaces (CS) are used for VertexBuffers (VB) and textures. They are used through a simple template whose parameter is an integer value of 16 for VBs and 8 for textures. This gives a static size to arrays inside the CS without having a #define.  CComplexSurface<TOTAL_VB_RENAME> m_Surface; 2) Unify the surface allocation mechanism, either in VID, AGP, PCI or SYS memory. 3) Reduce the memory footprint of the driver: collect and regroup variable in small, flexible and efficient data structures This is the current memory footprint of the driver with 3DMark 2000.  EMBED Excel.Sheet.8   Although 3 megs of system memory is not "crazy" for 1300 textures, it means that the cache coherency is bad while we access these structures. A thinner footprint could give some better cache performance. 3) Support renaming for CubeMaps and Volume Textures. A texture is a linear chunk of memory containing some bitmap (rgb colors, indices, compressed data). This chunk of memory includes all the mipmap levels and the faces of a cube map, also containing mipmap levels. 4) Clean the object model a little bit. A texture should own its palette. If the palette has to be shared, we increment a reference counter inside the instance. 5) Support calling an "explicit" garbage collection function. 6) Document the data structures. LOCKS A hardware lock means that a surface is being used or is going to be used by the hardware. In any case we should not touch the texture/VB anymore, until the hardware has used it and is done with it. BLOCK MANAGER The block manager (BM) is instantiated only once as a global variable. The block manager owns all the blocks of memory used in textures, vertex buffers, sufaces. It has a pointer to the first of all the blocks it owns. CBlockManager CBlockDescriptor * m_allocCache; CBlockDescriptor * m_inUseList; Allocate(nvObject *owner, sizes, memtype); Free(CBlockList, data) Lock(CBlockList *, &data); UnLock(CBlockList *); GarbageCollect(); Each block descriptor has a forward pointer to the next block descriptor in the private list and in the global list. CBlockDescriptor // a clone of CSimpleSurface. int address, offset; CBlockList * m_owner; int m_size; int m_pitch; int memtype; ... // basically most of the CSimpleSurface CBlockDescriptor * next; CBlockDescriptor * previousRenamed;  CBlockDescriptor * nextRenamed;  The BM sees all blocks linked together as a simple forward linked list. The BM can walk though this list and get rid of some blocks if some memory is needed or upon an explicit call to the manager. Some blocks like the ZBuffer is not movable. Each block descriptor has a back pointer to the CBlockList structure that owns it, so the block manager can update stats and adjust counters for this list when the action is not initiated by the texture or the vertex buffer (ex: garbage collecting). The BM sees one list of blocks. Each CMipLevelSet or VB gives his CBlockList to the BM each time it asks for some services on it. The BM can update this private list. CBlockList A VertexBuffer or a MipLevelSet owns as a CBlockList structrue. This represents the list of all the blocks of memory involved in this vertex buffer at this time. This structure collects variables describing the list like the active block, the number of blocks, the number of "pending free" blocks in this list. The "pending free blocks" stay in the circular list. The CBlockList is a convenient data structure since it collects information about the private list (nb, stats). It is owned by a Texture or a VB and the BM can write in it, since it receives the address of this structure each time some services are asked for.  CBlockList CBlockDescriptor * m_Active; int m_nb; int m_max; int m_min; //stats about the use of this list.... should we shrink it ? RECYCLING This private list is a circular double linked list. Each time we need renaming, the BM is going to look the next block in the list. That item should be the oldest one (in this list). If the block is not in use by the hardware anymore, we return this one (we can adjust its size if needed).  If the list is full with hardware "being used" or "going to be used" blocks, the BM allocates a new one and links it in this list. If the number of "not used anymore" blocks is greater than a limit, we can move some blocks to the "free" (!!! not "pending free"!!!) list. This "free" list acts as a cache for allocations (these blocks don't belong to any list anymore). We can discard the blocks in the free list on a size or time basis (we don't keep a cached block larger than 300k, not more than 30 items, not older than n clock ticks...). Some blocks could be reused if the size we need is more than 80% of the block size. When an operation on a texture needs to lock some memory and the hardware is busy with the current block, the block manager should allocate a new block and give the address back to the calling routine. CMipLevelSet  The CMipLevelSet groups the information regarding the texture: it can be a regular 2D texture with mip levels, a volume texture with mip levels, a cube map with mip levels. It has a pointer to the data. The memory this points to may vary, as it can be changed by the block manager during a Lock call. CMipLevelSet void * m_data;  //pointer to the whole bitmap CBlockList m_blockList; int m_nbLevels;    //number of items in the array CMipLevel m_levels[];     // the array CTexture * m_owner; CreateAllocateVolume(sx, sy,sz, nMip, SOI, MemType); CreateAllocate2DTexture(sx, sy, nMip, SOI, MemType); CreateAllocateCubeMap(sx, sy, nMip, SOI, MemType); UpdateMipMapChain(); //Update bitmap Lock(); // BM->Lock(m_blockList, rename_policy); UnLock(); int DirtyLevels[]; It is important to notice that the CBlockList structure is actually part of the structure. The CMipLevelSet has a array of CMipLevel structures. A CMipLevel represents a 2D surface of memory. Each cell of this array contains a backpointer to the CMipLevelSet it belongs to, some storage for the width, height and pitch of this 2D surface. It also has an offset that is added to the data pointer of the CMipLevelSet to give the start address of the bitmap for this level.  CMipLevel CMipLevelSet * m_owner; int m_dataOffset; int m_height; int m_width; Lock(); // m_owner->Lock() VERTEXBUFFER The vertex buffer has a pointer on the data that is active at this time.  If a lock occurs, we call BM.Lock(m_blockList, &m_data) so the block manager can try to get a lock on the active block of memory. If the active block is not available renaming is triggered, a new block is allocated and the member pointer m_data is updated. CVertexBuffer void * m_data;  //pointer to the whole bitmap CBlockList m_blockList; UserLock(); // BM->Lock(m_blockList, &data, rename_policy); DeviceLock(); TEXTURE A texture is composed of two MipLevelSets. One is meant for linear/user purposes. The second is for swizzle/hardware purposes only. The user/linear MipLevelSet will own only one block. The swizzle/hardware MipLevelSet may contain an unlimited number of blocks. CTexture CMipLevelSet * m_user; CMipLevelSet * m_device; short m_palette; int m_format; DeviceLock(); UserLock(); UpDateDeviceBitmap(); UpDateUserBitmap(); SUMMING UP Each renaming list is circular list that grows on demand. The block manager can walk through all the blocks to force some garbage collecting. Each texture or VB sees only its private list. Not renaming lists contain only one block. The block manager does not know anything about textures or vertex buffers. Texture, vertex buffers and other 2D surface like ZBuffer don't know anything about the block manager.  EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8    EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8   Complex Surfaces Engine I, the original The current Complex Surface Engine is implemented in the complex surface class CComplexSurface along with the simple surface class CSimpleSurface. The fundamental operations for these classes (besides Create and Destroy) are Lock and Unlock. In the case of Lock/Unlock there are two varieties used to acquire and release exclusive access to underlying memory. Host access is controlled by the cpuLock/cpuUnlock method and hardware access by the hwLock/hwUnlock method. The complex surface extends the simple surface with support for Renaming, which is used to reduce blocking on cpu access to a buffer that hardware is still busy using. Under certain conditions a new or recycled buffer from a fixed pool (array) of buffers can be substituted for the busy buffer. Additionally, the complex surface makes it easy to maintain cpu (linear, application accessible) and hardware (swizzled, optimized) versions of textures and helps keep updates efficient by minimizing the copies between formats, only updating sublevels that need updating and so on. CSimpleSurface  The simple surface structure contains the details of the surface s location, format, statistics and a pointer to the wrapper object for the surface. The simple surface supports the concept of ownership, so that the simple surface can be used to describe a surface in memory that it did not allocate itself (eg mip sub levels). CSimpleSurface     DWORD      m_dwAddress;       // surface address [absolute]     DWORD      m_dwOffset;        // surface offset [depends on dma context]     DWORD      m_dwFormat;     DWORD      m_dwBPP;           // bytes per pixel  DWORD      m_dwBPPRequested;  // what did the app originally ask for?

Surfaces are allocated on demand, up to cMax allocations. Once all the surfaces in the array are allocated, renaming must circulate through the array to find surfaces that are allocated but no longer in use. If all surfaces are in use then the Lock will busy wait until the hardware has finished using the oldest surface in the array. There is no mechanism to delete surfaces in the array until the complex surface is destroyed.

For a texture, there is a linear/user version of the texture and n swizzled/harware versions of the texture.  5force "garbage collecting"*To sum up.SUM UP Each renaming list is circular list that grows on demand. The block manager can walk through all the blocks to force some garbage collecting. Each texture or VB sees only its private list. A texture is composed of two MipLevelSet. One is meant for linear/user purpose. The second one is for swizzle/harware purpose only. The user/linear MipLevelSet will own only one block. The swizzle/harware may contain an unlimited number of blocks. SUM UP CBlockList CBlockList CBlockDescriptor * m_Active; int m_nb; int m_max; int m_min; CBlockList CBlockDescriptor * m_Active; int m_nb; int m_max; int m_min; The BM sees all blocks linked together as a simple forward linked list. The BM can walk though this list and get rid of some blocks if some need memory is need or upon explicit call. Each block descritor has a back pointer to the CBlockList structure that owns it, so the block manager can update stats and ajust counters for this list when the action is not initiated by the texture or the vertex buffer (ex: garbage collecting). The BM sees one list of blocks. Each CMipLevelSet or VB gives his CBlockList to the BM each time it asks some services to it. The BM can update this private list. This private list is a circular double linked list. Each time we need renaming, the BM is going to look the next block in the list. That should be the oldest one (in this list). If it not being used by the hardware anymore, we return this one (we can adjust its size if needed).  If the list is full with hardware "being used" or "going to be used" blocks, the BM allocates a new one and links it in this list. If the number of "not used anymore" blocks is greater than a limit, we can move some blocks to the "free" (!!!not "pending free"!!!) list. This "free" list acts as a cache for allocations (these bloc don't belong to any list anymore). We can discard the blocks in the free list on a size or time basis (we don't keep a cached larger than 300k, not more than 30 items, not older than n clock ticks...). Some blocks could be reused if the size we need is more than 80%. The CBlockList is a convenient data structure since it collects information about the private list (nb, stats). It owned by a Texture or a VB and the BM can write in it, since it receives the address of this structure each time some services are asked for.  CBlockList A VertexBuffer or a MipLevelSet owns as a structure CBlockList. This is a representant of the list of all the blocks of memory involved at this time in this vertex buffer. This structure collects variables describing the list like the active block, the number of blocks, the number of "pending free" blocks in this list. The "pending free blocks" stay in the circular list. The CBlockList is a convenient data structure since it collects information about the private list (nb, stats). It owned by a Texture or a VB and the BM can write in it, since it receives the address of this structure each time some services are asked for.

NV_ESCAPE_ID and NV_ESCAPE_ID_RETURN define a GDI ESCAPE to verify what driver
is currently running.  IHV's that receive display driver source code should
substitute their own private mechanism.  Note that it is a WHQL failure to have
IHV property pages and NVIDIA property pages active at the same time.
  
  
IHV's that do not receive display driver source code should define the
following in NVVER.H, and also make sure that the filenames for the control
panel binaries are the same as NVIDIA's (this prevents the two sets of pages
being active at the same time).

makekrnl.bat
------------

	This file is to be run from \xbox\private\ntos\ dir.  Will build xboxkrnl.exe
	and will be placed in \xbox\private\ntos\obj\

linkmap.txt
-----------
	This file is to be placed in \xbox\private\ntos\
	makekrnl.bat uses it.


This should be enough to compile using the pre made .obj files.

Now to re-compile a .c/.cpp file

I have been creating batch files for each lib

which consists of 3 files.  makeobj.bat makelib.bat and {lib name}libmap.txt

{lib name}libmap.txt
--------------------
	This is like linkmap.txt for the kernel, it can be generated by looking at the build.log
	and gathering the lines underneath the lib command.   Then editing the references
	to the files.

makeobj.bat
-----------
	Has to be placed in the dir with the makefile.  For instance for ani2 it goes in
	\ntos\ani2\lib For dir's like ldrx and idex it goes into \ntos\ldrx\console\ and
        \ntos\idex\console

	To use it, say you were in \ntos\idex\console and you want to recompile cdrom.obj
	and idex.obj (so you can remake idexcon.lib)

	you would type 'makeobj cdrom' then 'makeobj idex' (that would reproduce the .obj files)
	
	(then you would do makelib and it would make a new idexcon.lib, then makekrnl to produce
	a new xboxkrnl.exe)

makelib.bat
-----------
	same directory as makeobj.bat.  To create one find the .lib file create command in
	build.log and reference the file {lib name}libmap.txt instead of the c:\winnt\temp crap

	after you have your .obj files, in the same dir as your makelib, type 'makelib'.

	

some stuff has been hardcoded in the makeobj.bat's and makelib.bat's you will need to fix them


For retail, I used the 2bl and extra from evox 2.5 retail, retail key, and the kernel works fine...

=========
 General
=========

- We don't support any protocol other than TCP/IP.
- We're strictly a client-side implementation.
- Overall priorities are:
    code simplicity / compactness
    performance
    resource consumption
- Adjustable configuration parameters are stored
  in global variables with 'cfg' name prefix.

===================
 Buffer management
===================

- There are two kinds of packets:
    regular packets allocated out of pool memory, and
    DMA packets allocated inside contiguous physical page
- We maintain a few lookaside lists for smaller-sized regular packets.
- DMA packets are fixed size, ~half a page and large enough
  to hold an Ethernet frame.
- When packets are passed around, the callee takes over the ownership
  of the packet. When the callee is done with the packet, it calls
  CompletePacket to dispose of it. Exception to this rule will be
  explicitly noted.

============
 Interfaces
============

- Each interface has only one IP address.
- Interfaces supported:
    Ethernet
    PPP over USB serial modem
    PPP over Ethernet
    loopback
- Ethernet:
    receive both Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 frames
    send Ethernet frames only
    assume we hear our own broadcast/multicast transmissions
- Default ARP configuration parameters:
    positive ARP cache entry timeout = 10min
    negative ARP cache entry timeout = 1min
    ARP request retry count = 2

========
IP Layer
========

- We implement "Strong End-System" model, i.e.
    when a datagram arrives on an interface, the destination
    address must match that interface's address (or an
    approriate broadcast / multicast address)
- We only support the all-1's form of broadcast addresses.
- We do NOT support fragmentation on outgoing datagrams.
- The default size limit for reassembled datagrams is 2048 bytes
  and the default reassembly timeout period is 60sec.
- By default, the maximum number of datagrams that can be reassembled
  simultaneously is 4.
- Subnet-directed broadcast are not received locally.

=======
Winsock
=======

- Our socket handles are not file handles, i.e.
  you can NOT call Read/WriteFile APIs on them.
- Only limited validatation is performed on socket handles
  passed into the API calls. If app passes in a random
  handle value, the resulting behavior will be undefined.
- Overlapped completion routines are not supported.
- Since our socket handles are not file handles, apps can NOT
  call CancelIO API to cancel outstanding overlapped I/O requests.
  Apps must call WSACancelOverlappedIO function instead.
- We claim to support the following Winsock versions:
    1.0, 1.1
    2.0, 2.1, 2.2
- But we don't support 1.x blocking hooks, i.e. the following calls are
  not supported:
    WSASetBlockingHook
    WSAUnhookBlockingHook
    WSACancelBlockingCall
    WSAIsBlocking
- Following calls from Winsock 2 are NOT supported:
    WSAAsyncGetHostByAddr
    WSAAsyncGetHostByName
    WSAAsyncGetProtoByName
    WSAAsyncGetProtoByNumber
    WSAAsyncGetServByName
    WSAAsyncGetServByPort
    WSAAsyncSelect
    WSACancelAsyncRequest
    WSADuplicateSocket
    WSAGetQOSByName
    WSAJoinLeaf
    WSAProviderConfigChange
    WSARecvDisconnect
    WSASendDisconnect
    WSAHtonl
    WSAHtons
    WSANtohl
    WSANtohs
    WSAAddressToString
    WSAStringToAddress
    WSASocket
    WSAAccept
    WSAConnect
    WSAIoctl
    WSAEventSelect
    WSAEnumProtocols
    WSAEnumNetworkEvents
    WSALookupServiceBegin
    WSALookupServiceNext
    WSALookupServiceEnd
    WSAInstallServiceClass
    WSARemoveServiceClass
    WSAGetServiceClassInfo
    WSAEnumNameSpaceProviders
    WSAGetServiceClassNameByClassId
    WSASetService
- closesocket always return immediately. If SO_LINGER is on and
  timeout is non-zero, we use the graceful close semantics (i.e.
  as if SO_DONTLINGER is on).
- For send calls, we don't support MSG_OOB and MSG_PARTIAL flags
  and ignore MSG_DONTROUTE.
- For recv calls, we don't support MSG_OOB and MSB_PARTIAL flags.
  MSG_PEEK flag is supported for datagram sockets.
- For WSARecv calls, we do not support more than one buffers.
- We do not support more than one outstanding overlapped I/O requests.
- We don't allow multiple threads to use the same socket handle simultanenously.
  If two threads try to use the same socket handle at the same time, the first
  one succeeds and the second one fails with a busy error.

Issues
======

- need to pass TCP related ICMP messages from IP layer to TCP layer
- path MTU discovery
- dead gateway detection
- implement TCP urgent data?
- support source route IP options for TCP connections?
- do receive work in a separate system thread
  instead of at DISPATCH_LEVEL?

; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory.
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off
; the root of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).
; If there are multiple class names for a single image, use a colon to separate
; each.
;
; All bits that ship in the NT base product and are installed with winnt32,
; must have a class name of retail.
;
; If you add a new file to the list, please refrain from creating your own
; special section.  Doing so makes it difficult to detect duplicates.  If
; you're unable to add your image due to a collision with an existing name,
; work it out with the other developer.  Options include creating another
; placefil.txt for your project or using the ALT_PROJECT_TARGET macro in your
; sources file to change the base of the distribution point (doing so means
; your project will not install as part of base NT).
;
;     sort /+17 < placefil.txt > placefil.srt
;
; will generate a list sorted by class name if you want.
;
; IMPORTANT NOTE:
;
; If you add a file to the system, YOU MUST make sure layout.inf is updated
; before you start depending on it or else you will cause a BVT break. Do
; not attempt to modify layout.inf yourself, but follow instructions on:

I found multiple copies of the 'XONLINE_MAIN' directory, and they all differed. They had a lot of files in common, but also additional files, missing files, and files that had a different MD5 hash (same file name, different data). Since these directories are pretty large, I came up with an idea to save space. I used one of the directories, the one that's the most complete (the largest, the most files), to be the main directory ('XONLINE_MAIN').

I deleted files from the lesser directories that were duplicates (same MD5 hash) of files from the main directory. I made lists of the files (from the main directory), that used to also be in 'XONLINE_MAIN_2' and 'XONLINE_MAIN_3'. So, anyone who wants to restore those directories back to their original state can just make a small script, a simple while loop really, and automatically copy those files back from the main directory (using the file lists) to 'XONLINE_MAIN_2' and 'XONLINE_MAIN_3'.

The file lists are named after the directory they belong to.

Here's an example of a command to copy the files back to 'XONLINE_MAIN_2':

tr -d '\r' <"XONLINE_MAIN_2.txt" | while read f; do cp -p "XONLINE_MAIN/${f}" "XONLINE_MAIN_2/${f}" || break; done

(It's a Linux command and won't work in Windows.)

***

The source of the 'XONLINE_MAIN' directories seems to be a HDD dump by a member (probably Nathan Leroux) of the hacker group known as the 'Xbox Underground'. I'm not 100% sure about this, but I came to this conclusion from analyzing the rest of the data in my source, along with reading an article on WIRED about the Xbox Underground.

This is the article:
