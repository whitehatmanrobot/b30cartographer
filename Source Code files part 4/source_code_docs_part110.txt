he server, or are renamed to some other file/directory while offline, are removed from the server namespace. We have the copies of those files/directories which got renamed, into the temp directory and will use these when we get to pass 2. Example:  If for the UNC path   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\dir2\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\dir2\foo.txt  as obtained by traversing the original tree of the CSC database,  <IP1,  foo.txt >(X, X, IORG1, X)  IORG1(X, X, UOI, X) and <IP2,  , R, IORG2, X)        IORG2(X, X, OI, X) Then delete foo.txt on the server then rename dir1 to ASCII(IORG2) Pass 2: Starting from the root, traverse the current tree in the CSC database, thus for a directory <IP1,  >(I, X, X, X), traverse I, while accumulating the UNC path up to I For every entry that is marked L, R, M, IE. it is either  created offline due to create/rename or  is a replica that has gone through a delete/create or rename/create cycle while offline or  is a replica whose contents have been modified offline in some way. So if it is a file, it s data /attributes/timestamps have been modified while offline, or if it is a directory, some entries have been added/deleted or attributes/timestamps of the directory have been modified while offline) the entry is marked L or R and the Inode is marked OI,  <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, OI, X) Then this is a new entry created offline from the contents of an Original Inode (through one or more renames). Check in the Original Conflicts list whether there is an entry corresponding to I. If there is no conflict,  Then there must be an item ASCII(I) on the server, rename that entry to the accumulated UNC name. If the rename operation fails, then attach the entry to the list we call CurrentConflictList. Note that this is a second conflict list which is different from the OriginalConflictList. The CurrentConflictList has UNC names that correspond to the current namespace if all reintegration had succeeded. If the rename operation succeeds then Convert the new entry to a replica using the following transformation <IP1,  >(I, L, NULL, X) => <IP1,  >(I, 0, I, X) stamp it with the timestamp from the entry from the server. Else  it exists in the conflict list, we cannot reintegrate this entry, ignore it and all it s descendents.  Else if it is marked L or R and the Inode is marked LI IE it is represented as <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, LI, X) Then this represents a new name and new content. Create it.  If create succeeds <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) I(X, X, LI, X) => I(X, X, OI, X) ignore all it s descendents Else if it is marked as D Ignore it, it must be in the conflicts list or else it would have been taken care of in pass 1 Else if it is marked M IE the contents of a remote entry have been modified offline; it is represented by <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) I(IP, X, OI, X) Modify it on the server If modification succeeds  Remove the marking M from the entry IE <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) ignore all it s descendents Note: The problem of cross-linked remote entries is side stepped because of the way renaming is accomplished during reintegration. Pass 3:  This is a cleanup pass. The key cleanup we do here is to remove those entries that have been renamed to some other entries. In pass 2, the renamed entries have already been associated to the appropriate contents. Traverse the original tree ( we could also traverse the current tree as it is a superset of the original tree) for every entry that is marked as D or R and the IORG is marked as OI,  If IORG is not in the ConflictList then it has been assigned to some other name Delete the directory entry while keeping the inode. Traverse the OriginalConflictList from it s head to tail and rename back all the entries from the temporary directory to their original UNC names as maintained in the OriginalConflictsList. Delete the temp directory itself. {xuro |yvspmjb }ume]U

The database is organized as a tree structure. The root-node of the tree(henceforth referred to as the super-root) contains a list of shares that have been successfully connected in the past. Each entry in the this list points to the root directory of that share. A node in the tree is either a directory node or a file node, the latter always being a leaf node.  Each node in the tree is uniquely identified by a 32 bit number called the Inode. All inodes are part of an inode table, which also does double duty as a priority queue. Moreover, given an Inode it is possible to obtain the fully qualified UNC path which represents the Inode. As an implementation detail, each inode is nothing but an index in the inode table. Each node in the database is represented by a file. The files are named by converting their Inode number to an 8 hex-digit ASCII value and are in a well know directory. The super root is 00000001 while the Inode table is 00000002. The directory inode files contain the information about  the children of that directory., in the form of a sequence of directory entries as described in DE below. The file inode files contain the actual contents of the file.  Inode table entry  notation  An inode I is represented as I(IP, S, IC, FOI, all other attributes) as follows 32 bit parent Inode # - for the root if a share, this value is 0 Contents associated with the inode. For a file this the entire file data. For a directory this  is the set of directory entries. Inode Attribute (Enumerated type) -       OI stands for original  Inode. Indicates that the contents of this  inode  originally came from the net and is in use. UOI, stands for Unassociated Original Inode LI, stands for Local Inode. This has the content created offline. NB: There is no such thing as an ULI, ie: Unassociated Local Inode. Other Information - Sync Status, duplicated for the sake of the agent - UI information (See the directory entry below) - forward and backward pointers pointing to other inodes forming a  doubly linked MRU list.  These entries are used in deciding which entries to scavenge if the CSC database grows beyond a prespecified disk quota. Directory entry notation: An entry with the name   in a directory represented by inode IP is represented as <IP,  >(Current Inode, Sync Status, Original Inode, RenameFrom Inode, All Other Attributes)  Current Inode The inode that currently has the contents of this entry Synchronization Status Status  (bit field) S - Sparse This bit is set only for server objects. Files are marked sparse when the contents L - created offlline Object which is created while in disconnected state D - marked as deleted An object is marked deleted when it is obtained from the  Server or currently has directory contents from a directory on  the server R - reused  An object from the server that is marked deleted and is  recreated DM - Data modified offline (Cannot coexist with L above) An object from the server whose data has gone through some  Change while offline AM - An object whose attributes have gone through some change while  Offline. This includes, directory attribbutes and last modified  Original Inode: The Inode which represents the contents cached from the server.  For a replica, the The Current Indoe and the Original Inode are Identical when the entry has not gone through a namespace operation while  offline All Other Attributes Last Modified Time from the server Used to detect conflicts UI Information Whether the entry is pinned for a user Whether the entry is pinned for system Pin count when an entry is pinned for neither user nor system Filesystem Attributes:  (referred to as FA, as a group) Name(s): Both LFN and 8.3 names Filesystem Attributes:  filesystem attributes last modified time Security Attributes Per user maximal access rights for N user. The current value of N is 4. Other Notations: t care. ie. the contents of the field are immaterial denotes a non-exitent Inode Empty denotes 0 sized contents of an Inode inidcates no flags set indicates a value of any of the above types that needs to be retained while carrying out a transformation Parent Inode of I Namespace Operations: There are four possible modes of operations of the redir with respect to CSC, depending the type of the share that is being accessed. CSC disabled shares Under this mode, no caching is done for this share. Offline operations fail with appropriate errors. Explicit pinning is also disabled. Auto_Reintegration Shares Under this mode, while online, every file that is opened on the share is cached in the CSC database under it s namespace as found on the share.  It is OK to pin files. Any part of the namespace that has been marked as having been modified offline is invisible when offline. This situation can occur when the share went offline and modifications were done wither to file data or the namespace changed through create/delete/rename operations. Then when it went online, either no-reintegration was performed or all the modifications could not be reintegrated. While online the redir operates as if the CSC database were a write-through cache. This is the  truth is on the server  mode of operations. The remote and the local copes are opened for files in sync, read operations are satisfied locally, while write operations are done on the server and on the local file. Example of invisible namespace: if a file   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\foo.txt  that was cached online and modified offline, did not get reintegrated, then when online this copy is not visible, only the server copy is. Non_Auto_Reintration shares The principal difference between this and Auto_reintgeration share is that files are not cached when they are opened. All other details remain the same. The fact that these are no_auto_reintegration shares means that UI needs to explicitly ask questions or invoke some other means of bringing the user in the loop while doing reintegration. VDO shares The files under these shares get cached when opened. For those files that are fully cached in the database, the files opened locally and all operations are satisfied locally. This is the  truth is on the client  mode. What follows is a description of how the namespace operations are performed  by CSC. The operations are described in the notation defined above. They are split into two types a) Online and b) Offline.  When online, a name that has been created/modified/marked-deleted while offline and not successfully integrated is made invisible during online operations.  The operations below describe the namespace operations. VDO shares operate in offline mode for files fully cached and in online mode for files not fully cached. IRenameFrom and IORG elements of the data structure make it possible to translate the localname into the remote name and vice-versa. Lookup: Given a fully qualified UNC path such as \\server\share\dir1\dir2..\dirn\file1, The path is broken down item by item to find the Inode that represents the item in the hierarchy. This \\server\share are looked up in the super-root, and the root Inode corresponding to \\server\share is found.  Henceforth we will refer to the root inode corresponding to any share as I0. Given I0 (say 0x10), find the inode file corresponding to I0 (00000010), run through the list of  DEs in this file matching dir1 in the above example and obtain the Inode corresponding to dir1 I1. Traverse I1 to look for the name dir2 and so on till the name file1 is obtained from In. Create Operations Online: Create a replica of remote item   under a directory represented by IP - Create IORG(IP, Empty, OI, X) - Create <IP, >(IORG, 0, IORG, X) Offline: a) Create a new item   in offline state under the directory represented by IP - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) - Create <IP,  >(I, L, I, X) b) Create a new item which is of the same name as a server item marked deleted: - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) <IP,  , D, IORG, X) => <IP, >(I, R, IORG, X) delete I Delete Operation Online: Delete a replica of   from directory represented by IP If the server operation succeeds and the database entry and all it s ancestors are in sync with the server then - delete <IP,  >(IORG,0,IORG,NULL,X) - delete IORG(IP,0,X,OI,X) - delete contents of IORG Offline: a) Delete a replica of an item   from directory represented by IP 1) <IP,  >(IORG, 0, IORG, X)    => <IP, >(NULL, D, IORG, X) 2) IORG(IP,  X,OI, X)  => IORG(IP, Empty, UOI, X) Truncate the contents of the inode IORG if foo is a file. If foo is a directory, then we want to keep the contents of IORG, which are the directory entries of foo cached from the server. Comments: Associate a NULL inode with <IP, >,  note the original contents in IORG field and mark the entry  D (deleted). Mark the Inode which represents the original contents as Unassociated Origianl Inode. b) Delete   created in offline state in directory IP.  Delete <IP,  >(I, L, I, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) c) Delete   reused in offline state in directory IP.  <IP,  >(I, R, IORG, X) => <IP,  >(NULL, D, IORG, X) Delete <IP,  >(I, L, L, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be marked OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) Rename Rename item   in directory IP1 to item   in directory  Online: - Save all the attributes of foo - Delete <IP1,  foo>(I,V,V,V) - Create <IP2,  >(I,V,V,V)  - I(IP1,V,V, V) => I(IP2,V,V, V) Offline: -      Save all the attributes of  <IP1,  Execute offline delete of foo as done above, except for any Original Inode and it s content Execute offline Create of bar with all the attributes of foo, including it s inode Reintegration The reintegartion of a share is a 3 pass operation, the passes being  Remove all the files/directories from the server that have been deleted and renamed  when offline to a holding directory.  This step essentially remove the elements from the server name space which after a successfull reintegration should not be there. Create elemnts on the server corresponding to the new namespace that is generated while offline. Restore the state on the database and the server, based on the conflicts encountered. Initialization: Create a temporary  directory on the server(say reint). This directory is our holding directory for various files/directories. Create two conflict lists, OriginalConflictList and CurrentConflictList.  Pass 1: Starting from the root of a share, do a depth first traversal of the original tree. This is done by traversing  the  IORG inode of a directory. Only the directories which are replicas of a directory on the server will have this entry. While traversing the original tree in a depth first manner, for all entries which are either marked D (deleted) or R (Reused), ie. entries of the type <IP1, >(X, D, IORG, X) or  <IP1, foo>(X, R, IORG, X).        - Accumulate the original UNC path as obtained from the original tree in the CSC database. In depth first order, ie. leaf first then it s immediate parent then it s parent etc.,  If there is no conflict between the version of the replica and the server copy If it is marked D or R (deleted offline, or deleted offline and then later reused) If the IORG is marked as Unassociated Original Inode (UOI), then this entry has been deleted and it s contents have been deleted (may be through a simple delete or one or more renames followed by a delete).  If Delete of the entity on the server succeeds or this is a directory, in which case the failure to delete is treated as benign conflict. Delete the entry from the database Delete the IORG inode Delete the contents associated with IORG. Else this must have been renamed to some other entry do a rename on the server of the file/directory with the accumulated UNC path to the temp directory on the server,  the new name being the same as that of the IORG entry. This ensures no name collision in the temp directory, as the inodes are unique. Let us call the name in the temporary directory ASCII(IORG), for the item with IORG as the original Inode, on the server that has been renamed to ASCII equivalent of it's Inode name in the temp directory.  If there is a conflict, ie. the file/directory on the server is newer than the one in the CSC database, or an operation fails, attach the original UNC name together with  it s current  Inode to the head of conflict list we call the OriginalConflictsList. We use this in pass two to find if any newly created entries are conflicting, and in pass 3 to restore the saved entries back into the original namespace. This ensures that, all the files and directories which are supposed to either have been deleted from the server, or are renamed to some other file/directory while offline, are removed from the server namespace. We have the copies of those files/directories which got renamed, into the temp directory and will use these when we get to pass 2. Example:  If for the UNC path   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\dir2\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\dir2\foo.txt  as obtained by traversing the original tree of the CSC database,  <IP1,  foo.txt >(X, X, IORG1, X)  IORG1(X, X, UOI, X) and <IP2,  , R, IORG2, X)        IORG2(X, X, OI, X) Then delete foo.txt on the server then rename dir1 to ASCII(IORG2) Pass 2: Starting from the root, traverse the current tree in the CSC database, thus for a directory <IP1,  >(I, X, X, X), traverse I, while accumulating the UNC path up to I For every entry that is marked L, R, M, IE. it is either  created offline due to create/rename or  is a replica that has gone through a delete/create or rename/create cycle while offline or  is a replica whose contents have been modified offline in some way. So if it is a file, it s data /attributes/timestamps have been modified while offline, or if it is a directory, some entries have been added/deleted or attributes/timestamps of the directory have been modified while offline) the entry is marked L or R and the Inode is marked OI,  <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, OI, X) Then this is a new entry created offline from the contents of an Original Inode (through one or more renames). Check in the Original Conflicts list whether there is an entry corresponding to I. If there is no conflict,  Then there must be an item ASCII(I) on the server, rename that entry to the accumulated UNC name. If the rename operation fails, then attach the entry to the list we call CurrentConflictList. Note that this is a second conflict list which is different from the OriginalConflictList. The CurrentConflictList has UNC names that correspond to the current namespace if all reintegration had succeeded. If the rename operation succeeds then Convert the new entry to a replica using the following transformation <IP1,  >(I, L, NULL, X) => <IP1,  >(I, 0, I, X) stamp it with the timestamp from the entry from the server. Else  it exists in the conflict list, we cannot reintegrate this entry, ignore it and all it s descendents.  Else if it is marked L or R and the Inode is marked LI IE it is represented as <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, LI, X) Then this represents a new name and new content. Create it.  If create succeeds <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) I(X, X, LI, X) => I(X, X, OI, X) ignore all it s descendents Else if it is marked as D Ignore it, it must be in the conflicts list or else it would have been taken care of in pass 1 Else if it is marked M IE the contents of a remote entry have been modified offline; it is represented by <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) I(IP, X, OI, X) Modify it on the server If modification succeeds  Remove the marking M from the entry IE <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) ignore all it s descendents Note: The problem of cross-linked remote entries is side stepped because of the way renaming is accomplished during reintegration. Pass 3:  This is a cleanup pass. The key cleanup we do here is to remove those entries that have been renamed to some other entries. In pass 2, the renamed entries have already been associated to the appropriate contents. Traverse the original tree ( we could also traverse the current tree as it is a superset of the original tree) for every entry that is marked as D or R and the IORG is marked as OI,  If IORG is not in the ConflictList then it has been assigned to some other name Delete the directory entry while keeping the inode. Traverse the OriginalConflictList from it s head to tail and rename back all the entries from the temporary directory to their original UNC names as maintained in the OriginalConflictsList. Delete the temp directory itself. {xuro |yvspmjb }ume]U

1. the rule on the pagingio resource is that you have to take it exclusive if you are shrinking
the file of if you are wrapping. otherwise you can take it shared. fat just cycles thru 16
resources that it shared with hpfs; initially, we will do the same....later we may change to a
resource per fcb in the same way as rdr1 and ntfs.

This short note will potentially explain the states and transitions
available on an FCB complex. For those just tuning in, a fileobject (FO)
refers to an FCB (File Control Block) and an FOBX (File Object
Extension). There is a 1-1 correspondence between FOs and FOBXs. Many
FOs may/will refer to the same FCB which represents a single file
somewhere on some server. A client may have several different opens
(NtCreates) on the same FCB and each of these will create a new file
object. What is interesting is that the rdr may choose to send fewer
SMBcreates than it receives NtCreates in effect sharing a server-open
(SVROPEN) among several FOBXs.

Another interesting tidbit is that the rdr doesn't necessarily close its
SRVOPENs when the user opens close hoping that it can reuse the open and
the data without any contact with the server. We say that an FCB is
client-side-open (CSO) if there are user opens openstanding on the FCB.
It is server-side-open is there are existing SRVOPENs on the FCB. From
all of this, the following table explains what can happen on a user open
(assuming the netroot is good):

   Create?  CS-Open?   SS-Open?    Action
   -----------------------------------------
     Yes      Open      Open       ERROR
              Open     Closed      IMPOSSIBLE
             Closed     Open       CloseAllSrvOpens();NewOpen()
             Closed    Closed      NewOpen()
     No       Open      Open       NotSharable()-->NewOpen()
              Open     Closed      IMPOSSIBLE
             Closed     Open       NotSharable()-->NewOpen()
             Closed    Closed      NewOpen()

Thus, it actually boils down to a pretty simple scheme:

        (Create && CS-Open) ==> return ERROR;
        (Create && SS-Open && !CS-Open) ==> CloseAllSrvOpens();
        (NotShareable()) ==> return NewOpen();
        return SharableOpen();


A careful review here shows us what must happen on cleanup:
specifically, we must do whatever it takes to cleanup the clientside as
appropriate.  Further, if the open is the last user open and
DELETE-ON-CLOSE or TRUNCATE-ON-CLOSE are operative, then we must drive
the FCB into the CLOSED/CLOSED state; otherwise, we may elect to leave
SRVOPENs open even if there are no current opens.  Since the subrdr is
the best judge of whether closing or keeping is appropriate, we call
down on the transition (SRXSrvOpenTransitioningToClosed).  When the
subrdr gets this call, it may elect to (a) close the current SRVOPEN,
(b) close SRVOPENs with no associated user opens, (c) do nothing and
rely on the RDBSS to call down for real closes at the correct time.

If the subrdr chooses to allow the SRVOPEN to remain, the RDBSS will
take some steps close ones that remain according to some criteria that
(a) haven't been worked out yet and (b) need to be very flexible.
Probably this will be another calldown (SRXClosedSrvOpenTimeOut).  The
same is true of the FCB itself....after some reasonbale period, it and
the cached data (if any) that it represents should be finalized.
Another pair of calldowns (i.e.  SRXFcbTransitioningToClosed and
SRXClosedFcbTimeOut).

So, the following sums it up for cleanup:

(Delete||Truncate)&&LastCSOpenPerFcb => CloseAllSrvOpens();
ELSE  LastCSOpenPerSrvOpen => SRXSrvOpenTransitioningToClosed();
ELSE (we'll do it on a timer)

Notice that if the subrdr wants to do something aggressive like close
the srvopen and finalize, then it will have to take out the appropriate
locks itself. The RDBSS isn't going to take the locks just so the subrdr
can say "no, thx". Currently, we uninitialize the cachemap as well and
count on the winding down logic of CM/MM to keep the map open for some
time....we will consider later forcing the CM to stay open (for example,
by putting our own reference on the fileobject).

1) Copy rdbss.sys and mrxsmb.sys to system32\drivers directory.

2) copy the .ini/.bat files to the directory of your choice from the appropriate
   sub directory SUR/CAIRO.

3) run setup.bat -- This initializes the registry.

3) Reboot the system. The system will come up with the new rdr. The new rdr will be
active as long as it is correctly loaded / unloaded. If the new redirector
fails the workstation service switches over to the old redirector. In order
to switch over to the new redirector run the following command and reboot
        regini rdr2.ini

NOTE: Under Cairo the reboot is required because DFS keeps the Redirector
device open. Under SUR this in conjunction with net start/stop rdr toggles
between the old and the new one.

4) For CAIRO in order to switch to the old redirector use the following
   commands ..

   regini rdr.ini
   regini rdrdfs.ini

   and reboot.

   Similarly for the new redirector use the following commands

   regini rdr2.ini
   regini rdr2dfs.ini

   and reboot.

Douceur and William J. Bolosky Microsoft Research johndo@microsoft.com Abstract Background processes are intended not to interfere with the performance of normal foreground processes.  CPU scheduling priority is often used to keep a process in the background, but this assumes that the CPU is the limiting resource.  When another resource   such as disk or memory   is the limiting factor, the CPU is uncontended, so scheduling priority is insufficient to prevent interference with foreground processes.  When one process interferes with the performance of another due to resource contention, the interference is likely to be reciprocal, and certain design characteristics can ensure that it is.  We have developed a technology, called MS Manners, that measures the performance of a background task and suspends its execution whenever the performance appears to be degraded, since this indicates that the putative background task is likely to be degrading the performance of another process.  This mechanism is general in the sense that the mutual performance degradation can be caused by contention over virtually any system resource.  MS Manners deals effectively with the stochastic nature of performance measurements, and it allows multiple tasks to execute in the background without interfering with each other.  It also automatically calibrates its performance targets, so no environment-specific tuning is required by the designer of the background process.  No changes to kernel code are required for implementation. Introduction Many computer systems support tasks that are executed as background processes.  Often, such processes perform housekeeping functions that are important to complete eventually but not necessarily promptly, such as file compression, disk de-fragmentation, file-system content indexing, and file archiving.  In general, processes that perform background tasks are implemented in the form of system services or daemons, and they are intended to execute primarily when the machine is otherwise idle, so as not to interfere with the foreground processes immediately visible to the interactive users of the computer system. The traditional approach [Dijkstra 78, Lampson 84, Manber 84, Ohr 84] to performing a task in the background is to assign the process a priority level commensurate with   or just above   that of the system idle process, thereby allotting CPU cycles to the process only when no normal-priority process is ready to use the CPU.  For example, the Unix command nice [AT&T 90] initiates a process with reduced scheduling priority, which may be as low as the idle priority level.  The command name presumably reflects the assumption that an idle-priority process will not interfere substantially with the performance of a normal-priority process, thus making the behavior of the idle-priority process  nice. Governing a process s execution through priority-based scheduling assumes that the CPU is always the limiting resource.  However, for many applications, such as those listed above relating to file-system housekeeping, process performance is limited not by CPU speed but by I/O rate and/or latency.  More broadly, the performance of a process may be limited by any system resource   disk [Smith 85], processor cache [McKee 95a, Temam 94], memory capacity [Belady 66, Chapin 97], memory bandwidth [McKee 95b, Moyer 94], etc.   so contention for any of these resources can cause one process to degrade the performance of another.  In these cases, process priority is insufficient as a mechanism for limiting the interference of background processes. As an example, consider a process that repeatedly performs 10 ms of computation followed by a 15-ms synchronous I/O operation.  When this process is running on an otherwise idle machine, the CPU is in use only 40% of the time.  For two concurrently executing processes with this same execution profile, if the processes access different I/O resources, then each can use the CPU during the time that the other is waiting for an I/O completion, as illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1: Symmetric processes accessing different I/O resources The CPU is in use 80% of the time, and each process executes just as quickly as it would have if the other process had not been running, illustrating a familiar argument for multiprogramming.  (For simplicity, in this example and those that immediately follow, we ignore secondary effects such as increased cache miss rate due to context switches, and we assume perfect process scheduling.) If the two processes illustrated in Figure 1 access the same resource, rather than different resources, then each process experiences an additional delay in its synchronous I/O operation, because it is forced to wait for the other process s I/O operation to complete before its own I/O operation can begin, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2: Symmetric processes accessing same I/O resource In this example, the CPU will be in use 67% of the time, and each process will experience a 17% slowdown in its execution rate relative to that on an otherwise idle machine.  In many circumstances, the per-process performance degradation is an acceptable trade-off against the increase in overall throughput from running the two processes concurrently.  However, if process A is a foreground process, and process B is a background process, then it is undesirable to allow process B to retard process A, despite the effect on overall throughput. It is clear from this example why priority scheduling will fail to prevent process B from interfering with process A:  In the schedule of Figure 2, the CPU is never a contended resource, so prioritization of processes on the CPU will have no effect whatsoever.  Process A can continue to progress at its maximal rate only if process B ceases or suspends execution; otherwise, process A will be unable to perform useful work during some portion of each I/O operation of process B. This paper addresses the question of how to determine when a background process needs to throttle its execution in order to allow a foreground process to proceed unimpeded.  We call the technology that answers this question MS Manners, because it tells us how to make a process really nice.  Whereas priority-based approaches are inherently passive, we consider techniques for actively preventing a background process from interfering with foreground processes.  We use the term  active inconspicuity  to refer to this approach. The inspiration for our approach is suggested by the execution schedules depicted in Figures 1 and 2:  In these examples, when process B is retarding the progress of process A, process A is also retarding the progress of process B.  Process B can thus monitor its own rate of progress, and if it detects a degradation in its performance, it concludes that it is effecting a corresponding degradation in the performance of another process, indicating that it should temporarily suspend its own execution. Unfortunately, this detection technique is neither complete nor consistent, because progress interference is not guaranteed to be symmetric, as illustrated by the schedule in Figure 3. Figure 3: Asymmetric processes accessing same I/O resource In this example, process A has the same execution profile as that of the processes in the previous examples; however, process B has an execution profile that consumes a greater amount of the CPU: 15 ms per I/O operation rather than 10 ms.  Consequently, process B retards the progress of process A, but process A does not retard the progress of process B, so process B fails to realize that it should temporarily suspend its execution.  This situation occurs only because the entire I/O operation of process A can be performed during the computation of process B, so it completes before the I/O operation of process B begins. This phenomenon can be avoided by overlapping all computation with asynchronous I/O, so that the background process displays an execution profile in which I/O operations are issued continually, as illustrated in Figure 4.  With such an execution profile, there is no window into which another process could slip an I/O operation unnoticed.  It seems likely that I/O-intensive applications, such as those listed above, could be made to display such an execution profile, enabling them to circumvent this failure at recognizing interference.  In particular, the application that we use as a working example for the bulk of this paper displays an execution profile very much like the one illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4: Overlapping computation with I/O If the execution profiles of the two processes in Figure 3 are reversed, then the background process will notice a degradation in its progress, from which it will incorrectly conclude that it is interfering with the progress of another process.  If this conclusion causes the background process to suspend its execution, then overall throughput may suffer unnecessarily, but at least the foreground process will not be inappropriately retarded.  In the present context, we regard hypersensitivity as a lesser problem than insensitivity, so we consider this property of our solution to be acceptable if somewhat undesirable.  Furthermore, given a background execution profile like that in Figure 4, this condition will only occur if the foreground process issues each I/O request immediately before the background process issues one of its I/O requests.  If the foreground process issues an I/O request either earlier or later, then it will experience some performance degradation from waiting on a background I/O operation to complete.  Therefore, a false detection of this sort is highly unlikely to occur in practice, and we have not observed such an occurrence in our experiments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 describes a specific application context in which we implemented and tested the technology for active inconspicuity.  Section 3 outlines the MS Manners architecture, and Section 4 extends this architecture to multiple background tasks.  Our methodology relies on the self-observation procedure described above, but in a real system, the timing of I/O operations is highly variable, so Section 5 presents the statistical mechanism we employ to cope with the stochastic nature of the measurement data.  Since our system compares measured performance versus target performance, the latter must be determined in some manner, so Section 6 describes how the system automatically calibrates its performance target.  Automatic calibration obviates the need for environment-specific tuning; however, there are several configuration parameters that are available for an application designer to modify as desired, and Section 7 describes these parameters and characterizes their effect on the system.  Section 8 presents performance results of MS Manners in the application example of Section 2.  Sections 9 and 10 wrap up with related work and conclusions. Example Application This section describes the SIS Groveler, an example application in which the MS Manners technology has been employed.  Since it is largely a digression from the main topic of this paper, the description is necessarily brief.  However, the Groveler s need for active inconspicuity is what motivated the development of MS Manners, and it is currently the only substantive application in which the technology has been incorporated and tested.  In future sections of this paper, we occasionally refer to aspects of this example application to lend concreteness to what might otherwise be overly abstract descriptions. The broad application context is SIS [Bolosky 99], a single-instance store implemented in the Microsoft  Windows  NT operating system [Solomon 98] on top of the NTFS file system [Custer 94].  SIS is a mechanism for reducing disk-space requirements by eliminating duplicate files.  Each file that is found to be identical to another is replaced by a link to a common-store file, and only the common-store file contains the actual contents of the original files. The SIS mechanism comprises two components, one of which is a file-system filter driver that passively intercepts I/O operations directed to link files and redirects them to the appropriate common-store files.  The other component is a system service called the Groveler.  The Groveler actively searches for identical files on each disk volume and, whenever it finds any, makes a call to the SIS filter driver to combine the duplicate files into a single file. The Groveler maintains a database of information about all files on the disk volume, including the size of each file and a signature of the file contents.  Periodically, it scans the file system s USN journal, which is a dynamically updated log in which the operating system records all I/O activity that changes the contents of the file system.  The Groveler puts any new or modified files on a work queue.  Initially   and if and when the USN journal overflows   the Groveler traverses the entire directory tree using a depth-first search, putting every eligible file onto the work queue. The main operations of the Groveler are to remove each file from the work queue, to compute the file s signature, to query the database for files with matching size and signature, to compare the contents of the file to that of any files whose size and signature match, and if an identical file is found, to call down to the SIS filter driver to merge the duplicate files.  The Groveler is a single process, but it has a separate work queue and separate threads for each disk volume. To avoid a performance impact on other processes via pollution of the disk buffer cache, all file reads are non-cached.  To avoid interfering with foreground processes by causing lock conflicts, exclusive file access is maintained only through opportunistic locks, which are automatically released when another process requests access to the file. This application has all the properties of an ideal candidate for active inconspicuity:  Its function is a type of housekeeping, in that the results of its operation are not directly visible to the user.  Completing the work eventually is important, because otherwise duplicate files would persist, causing the disk space to fill up more quickly than necessary.  However, there is usually no rush to complete the work, unless free disk space is in extremely short supply.  And since the performance of the application is I/O bound, priority-based scheduling is insufficient to keep the process completely in the background. MS Manners Architecture MS Manners is an application library that provides a programming interface to support active inconspicuity through monitoring and control of background programs.  Although the introduction to this paper described regulating the execution of a background process, the MS Manners system actually provides a finer level of control than this.  The unit of execution that is regulated is the  task,  of which there may be more than one per process.  For example, in the SIS Groveler, there are two tasks per disk partition, one for moving files from the USN journal to the work queue, which we will refer to as the  extraction task,  and one for all other operations on the partition, which we will refer to as the  groveling task.   MS Manners controls the activity of a process by separately throttling individual tasks. The execution of each task is quantized into time slices.  Each task is permitted to execute for a brief period of real time, at the end of which it reports to MS Manners performance data about the work it completed during that time slice.  The data is reported in a generic fashion that does not require MS Manners to know what resources are being used.  After it makes this report, the task blocks, waiting for MS Manners to authorize it to proceed.  Although a single task may contain multiple threads in order to maintain multiple contexts, only one thread is permitted to proceed at a time, in order to prevent threads from affecting each other s performance measurements.  For example, in the Groveler, there is one thread for dequeueing and processing files for a partition, and another thread for traversing the directory tree and enqueueing files, but both threads comprise the single groveling task.  Task execution alternates between the two threads so as to maintain an approximately constant work queue depth. MS Manners calculates the task s performance according to the returned data, compares this performance to a target performance value, and if the actual performance is at least as good as the target, then the task is permitted to proceed for another time slice, after an optional delay to limit the working rate of the task.  If the task s performance is worse than the target, then the task is throttled by suspending it for a period of time, after which it is allowed another time slice in which to operate and to make another set of measurements.  The task s execution is not stopped entirely, or else there would be no way to determine when it is acceptable to continue. While a task is throttled, the suspension time between execution slices grows exponentially, up to a set limit, in a manner similar to the binary exponential back-off used in Ethernet [Metcalfe 76].  The exponential increase makes the background task adjust to the time scale of the foreground execution patterns, providing relatively fast background process resumption following short periods of foreground activity, but limiting the impact of the background task s execution probes during long periods of foreground activity.  The limit on time between slices of execution places a bound on the worst-case background task resumption time.  When a set of measurements indicates that a throttled task s performance has returned to within the target range, then the throttling is removed, and the next suspension time for the task is reset to its starting value. If the work of a background task becomes more critical, MS Manners permits the execution of the task to become more aggressive, by decreasing the limit on the task suspension time, which increases the task s duty cycle while it is suspended.  In the SIS Groveler, groveling the files of each disk partition becomes more important as the amount of free space on the partition becomes low relative to the amount of space that can be freed by merging the duplicate files in the queue.  As the free disk space approaches zero, the limit on the task suspension time approaches the working delay interval. It may not be necessary for all tasks of a background process to be throttled.  For instance, any task that is CPU-bound may be held sufficiently in the background by scheduling priority.  Alternately, if a task executes with a very low duty cycle, then its impact on the performance of other processes may be very small, even if it is I/O-intensive during its active periods.  In the SIS Groveler, an example of the latter is the extraction task, which extracts log entries from the file system s USN journal and enters items into the work queue.  Throttling this task could cause the USN journal to overflow during periods of heavy file-system activity, in which case it would be necessary to rescan the entire disk volume to avoid missing any file updates, thereby increasing the Groveler s workload.  For this reason, the extraction task is not throttled.  Instead, its execution frequency is dynamically adjusted to maintain a fixed count of extracted USN entries per work queue update, so its duty cycle actually increases during periods of heavy file-system activity.  This behavior is acceptable since measured duty cycles for the log extractor are under 2% even during periods of heavy disk updating, as detailed in Section 8. Background processes that employ MS Manners may also employ idle scheduling priority, in order to directly avoid CPU conflicts with foreground processes.  In the SIS Groveler, the groveling task runs at idle priority; however, the extraction task does not, for the same reason that it is not throttled. Multiple Tasks A single process may contain more than one background task.  The main complication introduced by multiple tasks is that, if they use a common resource, then the operation of one task might interfere with the performance of another task, leading the latter to incorrectly suspend its operation.  Collisions of this sort in a system employing binary exponential back-off can lead to unfairness [Ramakrishnan 94] or instability [Rosenkrantz 84, Goodman 88].  In a worst case, two or more background tasks could mutually interfere continuously, driving each other into their maximally suspended states even if there are no foreground processes in execution. MS Manners employs the obvious solution to this problem, which is to let only one task execute at a time.  This solution is trivial to implement, but it raises the issue of how to determine which task to run next.  Here again we take the obvious approach, which is to establish relative priorities for the tasks.  Our approach falls generally under the rubric of decay usage scheduling [Hellerstein 93]. Each task provides a value that indicates its current priority, known as its instantaneous task priority.  This value ranges from zero, indicating maximal priority, to one, indicating minimal priority.  From each task s instantaneous task priority, MS Manners calculates an effective task priority by means of the following formula: effective task priority  =  instantaneous task priority ( (task duty cycle + () The task duty cycle is calculated as the fraction of recent real time that the task has been permitted to execute, exponentially averaged over a period determined by a settable time constant.  ( is a small positive value, ensuring that only a zero instantaneous task priority can yield a zero effective task priority.  Of those tasks that are ready to execute, the one with the smallest value of effective task priority is permitted to execute next.  Thus, each task is permitted to execute for a portion of real time that is inversely proportional to the value of its instantaneous task priority. Task priority has relevance only when two or more tasks are ready to work at the same time, so tasks that are throttled or that have naturally low duty cycles won t interfere significantly with other tasks, even if the priorities of the former are high.  In particular, since tasks with instantaneous task priority of zero are not guaranteed to be time-balance scheduled by the above priority formula, it is important that such tasks execute infrequently enough to prevent each other s starvation. As an example of how tasks might establish priority values, each groveling task of the SIS Groveler calculates its priority according to the following formula: instantaneous task priority  =  partition s free disk space / total free disk space + ( Thus, each groveling task has a duty cycle that is inversely proportional to its partition s share of the total free disk space in the system.  At the extreme, a partition with no free disk space has a groveling task with an instantaneous task priority of (, making it higher priority than all other tasks except those with zero instantaneous task priority. The above mechanism can be extended to apply to background tasks within separate processes.  At present, multiple-process support is not implemented in MS Manners, but the remainder of this section summarizes our current ideas and the directions we intend to explore.* We see two main issues that make multiple-process active inconspicuity differ from a completely transparent extension of multiple-task active inconspicuity.  Clearly, the above arguments for allowing only one task to execute at a time remain valid when those tasks are in separate processes, so the first issue concerns whether the tasks of one process should be scheduled on par with tasks in another process, as threads of different processes are scheduled on the CPU [Custer 93].  The alternative is to schedule the processes on par with each other and then to schedule the tasks of each process separately.  The disadvantage of the former approach is that it preferentially performs the work of processes that create more tasks over the work of those that create fewer tasks, which has the undesired effect of placing a de facto process-priority constraint on the selection of the task structure of a background application. To avoid involuntarily coupling a process s implicit priority to its task structure, we propose prioritizing the processes separately from the tasks within the processes.  This approach has the additional benefit of making it easier to address the second issue, which is how different and unrelated processes should determine their relative priority, when their designers have no knowledge of what purpose other background applications may be serving. There may be no ideal solution to this second issue, but we intend to follow an approach used in some networking environments [H ndel 91], in which each agent may lower its own priority below, but not raise it above, the normal level of priority.  The philosophy underlying this design is that, although a process cannot be trusted to know whether its execution is more important than that of any other process, it can be trusted to know whether its execution is currently less important than it usually is.  Thus, each process will provide an instantaneous process priority, which ranges from one, indicating normal priority, to zero, indicating minimal priority.  This convention is backwards from that of the task priority, but each was chosen to make sense in its own context. From each process s instantaneous process priority, MS Manners will calculate an effective process priority by means of the following formula: effective process priority  =  instantaneous process priority ( (1   process duty cycle) The process duty cycle is analogous to the task duty cycle described above, exponentially averaging the fraction of recent real time that the process has been permitted to execute.  Of those processes that are ready to execute a task, the one with the highest effective process priority is permitted to execute next, so each normal-priority process will be granted an equal share of real time in which to execute, and lower priority processes will receive proportionally reduced shares of execution time. In addition to the above issues of policy, there are important practical problems to solve for inter-process task synchronization to work correctly, efficiently, and reliably.  In particular, unless there is a central system service that coordinates the background processes, there will be need for a distributed selection algorithm that enables the background processes to collectively determine which one should execute next.  Also, since any process can inappropriately terminate at any time, there is need for a fault-recovery system to prevent the failure of one background process from halting the execution of another, and if there is no central coordinator, this fault-recovery system also needs to be distributed.  Our research in these areas is still in progress. Statistical Mechanism When a task completes a slice of execution, it reports back a set of performance data indicating the measured speed of its operations.  If the speed of each operation were deterministic, depending only upon the load on the system resources used by the operation, then comparing the measured performance to a target performance would be straightforward.  However, I/O operation times can be highly variable even on an unloaded system [Worthington 95, Hillyer 96], and performance measurements are subject to errors due to clock granularity, so a direct comparison with a target is susceptible to false triggering.  Therefore, MS Manners employs a statistical comparison technique to cope with the stochastic fluctuations in performance measurements. Each task reports its performance data as a list of triples, corresponding to types of operations performed by the task.  Each triple contains a count of the number of operations performed during the time slice, the total real time taken for the operations to complete, and an optional parameter that represents the relative amount of work performed by each operation.  The set of operations for each task is statically established prior to the regulated execution of the task, and operations may be common across tasks.  In the specific case of the SIS Groveler, the performance of the process is dominated by disk reads, so this is the only type of operation defined; the parameter is the amount of data read.  More generally, an operation can be any action or set of actions that consumes a sufficient amount of real time to be readily measurable.  Operations that are CPU intensive will exhibit performance that is sensitive to contention for processor cycles and processor cache; operations that are memory intensive will exhibit performance that is sensitive to contention for memory capacity and memory bandwidth; etc.  It is not necessary for either MS Manners or the application to know exactly what resources are used by an operation. For each operation type, the operation time is computed as the total consumed time divided by the operation count.  This value is then compared against a target value using a paired-sample sign test [Freund 92], which is a distribution-free, non-parametric, statistical comparison test.  As mentioned above, we use a statistical test because we are dealing with stochastic operations.  We use a non-parametric test because we have no guarantee that the assumptions required for parametric tests are valid for all operational performance data.  We use a distribution-free test because of its exceptional robustness given the arbitrary probability distributions underlying the stochastic behavior of the tasks  operations.  We use a paired-sample sign test in particular because it enables us to combine the measurements from multiple operations into a single statistical test. The paired-sample sign test compares each sample with a corresponding target value and counts the total number of samples that are greater than their target values.  Each target value is a function of the operation type and the optional work parameter.  To take advantage of more information as it becomes available, the sample size increases linearly with each test, up to a set limit to bound the computational and storage requirements of the test. The result of the set of comparisons can be expressed as an ordered pair (n, r), where n is the sample set size, and r is the count of samples that are greater than the target value.  If r is greater than a threshold value that is a function of both n and a pre-defined type-I error probability (, then the performance is judged to be degraded.  If r is less than a different threshold value that is a function of both n and a pre-defined type-II error probability (, then the performance is judged to be normal.  If r falls between the two threshold values, then the performance judgement is deferred. The action that MS Manners takes with respect to a task depends upon which of the three performance judgements results from the comparison test.  If the performance is judged to be degraded, suggesting that the task is effecting a corresponding degradation on another process, then the task is suspended for a period of time that doubles each time the comparison returns a degraded result, up to a set limit.  If the performance judgement is deferred, then the task is permitted to execute for another time slice, allowing it to gather more measurement data from which to make a better judgement in the future.  If the performance is judged to be normal, then not only is the task permitted to execute for another time slice, but also the suspension time is reset to its initial value. Automatic Calibration MS Manners determines whether the performance of a background task is normal or degraded by comparing the measured performance of the task to a target value.  This target is determined by an automatic calibration procedure that operates in tandem with the comparison procedure.  The same performance data that is used to determine the current task performance is also conditionally subsampled, statistically abstracted, and temporally filtered to determine the target task performance. For operations that perform a constant amount of work, the measure of the target performance is the quiescent operation time, which is the time to perform the operation on an unloaded resource.  For operations that perform a variable amount of work, the time to perform each operation is assumed to correlate linearly with the quantity of work completed, so the measure of the target performance is a line that represents the quiescent operation time as a function of the work parameter.  Note that the former abstraction is merely a special case of the latter, in which the performance line is parallel to the x-axis. We will defer a discussion of the first step, conditional subsampling, for last, where its purpose will be more clear.  The second step is statistical abstraction, which produces a quantified measure of the target performance from the sampled performance measurements.  As mentioned above, this measure is a linear equation that relates the operation time to a work parameter.  The coefficients of the equation are obtained through least-squares linear regression [Freund 92], where the independent variable x is the work parameter, and the dependent variable y is the operation time.  The six sufficient statistics for linear regression, (x, (y, (xx, (yy, (xy, and n, are maintained persistently, so the performance target does not need to be re-calibrated from scratch each time the process is executed. The quiescent performance of an operation may change over time; for example, the performance characteristics of file systems change as successive iterations of writes cause files to fragment [Smith 97].  Because MS Manners relies on having reasonably accurate estimates of target performance for its throttling decisions, target values based upon stale measurement data could lead to over- or under-aggressive execution of background tasks.  To avoid this undesirable situation, MS Manners ages out old performance data by means of temporal filtering, which is the final step in the calibration procedure.  Strictly speaking, this filtering is not a separate step but rather is integral to the statistical abstraction.  Each time a sample is taken, the sufficient statistics are updated according to the following rules: (x  (  ( ( (x + x (y  (  ( ( (y + y (xx  (  ( ( (xx + x2 (yy  (  ( ( (yy + y2 (xy  (  ( ( (xy + x ( y n  (  ( ( n + 1 When 0 < ( < 1, these rules effect an exponential averaging of the regression state. Repeated application of the exponential-averaging update rule for n will cause it to asymptotically approach a constant value n( given by the following equation:  EMBED Equation.3   Thus, the effective steady-state sample size is n(.  To initialize the regression, MS Manners collects some number n(( of samples, weights them by the ratio n(/n((, and calculates the sufficient statistics with ( = 1.  Since it has no target performance values until after these n(( samples are collected, it does not attempt to dynamically regulate the execution of the task during this initialization phase.  Instead, it allows the task to execute at a special calibration rate that is both lower than the normal working rate, so as to reduce the performance impact of the task on the system, and higher than the suspension rate, so as to complete the initialization phase within a reasonable period of time. The exponential averaging of target performance is clocked by the rate at which samples are taken, rather than by the passage of time.  Since measurements of degraded performance cause execution to back off, fewer such measurements will be made per unit time than will measurements of normal performance, so this mechanism will tend to capture values that reflect normal performance in preference to those that reflect degraded performance.  However, the execution rate of a task also increases as its work becomes more critical, even if its performance is degraded.  Under these circumstances, MS Manners subsamples the measurement data so as to consider only the number of samples that would have been taken if the maximum suspension rate had not been so reduced.  This is the first step of the calibration procedure. Since the lack of target performance data is all that prevents MS Manners from throttling a task during initial calibration, the completion of the initial data collection is sufficient to allow throttling to begin.  However, there is no guarantee that the initial performance measurements were made during a time of relatively low system activity, so it is possible that subsequent performance that appears normal, by virtue of its comparison to the initially calibrated target, is actually degraded, in which case MS Manners would fail to throttle the task properly.  In fact, there is never a guarantee that measured performance will reflect quiescent performance, because any system resource can conceivably remain loaded forever.  However, calibrating over a longer time increases the likelihood of encountering an idle period and thus of obtaining accurate measurements of quiescent performance.  For this reason, following the initialization phase is a probationary period during which, although the execution rate is permitted to drop as low as the suspension rate when the performance is judged to be degraded, it is not permitted to exceed the calibration rate even when the performance is judged to be normal, since this latter judgement is suspect. Configuration Parameters Several parameters control aspects of background task execution.  These parameters have reasonable default values that need not be changed, but they are available to the application designer in the event that other values are considered more appropriate.  Most parameters represent trade-offs between several desiderata, and individual applications may differ in their relative appraisals of these trade-offs.  With the exception of the error probabilities used in the statistical comparison test, it is straightforward to determine appropriate values for these parameters from the desired properties of the background process. Each task determines the length of its own execution time slice.  By making the time slice shorter, the task increases the promptness with which it can be suspended; however, the time slice must be long enough to efficiently amortize the overhead of the throttling mechanism.  Also, tasks that perform operations with relatively long completion times will require comparably long time slices.  In the SIS Groveler, the time slices for the groveling task are on the order of 200 ms. Working rate defaults to unity, but this can be reduced in order to limit the maximum possible performance interference of the background task on a foreground process. Base suspension time defaults to 5 seconds.  Larger values delay the task longer before retrying, for more conservative behavior.  Smaller values permit more rapid resumption of task execution following a falsely triggered suspension. Smaller values of maximum suspension time reduce the worst-case time to resume a background task after a period of foreground activity has completed.  Larger values reduce the steady-state impact of a suspended task on a foreground process.  The default value of 5 minutes should keep the steady-state impact well below one percent for the time slice durations of most processes. The steady-state calibration sample size n( and the initial calibration sample size n(( should be set large enough to smooth out short-term variations in operation performance.  The first of these values is used to calculate ( via equation 5, so it also determines the time constants of the calibration system.  Performance measurements that indicate normal performance will be sampled at the working rate, so multiplying n( by the time slice duration yields the time constant for improved performance.  The time constant for deteriorated performance is greater than this in proportion to the ratio of the suspension rate to the working rate.  For the SIS Groveler, n( is set to 5000 and n(( is set to 1000, which for the 200-ms time slice and 5-minute maximum suspension time yield a performance-increase time constant of 17 minutes and a performance-decrease time constant of 17 days.  This latter value may seem quite large, but it is reasonable if no substantial and sustained decrease in disk performance is expected over a shorter period. The calibration rate is generally set to a value between the suspension rate and the normal working rate.  The higher the rate, the sooner the system will collect enough measurement samples to begin regulated execution.  The lower the rate, the lower the performance impact on any foreground processes that may be running during target initialization.  The default value is one time slice of execution per second, which for a 200-ms time slice limits the duty cycle of the background task to 20%.  For an n(( of 1000, this calibration rate will initialize the target performance in 3.3 minutes. The probation period can be set to virtually any duration, including zero.  The trade-off is that a shorter period increases the danger of a negative impact on system performance due to an incorrectly calibrated target, whereas a longer period postpones the start of working at the maximal rate.  The default value for this parameter is 24 hours, so as to include any comparatively quiescent periods in a diurnally cyclical load. The task duty cycle time constant determines the period over which weighted fairness among tasks is maintained.  By default, this is set to 5 minutes, to coincide with the default value of maximum suspension time. The sign-test sample-size limit places a bound on the computational and storage requirements of the comparison test, although in practice, the storage requirement is trivial.  In the current implementation, this value can be no larger than 20, because beyond this, calculation of the threshold values from the binomial distribution would overflow 64-bit integers.  Empirically, we have observed that increasing the sample size beyond 10 does not appreciably affect the results of the comparison procedure, so that is the default value. The most interesting parameters are the two error probabilities, ( and (, that govern the sensitivity of the statistical comparison test.  The selection of these parameters is driven by three competing considerations:  1) Increasing the value of ( allows faster reaction to degraded performance; 2) increasing ( relative to ( improves the stability of background execution; and 3) decreasing ( reduces the performance impact on foreground processes. A minimum number of samples must be collected before degraded performance can be recognized by the paired-sample sign test.  This minimum sample size increases with decreasing values of (.  For the paired-sample sign test, the relationship between ( and minimum sample size m is quantized negative logarithmic:  EMBED Equation.3   Therefore, a minimum of m performance measurements must be made before the performance can be judged to be degraded and the background task thereby suspended.  Since it is desirable to suspend the performance quickly when interference with a foreground process is detected, m should be small, and therefore ( should be large. By definition, ( is the probability that normal performance will be judged incorrectly to be degraded.  At the extreme value of ( = 1, the performance is always judged to be degraded, irrespective of any measurement.  The suspension time grows exponentially with each judgement of degradation, and it is reset to its initial value with a judgement of normalcy.  Thus, during times of normal performance, the task suspension state is a birth-death system that is isomorphic to a bulk-service queue [Kleinrock 75] of infinite group size with an arrival rate of ( and a bulk service rate of (.  Therefore, under the assumption that timing measurements exhibit no low-order serial correlation apart from that due to load, the steady-state probability that exactly k judgements of degradation have occurred since the most recent judgement of normalcy is given by:  EMBED Equation.3   When the next judgement of degradation occurs, which it will after a minimum of m time slices with a probability of (, the suspension time will be 2k times the base suspension time d, where d is expressed as a multiple of the task s mean time slice.  Thus, the mean steady-state inactive time relative to the working time is:  EMBED Equation.3   Clearly, for this system to be stable requires ( < (.  Increasing ( relative to ( increases the duty cycle of the background task during periods without foreground activity.  Note that this analysis is only valid for serially uncorrelated measurements; since successive judgements of degradation geometrically increase the suspension time, but successive judgements of normalcy are idempotent, any low-order serial correlation present in the performance measurements will further decrease the stability. It is not easy to determine the probability that degraded performance will be judged incorrectly to be normal, because it depends upon the degree of degradation, the specific distribution of operation times at a given resource load, the measurement sample count, and the value of (, the latter of which equals the probability that performance degraded by a vanishingly small degree will be judged incorrectly to be normal.  For an operation whose timing is weakly stochastic (meaning that the standard deviation is very small relative to the mean), ( can be fairly large without a significant likelihood of misjudging degraded performance.  However, for an operation whose timing is strongly stochastic, it is important to keep the value of ( relatively small so as to prevent excessive background execution during periods of foreground activity. Given these conflicting considerations and our inevitable ignorance of the distribution and serial correlation of the operation times, we have selected default values of ( = 0.05 and ( = 0.2 on the modest premise that they appear intuitively reasonable.  With these values, m = 5, which for a 200-ms time slice yields a minimum reaction time of 1 second.  A base suspension time of 5 seconds means d = 25, so we expect a background performance penalty of q = 0.33, if successive timing measurements are uncorrelated.  Empirically, these parameter values demonstrate a prompt reaction to foreground activity, a moderately stable background state, and a fairly low impact on foreground processing in the presence of highly stochastic operation timing, as detailed in the following section. Performance Measurements Performance measurements were made using the SIS Groveler, described in Section 2, as the background process.  Our test machine is a Pentium  II 266-MHz personal computer with 64 MB of RAM, a PCI bus, and an Adaptec  2940UW SCSI controller connected to a Seagate  ST34371W disk drive and a Plextor  PX-12TS CD-ROM drive.  The operating system is an interim developers release (build 1802) of Windows  NT 5.0, since this is the only OS on which the SIS Groveler runs. Before describing our performance tests, we first present some measurements that indicate the difficulty of the problem we are trying to solve.  Figure 5 shows a histogram, with 1-ms bins, of the times for 16-kB reads by the SIS Groveler on an unloaded system.  The mean value of this distribution is 20.3 ms, and the standard deviation is 4.7 ms, so the operation times are quite stochastic.  Figure 6 shows a histogram of the times for 16-kB reads on a system that is simultaneously executing another disk-intensive process, as described below.  The mean value is 30.3 ms, and the standard deviation is 11.1 ms.  Although the mean value of the latter distribution is 49% greater than that of the former, over 18% of  the latter read times are less than the former mean value, and 42% of each distribution s area overlaps with the other s.  With a sufficient number of samples, it is easy to determine whether the system resource is under contention; however, our challenge is to make such a determination with few enough samples to avoid excessive impact on the foreground process. We tested the performance impact of the SIS Groveler on an I/O-bound foreground process, namely Microsoft  Office 97 Professional Setup, which installs 142 MB of data in 1144 files to the local disk from its distribution CD.  We performed a complete installation except for the Find Fast component, which begins scanning the disk immediately after setup is complete and thereby interferes with our performance measurements.  We verified that this is a strongly I/O-bound process by measuring the CPU load over the unattended portion of the setup procedure as 19.1% ( 2.2% when no other processes   aside from system processes   were running.  Our measure of the performance of this foreground application is the elapsed time, as measured by a stopwatch, from clicking the  Continue  button on the final configuration dialog box to the display of the message box indicating setup completion. The SIS Groveler was provided with a fixed workload of two identical directory trees to scan, each containing 200 MB of data in 1308 files spanning 395 directories.  In order to keep the Groveler s workload constant across all tests, the files installed by Office Setup were excluded from groveling.  We allowed MS Manners to establish performance target values by running the SIS Groveler on an idle system through this fixed workload until the initial calibration phase was completed.  We set the probation period to zero, so that normal operation would immediately commence.  For the experiments, we measured the elapsed time, via stopwatch, from the initiation of the groveling operation to the point at which the work queue is drained. We tested three different versions of the Groveler, one in which the service runs as a normal process, one in which it runs at idle priority, and one in which it runs at normal priority with the MS Manners technology active.  For each version, we ran two different tests, one in which the Groveler runs on a system with no foreground activity, and one in which Office Setup was started 30 seconds after the Groveler was started.  In addition to these six tests, we ran a control in which only Office Setup was run.  For each test, we performed five trials.  The results of these tests are shown in Figures 7, 8, and 9. Figure 7 illustrates our main result, the performance impact of a background process on a foreground process, as indicated by the time to complete Office Setup under four different scenarios.  The gray portion at the top of each column indicates the observed variation among the timing of the five trials for the associated test.  When no other non-system process is executing, Office Setup takes a mean time of 251 seconds to complete.  When the SIS Groveler is running as a normal (unregulated) process, contention for system resources increases the mean execution time of Office Setup by 95% to 482 seconds.  When the Groveler runs at idle priority, the effect is insignificant: a mean completion time of 491 seconds.  With MS Manners activated, the mean execution time of Office Setup is 280 seconds, which is merely 11% greater than the mean execution time when the Groveler is not running at all. Figure 8 illustrates the effect of the MS Manners technology on a background process when no foreground process is running.  When the Groveler is running as a normal process, it takes a mean time of 415 seconds to complete its workload.  Running at idle priority changes the mean execution time insignificantly to 412 seconds.  When MS Manners is enabled, the execution time lengthens to a mean of 483 seconds, which is an increase of 16%.  Recall that the predicted performance penalty from employing MS Manners with the given configuration parameters is 33%, so the actual measured value is not at all disappointing. Figure 9 illustrates the effect of Office Setup on the performance of the SIS Groveler.  When the Groveler is run as a normal process, its mean execution time is 683 seconds; when it is run as an idle-priority process, its mean execution time is 692 seconds; and when it is run with MS Manners enabled, its mean execution time is 785 seconds.  These times are respectively 2.4%, 4.3%, and 6.9% greater than the corresponding sums of the mean execution times of Office Setup and the SIS Groveler when run separately.  However, according to a Mann-Whitney test [Freund 92] at a significance level of 0.05, only the idle-priority difference is significant.  Thus, we draw no conclusions from these comparisons. Figure 10 illustrates the dynamic behavior of a process governed by MS Manners, taken from a representative trial of the SIS Groveler with Office Setup running in the foreground.  The x-axis is running time from the beginning of the Groveler s execution; the y-axis is duty cycle, measured as the fraction of real time that the groveling task is permitted to execute by MS Manners.  Office Setup is initiated after 30 seconds of groveling, and the setup process runs for 278 seconds.  During the time that the Groveler is running without any foreground activity, its duty cycle averages 80.4%; during the time that it is sharing use of the CPU and disk with Office Setup, its duty cycle averages 12.3%.  The exponential back-off behavior is clearly visible in the trace, as are several restarts (such as the large one at around 200 on the x-axis) where MS Manners incorrectly concluded that no foreground activity was present. The log extraction task of the Groveler is not throttled in any manner, in order to avoid overflowing the USN journal during periods of heavy file-system activity.  To verify that this is an acceptable practice, we performed a test of executing Office Setup while the groveling task was completely suspended, but the log extractor was permitted to process files from the directories into which the setup program was installing files.  We then measured the duty cycle of the log extractor during the execution of Office Setup, and found it to average 1.8% ( 0.1%.  Strictly speaking, this result has no bearing on the design of MS Manners itself, but it does validate a design decision in the manner of incorporating MS Manners into the SIS Groveler. To study the long-term behavior of the automatic calibration mechanism, we generated an intensive foreground disk load using a dummy application that traverses a directory tree and reads data from each file it encounters.  While this foreground application is executing, the mean background read time for a 4-kB disk read was measured as 34.0 ms, as compared to a measured quiescent read time of 9.5 ms. We simulated a diurnally cyclical pattern of system activity by alternating execution of the foreground application with sleeping, over an interval of 30 minutes, with a duty cycle determined by the following formula, where the time t is expressed in days, and ( is the mean disk load over each day:  EMBED Equation.3   To illustrate a worst case, we started the calibration during a period of maximum disk load, so the initial value for the target read time incorrectly represents heavily loaded performance.  We set ( = 0.8. In Figure 11, the initial target read time is computed as 34.0 ms, which is 258% over its ideal value.  After 12 hours, the foreground disk load reaches a minimum of zero, by which point the target value has dropped to 17.8 ms.  Even after the load begins rising, the target continues to drop for another 7.5 hours, until it reaches a local minimum of 13.1 ms.  It then rises slowly, in response to an increase in measured read time that MS Manners interprets as a sustained decrease in resource performance.  The probation period ends after 24 hours, after which the duty cycle of the background process is permitted to reach its specified working rate, in this case unity.  Also at this point, the foreground disk load reaches a maximum of unity, but the high level of disk usage continues to draw the target upward for another four hours, until it reaches a local maximum of 15.1 ms, which is 59% over the ideal target value.  After 36 hours have elapsed, the target value fluctuates cyclically between 10.0 ms and 13.2 ms, with a mean of 10.8 ms, which is 13% over the ideal value. Related Work MS Manners temporarily suspends background tasks to prevent interference with the performance of foreground processes.  Tadamura and Nakamae [Tadamura 97] developed a similar technology for a similar purpose.  The motivation for their work was not concern about non-CPU resource contention but rather the lack of strict scheduling priority in the flavor of Unix under which their processes were executing.  Their solution involves automatically classifying processes according to process name, logon name, CPU time, and idle time.  They then suspend processes that are classified as background jobs whenever a process that is classified as a foreground job is found in the system process queue. Stealth [Krueger 91] is a process scheduler that prioritizes not only CPU but also virtual memory and file system cache.  In the domain of a workstation-based distributed system, the goal was to prevent a foreign process from interfering with the performance of a workstation owner s process, which is closely analogous with preventing a background process from interfering with the performance of a foreground process.  The implementation of this system required changes to kernel code, and the prioritization techniques are specific to the two types of resources considered. Resource kernels [Rajkumar 98] schedule multiple system resources   such as CPU, disk bandwidth, network bandwidth, communication buffers, and virtual memory   among concurrent processes.  Since their domain is real-time systems, the requirements on resource access are far stricter than our modest goals of minimizing the interference of one class of processes on another.  All processes must make explicit reservations for any resource they intend to use, and actual resource usage is monitored and enforced by the kernel. Wirth [Wirth 96] suggests an alternative model for multiprocessing in which higher priority tasks interrupt lower priority tasks and then run to completion, unless interrupted by a task of yet higher priority.  Such a model reduces throughput and efficiency relative to the standard multithreading model, but it does prevent lower-priority processes from interfering in any way with the performance of a higher-priority process. MS Manners employs a priority scheme to determine which task should execute when multiple tasks are ready.  Our approach is similar to the common operating-system mechanism of multilevel feedback queue scheduling [Silberschatz 94], but it draws more inspiration from network packet scheduling algorithms such as weighted fair queueing [Demers 90], class-based queueing [Floyd 95], and deficit round robin [Shreedhar 96]. One of the primary strengths of MS Manners is its ability to automatically calibrate its performance targets, which not only frees the application designer from the tedious process of manual tuning but also enables the target to dynamically track sustained changes in system performance over time.  Andersen [Andersen 94] investigated the automatic tuning of CPU scheduling algorithms using optimization by simulated evolution, although he concluded that this tuning was too computationally intensive to be performed in real time. The COMFORT project [Weikum 94] investigated automatically tuning the configuration and operational parameters of a database system to improve performance.  They implemented a control system that dynamically adjusts the multi-programming level to avoid thrashing due to lock conflicts, and they implemented a self-tuning memory manager to exploit inter-transaction locality of reference. VINO [Seltzer 97] is an extensible operating system that employs self-monitoring, data correlation, and in situ simulation to estimate the effects of policy changes.  The changes are proposed by heuristics that attempt to minimize the performance degradation from such causes as paging, disk wait, poor code layout, interrupt latency, and lock contention. MS Manners employs exponential averaging of sufficient statistics in its target calibration.  This is a common technique, used in various contexts by, for example, Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen [Spiegelhalter 90] and Nowlan [Nowlan 91]. Summary and Conclusions Processes that perform housekeeping tasks are generally expected to run in the background, meaning that they should not interfere with normal foreground processes that perform tasks of immediate consequence to the user.  Typically, such processes are assigned an extremely low CPU-scheduling priority in order to limit their execution while normal-priority processes are active.  However, some common background tasks are not CPU-bound, so their execution may not be sufficiently regulated by scheduling priority, especially if a foreground process on the system is performance-bound by the same resources as a background task. Rather than relying on the passive mechanism of scheduling priority, we propose that a background process actively remain inconspicuous by monitoring its own progress and suspending itself when it determines that its performance is degraded, since performance degradation due to resource contention is likely to be mutual.  We have developed a technology, called MS Manners, that performs this monitoring and suspension on behalf of a process.  MS Manners employs a statistical mechanism to deal with the stochastic nature of performance measurements, and it automatically calibrates its performance targets.  Furthermore, it is not necessary for the background task to know exactly what system resources it uses. MS Manners has been incorporated into one real application, and measurements indicate that it reduces the performance impact on a foreground process from 95% to a mere 11%, even in the presence of highly stochastic timing measurements.  The calibration system has been shown to estimate target performance to 13% of the ideal value on a heavily loaded system.

Background Title _PID_GUIDBackground David Goebel Normal.dot David Goebel Microsoft Word 8.0)pE|Z0 QL8GD aC_fq)pE|Z0 QL8GD aC_fqBackground This specification is an attempt to define the design of the Single Instance Store filter driver intended for use on Windows NT 5.0.  My involvement in this project started with Rob Short requesting that I critique a design already in progress by Bill Bolosky in the research group.  This first draft of a spec is the result of a meeting on 9/11/97 with Bill Bolosky and one the following day with Brian Andrew in the NTFS group.  The resulting design was a vast simplification of the design in progress. For the purpose of this first draft, I will skip details of how the reparse point is created and the structure of the data it contains.  This is primarily because this aspect is less fragile w.r.t. deadlocks, data corruption etc., and also is a new feature of NT and thus outside my immediate area of expertise (for the moment General/Abstract Concepts These general areas of functionality are organized in a somewhat chronological order in terms of what will actually happen. Duplicate File Condensation The purpose of this NT component is to eliminate or minimize resource use (memory, disk, cpu, etc.) that is redundant by virtue of files containing, either completely or mostly, the same data.  The idea here is that data common among several redundant files is actually stored in a single  central store  file.  This central store file is never accessed directly by the user (enforced by ACLs and share access), only by the filter driver.  Each file backed by this central store file is actually a reparse points that specifies the common file.  Each file must have its own unique ACLs, access time, alternate streams, etc.  In addition there are temporal in memory structures (like file locks) that must be maintained on a per file basis regardless of whether its data is stored in a common file.  There are two principal mechanisms for condensation of duplicate files: explicit and scavenger. Explicit In this mechanism a newly created empty file is marked as a duplicate of another file.  If the file is already a reparse point (i.e. a duplicate), its final target is used as the backing file.  This will probably be implemented as an FSCTL. Scangenger The idea here is that a low priority process rummages through same size files looking for duplicates.  This may end up being more a research project though as in most important cases (i.e. remote boot service), a process will know at file create time if it is a duplicate. Copy On Write The term  copy on write  stems from creating a copy of a duplicate file (or parts of a file) when its data content is modified from the common store version of the file.  The architecture allows this to happen on the granularity of NTFS sparse file segments, currently 64k.  The basic concept is that the SIS filter queries from NTFS the sparse extent information of a file (via FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES), and using this information, decides whether to service page faults from either the actual file or the common store file.  When data is actually written to the file, the range is marked as non-sparse.  This is the basic idea, but of course there are a multitude of issues and problems that have to dealt with, and are in the next section. Reads As mentioned above, reads are routed to the correct file based on the contents of the allocation extent information returned from NTFS (i.e. the sparseness).  Also as above, there are many complicated concerns ranging from deadlocks to cache coherency and they will be dealt with in the next section. Supercede/Overwrite  When a file is superceded or completely overwritten, SIS removes the reparse point and decrements a count on the central store, doing garbage collection if necessary. Design Goals File semantics must behave exactly the same as if the file was not backed by a central store. Only eliminating redundant disk usage is not useful.  Redundant memory usage must also be eliminated. SIS should have a negligible performance impact on files not participating in SIS. Central store files should be able to be compressed using NTFS compression. A file s BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.FileIndex should not change during the process of duplicate file condensation or copy on write.  To do so would break NFS clients. Problems (real and potential) Cache Coherency Since we must present an image of completely independent files, but using common pages in the cache, we must intercede before a process writes cached data that would be incorrect to appear in the other files.  Memory mapped files further aggravate this problem as there is no way to intercede before a process dirties a file it has mapped.  This problem fortunately has a solution. Deadlocks Anytime file objects are switched in between a top level request and a recursive request, there is potential to confuse deadlock protection code in the file systems that preemptively acquires resources or changes which resources it acquires based on TopLevelIrp information.  Luckily the design of SIS requires only a single  un-natural  act on a file receiving only non-cached reads and thus the deadlock concerns are, hopefully, eliminated. Interaction With Other Filters This is a nightmare.  In theory a correctly designed filter should inter-operate with other correctly designed filters above the file system and the layering order should be irrelevant, even with all filters operating.  In practice I would bet money that something is going to break, even with just Microsoft s internal filters.  I shutter to thing how it will interact with Symantec s virus filter.  I m going to ignore this problem because it ranges from very hard for Microsoft s filters to intractable for third party filters.  All that can be done is make SIS as correct as possible so that no fingers are pointing at us. Duplicate File Condensation & Supercede/Overwrite m skipping these for the moment as it wasn t why I was originally brought in and doesn t present any of the above problems.  Both operations can happen in a well-controlled steady state.  However, the list of operations that must still be maintained on a per file basis (file offset, ACLs, file locks, etc.) should be investigated and documented here.  Since the calls on this   will basically just be passed through unchanged to NTFS, there is very little risk of problems.  The only problem should be not including everything on the pass through list. Reads & Copy On Writes Nomenclature I often refer to  private  when talking about the files that have reparse points for the duplicate data and non-sparse ranges for their  private  data.  These reparse points refer to a single file in the common store containing the shared data. FO: FileObject FCB: FileControlBlock SOP: SectionObjectPointer DS: DataSection SCM: SharedCacheMap IS: ImageSection FCFH: FsRtlCommonFcbHeader FSC1: FsContext1 FO-cs: Central Store File Object FO-1: User Handle To Private File FO-2: User Handle To Another Private File FO-n: Nth Private Handle And so on Assumptions For this discussion, we assume that we are opening a file that is already backed by a central store.  The processing of getting to this state, while not absolutely trivial, is not plagued by the complex situations arising from copy on write, and will be covered in the previous section (Duplicate File Condensation & Supercede/Overwrite) when it is complete. We assume we are layered on top of all NTFS volumes that want SIS service.  We also use FCFH-> FilterContexts to maintain per file context as the action often happens with file objects others than the ones that opened the file. SIS has a FileObject open for each central store file that has at least one open client file. The Basic Ideas All (except one) redirections happen at the top level when the file system has not yet been entered and it is safe to switch file objects on a request. Sparse ranges in the private file correspond to duplicate data located in the central store file. All writes are sent to the private file (i.e. they are left unchanged), creating a SCM-n or writing to disk, or both. Only cached writes and user mapping files result in a non-NULL DS-n. Only non-cached writes (either user or paging) result in ranges being marked non-sparse. We redirect top-level cached read requests to the central store when there is no data section present on the private file and the range being read is part of the sparse range of the private file (note that a complete duplicate is completely spare and consumes no disk space). We redirect top-level (i.e. user) non-cached reads to the appropriate file depending on the coincidence of the read range and the sparse range.  If there is a DataSection we must first do a coherency flush (guarded by the appropriate Acquire/ReleaseForCcFlush callbacks. We also redirect paging reads to the appropriate file depending on the coincidence of the read range and the sparse range.  This is the single  unnatural act  in SIS as we will possibly be switching the file object between recursive NTFS calls.  As demonstrated below, however, this is analogous to what happens in as a result of the Win32 API CopyFile() and I have great confidence that we will have no problems. MDL read and write requests should  just work  with the above (might have to link together MDL chains and perform multiple completes if spanning sparse regions). When a read or write request overlaps sparse and non-sparse ranges, several requests may have to be performed to satisfy the original request. Non-cached writes smaller than a sparseness clustering that would create a new non-sparse region must be expanded to a sparseness clustering.  Otherwise the gaps would show up as zeros instead of the actual file data. For Synchronous top-level read/writes that get sent to FO-cs, update FileObject->FileOffset in the completion routine if the request is successful.  Rules For the purpose of these rules, I will assume the requests fall either wholly within or outside sparse regions.  The more general case is not really more dangerous, it just has to be done in pieces (an MDL and its COMPLETE call must be to the same file so that the correct resource is released). IRP_MJ_READ, FAST_IO_READ, FAST_IO_MDL_READ, FAST_IO_MDL_READ_COMPLETE, FAST_IO_READ_COMPRESSED, FAST_IO_MDL_READ_COMPLETE_COMPRESSED: if (Cached)     if (DS-N == NULL) && (Range is Sparse) FO = FO-cs;     else FO unchanged; else      if !PagingIo && (DS-N != NULL)         Preacquire; Flush FO; Release     if (Range is Sparse) FO = FO-cs;     else FO unchanged; WRITE IRP_MJ_WRITE, FAST_IO_WRITE, FAST_IO_PREPARE_MDL_WRITE, FAST_IO_MDL_WRITE_COMPLETE, FAST_IO_WRITE_COMPRESSED, FAST_IO_MDL_WRITE_COMPLETE_COMPRESSED FO unchanged if (!Cached) Set Range Non-Sparse Specific Situations User File Mapping When a user maps a file, DS-n becomes non-NULL.  This means all cached reads go to the FO-n.  Coherency is guaranteed between cached readers and mappers as they are looking at the same physical pages.  From this point any faults fill private physical pages but are satisfied from the appropriate file based on the sparseness information.  Coherency is between cached and non-cached is also guaranteed by the coherency flush before inspecting the sparse information.  MDL Reads and Writes These are exclusively cached operations and will follow simply follow the cached operations laid out above.  One caveat here is that when performing muliple operations to span combinations of sparse and non-sparse regions, you must return a single linked MDL to the caller.  When called for Complete, you must split apart the MDL again and call either FO depending on what you did initially, not based on the current state of sparseness nor DS-n.  This is only an issue with read operations as write operations will always go to FO-n. Compressed Files This should  just work  according to Brian.  NTFS compression weirdness is not my forte, so I ll take his word for it and figure it out if it doesn t work.  One thing we did note was that the central store must be compressed if you want compression over the wire (highly desirable for remote boot). Truncating Files When either file size or allocation size if changed NTFS initializes a SCM to avoid other problems (FAT does as well).  This will force all requests to the FCB-n, but not indefinitely.  Extra checks can be done on the read side (zero buffer past ValidDataLength), or truncating could force the file to return to a completely private state.  One of the two must be done. Resource Issues Everything appears OK here.  All cases of writing will go to FCB-n, so the correct resource should be acquired by the lazy writer modified page writer.  The create section resource is concerned with setting file size and that  Benefits Of Sparseness Approach Natural Writing In the absence of the above approach, a file would have to be forced completely private on the first write.  For a large file this could take a long time, altering file semantics and presenting difficult synchronization problems. Efficient Use Of Resources Only those physical pages that are actually different use memory resources.  Mapped files do throw a wrench into this as any pages that are faulted in (either by cached operations or via memory mapped files) can be modified without warning by a mapper, and thus must have separate physical pages.  The only less than perfect aspect here is that if a data section exists simply because of cached writes, cached reads will use new pages.  This is getting really anal, and it would be possible to detect via a callback Mm makes when creating a section. yvpjgd

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8SIS and Backup Title _PID_GUIDSIS and Backup Bill Bolosky Normal Bill Bolosky Microsoft Word 8.0SIS/Backup Interface Bill Bolosky DRAFT April 2, 1999 Introduction SIS is the  Single Instance Store  feature in the Windows NT operating system, version 5.0.  It s primary purpose is to replace duplicate files with copy on write links to a common backing file, and so reduce disk and cache usage for users of duplicate files.  Because SIS replaces the actual file entries with a link, backup applications need to back up the data associated with the files rather than just the link information.  However, backing up the files without realizing that they re links would result in much more space being used on the backup tape than is used on the disk, and could prevent restore from running properly because it would overflow the disk. SIS provides a dynamically linked library that has an interface to backup and restore applications that allows them to back up SIS links and to get the appropriate data along with the file.  This interface is designed in such a way that backup will only put a single copy of any given backing file onto the tape, regardless of how many links to it are backed up.  Furthermore, it makes the contents of the SIS reparse points opaque to the backup and restore applications, so that upgrades to the SIS internals will not require a change in the interface or backup/restore applications, but rather just a new version of the dll. Terminology A SIS file is called a SIS link.  The link consists of a sparse Windows NT 5.0 file system file, probably with most regions of the file unallocated.  It also has a reparse point on it.  The contents of the reparse point is opaque to the backup/restore applications, but the SIS driver and dll understand it.  The reparse point refers to a  backing  file that contains the data for the link.  This backing file is called a common store file.  A given common store file may have one or more links to it. SIS stores all common store files in a special place in the volume called the SIS Common Store or just the common store.  The common store is a directory that is protected against normal user access, and the common store files are never intended to be accessed directly by users.  The contents of a common store file is never changed once it s created, and the names of common store files are globally unique (that is, they are unique across all volumes across all systems in the world).  Thus, the binding between a common store file and its data is global and forever unchanging. The SIS filter driver (also called SIS or the filter) is a Windows NT kernel mode filesystem filter that implements the SIS links.  It runs all the time on SIS-enabled systems.  sisbkup (or the SIS DLL or just the DLL) is the DLL that is the interface between SIS and the backup/restore applications.  It is the subject of this document. In this document I refer to the backup medium as a tape.  This term simply refers to whatever place backup stores its data, and may be a set of tapes, a disk file, or any other medium.  SIS and the DLL make no assumptions about the backup medium save that the same set of files will be available on restore that were backed up onto the medium. The SIS/Backup-Restore API In order to back up and restore SIS links, the backup program needs to be able to tell which files are links to which common store files, and store both the link and the common store file on the tape.  If there is more than one link to a given common store file backed up onto a single tape, there is no need to put more than one copy of the common store file on the tape. When restoring a SIS link the restore application needs to determine to which common store file(s) it refers, and if those file(s) don t exist it needs to restore the file(s) along with the link.  If the link refers to common store file(s) that are still on the disk, then only the link needs to be restored.  Recall that the data in common store files never changes, so if a given common store file is still on the disk at restore time, it has the same contents as when it was backed up and there is no need to overwrite it.  In order to allow backup and restore to do this, SIS provides a dll (sisbkup.dll) that they can use to manage this information without having to understand the contents of SIS reparse points.  This section describes the API to this dll. The API presented here does not make any assumptions about how the backup program stores the necessary information about SIS links, and how it stores the content of the files backing the links.  Rather, it just assumes that backup will back up exactly that set of common store files that the SIS dll requests, and that these common store files will be available when restore runs. One of the goals of this API is that the contents of the SIS reparse points is opaque to the backup/restore application.  This allows the format of the SIS reparse points to change while changing only the dll and not the backup/restore applications.  The reparse points contain a format version identifier, so it will be possible for the dll and driver to handle downlevel reparse points.  Naturally, old versions of the driver/dll won t necessarily be able to handle newer format reparse points, but we expect that new reparse points will only be created with new SIS filter drivers, and that new drivers will come with a new version of sisbkup.dll that understands the new format. The headers for this API are in public\sdk\inc\sisbkup.h. All of the SIS backup/restore operations are volume-local.  That is, if for some reason backup should need to cross volumes during a backup, it will need to call SisCreateBackupStructure for each different volume being backed up, and will need to provide the appropriate sisBackupStructure corresponding to the volume for the file in question in all subsequent calls.  Similar requirements apply to restore. 2.1 SisCreateBackupStructure On backup: BOOL SisCreateBackupStructure( IN PWCHAR volumeRoot, OUT PVOID *sisBackupStructure, OUT PWCHAR *commonStoreRootPathname, OUT PULONG countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp, OUT PWCHAR **commonStoreFilesToBackUp); This call creates an a SIS backup structure, which is used by the SIS dll to keep track of which files are links to which other files on this volume.  This function should be called exactly once for each SIS enabled volume being backed up.  volumeRoot is the Win32 file name of the volume root (without the trailing backslash, ie,. use   not  ) for the volume being backed up.  commonStoreRootPathname returns the fully qualified pathname of the common store for this volume (ie.,  c:\SIS Common Store ).  Any files anywhere under this directory should be treated as common store files for this volume, and only backed up if SIS indicates that they should. The countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp and commonStoreFilesToBackUp parameters together return a list of files that need backing up regardless of which links are backed up.  commonStoreFilesToBackUp is a pointer to an array of filenames.  These files should be backed up at the same time and in the same manner as any common store files requested by SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink.  If countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp is 0, then commonStoreFilesToBackUp may be a NULL pointer and should be ignored. The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. After backup is done with the commonStoreFilesToBackUp array, it needs to free the array and the strings to which it points by calling SisFreeFileNames, which is described in section 2.8. 2.2 SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink BOOL SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink( IN PVOID sisBackupStructure, IN PVOID reparseData, IN ULONG reparseDataSize, IN PVOID  thisFileContext OPTIONAL, OUT PVOID  *matchingFileContext OPTIONAL, OUT PULONG countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp, OUT PWCHAR **commonStoreFilesToBackUp); Backup can identify a SIS reparse point by its tag, which will be IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS, and is defined in sdk\inc\ntioapi.h.  Backup should call SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink exactly once for each SIS link backed up. This function takes as input a pointer to the contents of the SIS reparse point for a link file that backup is planning to put on the tape.  It also takes the length of the reparse data as a parameter as well as a context pointer that is provided by the backup application and uninterpreted by the SIS dll.  If the call succeeds, it will return STATUS_SUCCESS.  If this reparse point represents the first instance of the particular file being backed up, SIS will return NULL as the matching file context and fill in the countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp and commonStoreFilesToBackUp with a array of strings with the names of the common store file(s) to include on the backup tape.  The current version of SIS will always return at most one common store file, but it is possible that in future versions a single link may be backed by an entire set of common store files (say, one for each stream in the file), so backup should support getting multiple files here.  Regardless, each common store file will be returned at most once per backup pass.   When backup is done with the array of filenames and the filenames themselves, it needs to return them to SIS to be freed by calling SisFreeFileNames (see section 2.8). If this is not the first instance of the given common store file being backed up, SIS will fill in matchingFileContext with the thisFileContext that was passed in for the first instance of the file and will set countOfCommonStoreFilesToBackUp to 0.  If there are multiple common store matches for this link, the thisFileContext will correspond to the earliest match with the first common store file returned in the array (that is, commonStoreFilesToBackUp[0]).  The thisFileContext and matchingFileContext parameters are optional, and if they are supplied as NULL the DLL will just ignore them.  When SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink says there are common store file(s) to back up for the link, backup should write out the common store file(s) indicated by the returned filename(s).  Regardless of whether there are common store file(s), backup should back up the file as it actually appears on the disk (ie., as a reparse point and a sparse file, most likely with no regions filled in).  Backup may write out the common store file(s) immediately, postpone backing them up, or mix them together, as is most convenient. The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. 2.3 SisFreeBackupStructure BOOL SisFreeBackupStructure( IN PVOID sisBackupStructure); This call deallocates a SIS volume structure and should be called after backup is done with a particular volume.  Note that it is not safe to assume that this just deallocates memory (ie., the DLL may take some other actions when this is called), so it must be called even if backup is just going to exit immediately afterward. The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. 2.4 SisCreateRestoreStructure As a restore proceeds, when it wishes to restore a SIS link (which may be identified by the reparse tag IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS, found in sdk\inc\ntioapi.h), restore should restore the link from the tape just as it was backed up (ie., as a sparse possibly empty file with a SIS reparse point on it), and then call into the dll to see if it needs to also restore common store files as a result of restoring the link. Note that the DLL will not necessarily report common store file(s) for a set of links on the backup tape if the common store file(s) to which the particular links refer still exists on the disk.  The contents of the data stream(s) of common store files never change once they re created, so if the file already exists on the disk there is no need to restore it.  Common store file names are globally unique, so even if a restore is run on a different SIS-enabled volume from the backup, everything should work properly. BOOL SisCreateRestoreStructure( IN PWCHAR volumeRoot, OUT PVOID *sisRestoreStructure, OUT PWCHAR *commonStoreRootPathname, OUT PULONG  countOfCommonStoreFilesToRestore, OUT PWCHAR **commonStoreFilesToRestore); This is analogous to SisCreateBackupStructure.  See its description for the meaning of the parameters.  The caller is responsible for freeing the returned file names by calling SisFreeFileNames. 2.5 SisRestoredLink BOOL SisRestoredLink( IN PVOID sisRestoreStructure, IN PWCHAR *restoredFileName, IN PVOID reparseData, IN ULONG reparseDataSize, OUT PULONG countOfCommonStoreFilesToRestore, OUT PWCHAR **commonStoreFilesToRestore); Restore should call this function for each SIS link that it s restored, passing in the fully qualified filename, reparse buffer and length (of the reparse data) that was stored for the SIS reparse point on the backup tape.  countOfCommonStoreFilesToRestore and commonStoreFilesToRestore will report common store file name(s) returned.  If countOfCommonStoreFilesToRestore is non-zero, commonStoreFilesToRestore  will represent those common store files that need to be restored as a result of restoring the link.  If it is 0, then either the needed common store files have already been returned once, or are already present on the volume.  This function will return each common store file at most once per restore; subsequent links that refer to the same common store file will not return that file name.  It will never return a common store file that wasn t also returned in a SisCSFilesToBackUpForLink call during backup (presuming that the reparse data hasn t been corrupted on the tape, of course). The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. When restore restores a link file, it should just create the appropriate sparse file, write in any allocated regions (if there are any) and then set the reparse data on the file just as it was read during backup.  It is crucial that restore create sparse files with unallocated regions rather than sparse files (or non-sparse files) filled in with zeroes. 2.6 SisRestoredCommonStoreFile After restore has restored a common store file, it should call the following function: BOOL SisRestoredCommonStoreFile( IN PVOID sisRestoreStructure, IN PWCHAR commonStoreFileName); This tells SIS that a new common store file has been written, and allows it to take any action needed to initialize its internal data structures, fix up the links to the file, etc.  Restore should only restore common store files that were returned as a result of calling SisRestoredLink, even if there are more common store files on the backup tape. Restore is free to restore the link and common store files in any order it wants, but it must call SisRestoredLink after it restores any link, and must call SisRestoredCommonStoreFile after it restores any common store file.  Restore should never overwrite any common store files that are not returned from SisRestoredLink.  Naturally, since restore does not know the common store files to restore until they are reported to it as a result of restoring a link, restore will always restore a common store file after at least one link referring to it is restored.  However, it is then free to restore more links that happen to point at the same common store file. The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. 2.7 SisFreeRestoreStructure BOOL SisFreeRestoreStructure( IN PVOID sisRestoreStructure); Deletes a sisRestoreStructure and does work to cause the SIS filter to properly set up the links created during the restore.  Accessing the links before this call completes can result in a volume check and/or reading partial contents of the link.  This call may do more than just tear down the SIS DLL s data structures, and the restore should not be considered complete until it is finished.   The return value is TRUE if the call worked, FALSE otherwise.  Call GetLastError to find out why the call failed. 2.8 SisFreeAllocatedMemory VOID SisFreeAllocatedMemory( IN PVOID allocatedSpace) This function frees space allocated by the DLL.  It takes as input a pointer to some memory allocated by the DLL, and frees that memory.  After the call completes, the caller may no longer access the freed memory. This call should be used for the commonStoreRootPathname strings returned from SisCreateBackupStructure and SisCreateRestoreStructure.  It should also be used on all of the strings in the arrays of common store files returned from SisCreateBackupStructure, SisCSFilesToBackupForLink, SisCreateRestoreStructure, and SisRestoredLink.  For these functions, the array itself also needs to be freed by calling SisFreeAllocatedMemory.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Title _PID_GUIDBill Bolosky Normal Bill Bolosky Microsoft Word 8.0H1*|,AFNT 5.0 SIS Design Details Bill Bolosky DRAFT of August 3, 1998 Introduction This document is a companion to the  NT 5.0 Single Instance Store Specification.   Where the specification lays out the requirements, external and inter-component interfaces, this document details the plan of how the  various components of the Single Instance Store (SIS) work internally and interact with the various other components of Windows NT. The basic purpose of SIS is to provide single instancing of file content in NT.  That is, it creates logically separate files with separate entries in the file namespace, separate ownership and access control, sharing semantics of separate files, and which can be written with changes visible only to users of the same logical file, but which only have a single copy of the common file data on the disk. The overall architecture of SIS is that it uses NTFS reparse points as links to a common copy of the shared file contents.  A filter driver implements the appropriate copy-on-write semantics for the linked files.  SIS links are created in two ways: by a SIS-specific FSCTL that creates a new SIS link as a copy of an existing file (FSCTL_SIS_COPYFILE) and a user level service called the groveler that tracks NTFS  update log (the USN journal) and finds matching files to link together into SIS links. The SIS Filter Driver The main component of SIS is the filter driver.  The filter driver s responsibility is to implement the copy on write links, perform the copy on write, and manage the storage of the common file components.  The filter itself is an NT filesystem filter driver that loads above NTFS and as such sees all calls that come down into NTFS. On the disk, SIS links are represented by NTFS reparse points over top of a file of the appropriate size that is set sparse and empty of content.  The data in the reparse point identify the location of the file content that backs the SIS link file.  When a user attempts to open a SIS link file, the SIS filter will see the reparse point and attach an NT filter context onto the NTFS stream control block for the file.  On calls other than open (create), SIS will check for the existence of a SIS filter context, and take appropriate action if one is present. The filter s other primary responsibility is maintaining the actual file content that backs the link files.  This content is maintained in the  SIS Common Store  directory.  SIS needs to create files there when new content is added, and remove the files when all references to a particular piece of content are deleted. File Organization Externally, SIS presents a view of files that looks as if there was no single instance store.  For each file and each directory in this external view, there is a corresponding file or directory maintained by SIS (and the underlying filesystem).  Directories are maintained exactly as if SIS wasn t running.  Aside from directories, there are three types of files in a SIS system.  First there are normal files, which are files that have not been detected as being identical in content to any other file in the filesystem.  These files are handled by the underlying filesystem in the same way that they always have been.  The second type of file is a SIS link.  SIS links correspond to files that have been detected to have duplicate content (either because they were created as a copy of another file, or because the groveler detected the duplication at some time).  They are implemented as a reparse point in NTFS; the reparse point is handled by the SIS filter driver.  The third type of file is a common store file.  These are files that are maintained by SIS in a special place in the NTFS filesystem (called the common store, \SIS Common Store). Common store files contain the shared content to which link files refer, a checksum of the file contents, and a list of link files pointing at the common store file (ie., a backpointer list).  When a link file goes away (because it was deleted or because the contents was modified and the link broken by SIS) it will be removed from the backpointer list.  When the backpointer list for a particular common store file becomes empty, SIS will delete that common store file. SIS Indices SIS identifies its links by generating 64 bit unique indices for them.  Each link has exactly one index associated with it, and any index is associated with at most one link.  Indices are allocated by having a file in the common store directory called MaxIndex which contains an index number guaranteed to be at least as large as the largest index ever allocated.  Internally, SIS keeps track of the value written in MaxIndex and will not allocate an index until the file has been updated.  Typically, SIS will increment the MaxIndex value by 1000 at a time, so that most index allocations will not require waiting for the disk to update the file.  If, for some reason, the MaxIndex file should be lost, SIS will run a volume check and determine the highest link index used in the system, and regenerate the MaxIndex file based on that information. We expect that the index space is sufficiently large that it will not run out.  At a rate of one new index per millisecond, the space will last 584 million years.  Common store files are named by using a universal unique ID (UUID), which is obtained from the system UUID generating function.  The file name of the common store file is just the string version of the UUID.  We use UUIDs to name common store files rather than link indices so that they may be moved from volume to volume by the backup/restore process.  Also, by using a unique ID each time a common store file is generated, we can guarantee that the binding between a particular common store file name and its contents is permanent and universal, which is helpful in the backup/restore process. Internal Data Structures SIS has a number of data structures, some of which closely parallel what NTFS uses, and some of which are unique. SIS uses the FsRtl filter context support package to attach to file objects.  When a user open a SIS link, SIS catches the reparse point create completion, sends the open back down to NTFS with the OPEN_REPARSE_POINT flag set.  If NTFS successfully opens the reparse point (performing security and exclusion checks) and the particular link doesn t already have a filter context attached, SIS will attach a filter context to the NTFS SCB.  There is exactly one NTFS SCB per currently open file in the system.  That is, if file \users\bolosky\foo is opened twice, there will be one NTFS SCB, with one filter context attached to it.  If the file  \users\scottc\foo, which is a SIS link backed by the same common store file as \users\bolosky\foo is opened, there will be a second NTFS SCB and a second SIS filter context. A SIS filter context is associated with a SIS SCB.  Because there is exactly one filter context per NTFS SCB (for link files), there is also exactly one SIS SCB per NTFS SCB.  The SIS SCB contains a list of the portions of the file that are dirty (meaning that they have been written by through the link), and the highest address that is backed by the common store file for this particular link.  These values are used to determine if read requests need to go to the link file or to the common store file.  In addition, an SIS SCB contains a reference to a SIS PerLink. An SIS PerLink object roughly corresponds to an NTFS file control block (FCB).  There is one of these objects per opened SIS file, regardless of how many different streams are opened on the file.  (Note: currently, SIS only supports single stream files, so there is always exactly one PerLink per SCB, but in the future this doesn t need to be so).  It contains a reference count, the SIS index of the link, information about whether the file is in process of being deleted, and a pointer to the SIS common store file object. A common store file object corresponds to a file in the SIS common store.  It contains a handle and object reference to a NTFS file object for the actual common store file and a handle and file object for the metadata (backpointer) stream.  The handles are opened in PsInitialSystemProcess, both so that a user won t have access to them by guessing the handle value, and so that they will survive the destruction of any particular user process.  In normal operation, reads are directed to the common store file by substituting the common store file object for the link file object in the IRP or fastIO call, so there is no performance effect of having the handle be in a separate process context.  Common store file objects have their handles/file objects closed when all references to them disappear. Each file object that refers to a SIS link has associated with it a SIS PerFileObject (perFO) object.  These are small objects that basically just have a pointer back to the SIS scb, and some flags bits, the most interesting of which is the  opened delete on close  bit.  The perFO for a particular SIS SCB are attached to the scb; when SIS detects that a file object is a SIS file object because it has a filter context attached to it, it will scan the list for the appropriate perFO.  Note that it is possible for file objects (so called  stream file objects ) to be created without going through the normal CreateFile path, in which case SIS will only notice these file objects when it sees a call come down on one of them.  At that time, it will create a perFO for the file object on the fly. NTFS uses stream file objects to hand to the NT cache manager rather than using the user created file objects, so it is very common to see IO on a stream file object. SIS Reparse Points SIS reparse points contain several pieces of information.  These include a format version number, the link index and  common store UUID for the file, the NTFS file ID for the common store file, the NTFS file ID for the link file itself, a checksum of the contents of the common store file, and a checksum of the contents of the reparse point s data. The format version number is used by SIS to determine the format of the reparse point.  Whenever the SIS development team decides to change the contents of the reparse point, we ll increment this value.  The driver may then detect and handle back-level reparse points (or refuse to handle them, as appropriate). The link index is a 64-bit indices generated by SIS when the link was created.  The common store UUID is the ID for the common store file referenced by this link.  See 2.1.1 for a description of these indices.  The link index is unique for a given SIS link, while the common store UUID is the same for all links to a particular common store file (ie., for all links that represent the same content). The common store file NTFS file id is used as a hint.  NTFS file ids are essentially the index in the MFT (NTFS  Master File Table) of the file and a revision serial number for that particular MFT entry.  When SIS wants to open a common store file, it first opens it by ID (which is much faster than opening it by name) and verifies that it is the correct file by querying the file name.  If it is not, then it generates the file name from the common store UUID and opens the file by name. The NTFS file ID of the link file is used to verify that the reparse point is on the file on which we expect to find it.  If it is not, then most likely the reparse point has been created by some entity other than the SIS filter driver (such as a backup/restore); if this is the case, SIS will have to perform some internal consistency checks, which are described later. The checksum of the common store contents is used as a security measure.  Any reparse point that does not have the correct checksum will be ignored.  As a result, if a user were to create a SIS reparse point without going through the normal SIS mechanisms, without knowing the correct checksum the reparse point (but, say, guessing the cs file UUID) it would not allow access to the contents of the file.  If the user knows the value of the checksum, then the user must know the contents of the file or have had read access to some other SIS link to the file, which is equivalent.  Therefore, SIS takes knowledge of this checksum as prima facie evidence that the user has access to the file.  (Note that we could use an  unguessable  cryptographically secure random number in place of the checksum.) The second checksum is just a checksum of the contents of the reparse point itself and is used as a consistency check.  If this checksum is incorrect, SIS will just remove the reparse point as being invalid. Opening Files When a user opens a SIS file, SIS will pass the CreateFile call down to NTFS, which will reflect it with a STATUS_REPARSE return.  When SIS gets such a return code, it will set the FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT flag and send the call back down to NTFS.  If the subsequent open completes successfully, if needed SIS will attach a filter context to the newly created NTFS  SCB and open the SIS common store file.  The user s handle will refer to the file object created by the user s create call, which will be an NTFS file object that refers to the link file. If a user specifies FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT, SIS will catch the create, and if it succeeds will query the reparse information to find out if the file is a SIS file.  If so, it will attach to it just as if the user hadn t specified FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT.   SIS/NTFS Interactions SIS forwards most calls that come down on SIS files to NTFS.  For the most part, these calls can go to the link file (ie., SIS does nothing and sends the call through untouched).  The exception is certain read calls (and a few exotic things like set reparse point).  When SIS receives a read request, it looks in its SCB to see if the region being read is clean or has been written.  If it s clean, SIS replaces the file object in the IRP (or fast IO call) with the file object for the common store file.  If it s dirty, SIS lets the call go down on the original file object to the link file.  If the read includes both dirty and non-dirty regions, SIS will split the read up into pieces and handle them one at a time. The interactions between SIS, NTFS, Cc, Mm and the Io system are described in detail in David Goebel s SIS specification, so I m not going into more depth here. Copy on Write When a user writes to a SIS file, the writes go to the link file.  When all handles to a given link file are closed, SIS will do a  final copy.   Final copy takes all of the sections of the file that haven t been dirtied and copies them from the common store file into the link file, and then removes the reparse point.  This turns a SIS file into a non-SIS file.  SIS does the final copy when it s received cleanups for all of the handles, not when it s received closes, since the system typically delays closes arbitrarily. The details of copy on write as well as the more general read/write paths are spelled out in detail in David Goebel s SIS spec. Creating SIS Links SIS links are created in two ways: a copy file request and a duplicate detection.  When a SIS link is created, it may be the first time that that particular content was put into the common store, or it may refer to content that is already in the common store. If the newly created SIS link will result in content being moved into the common store (ie., this is new file content for SIS), SIS will allocate a UUID for the common store.  It will then copy the file into the common store using the filename that corresponds to the UUID.  (We need to do a copy and not a rename because rename would take the file ID with it into the common store, and we have to have the copied-from file retain its file ID).  After the copy completes, SIS allocates an index for the link, converts the user s file into a reparse point and writes the appropriate indices into the reparse point.  SIS then proceeds with the initial copy as in the case where the original file was a link. In the case of a copy, SIS will create a new SIS link in the copied-to location referring to the appropriate common store file, and will write the appropriate backpointer into the common store file.  A duplicate detection is similar to a copy, except that SIS simply converts the detected file into a SIS link (reparse point), thus preserving the security information. If the source of a SIS copy is not already a SIS link, SIS must open the file exclusively for the copy to succeed.  If the source is already a SIS link, then the filter will open it FILE_SHARE_READ.  Renaming SIS Links Rename operations on SIS links that operate within the same volume are simple.  SIS simply opens the link file and calls the NTFS rename operation on it.  If the rename overwrites an existing SIS link, then SIS needs to handle that as a typical delete of a link.  Regardless, there is no need to access the underlying common store file.   Cross volume renames are transparent to the kernel, and look like a read-write-delete combination, which will be handled by the normal read & delete operations in SIS.  Hence, they require no special support. Deleting and Reference Counting Each SIS common store file contains an  backpointer  index in its metadata stream.  This index is a list of pairs of <linkIndex,NtfsLinkFileId>.  Whenever a new SIS link is created by SIS, it makes a new entry in the backpointer list of the corresponding common store file.  Because link indices are always allocated sequentially and entries in the list are always made for newly allocated link indices, the list will always be sorted and will remain sorted when new entries are appended.  By using binary search, lookups in the list are O(log n) and insertions are O(1).  Deletions are processed by marking an entry as unused by setting the NtfsLinkFileId to an invalid value, and then truncating the list if possible, and thus take O(log n) time. If a new reparse point is created outside of SIS (by, say, disabling the driver and then running a restore) when the SIS driver is re-enabled and the user tries to open the link file, SIS will first verify that the CS file checksum contained in the link file is correct.  If it is, then SIS will notice that there is no backpointer entry for the file (or that the backpointer entry has the wrong file id).  SIS will allocate a new link index, rewrite the reparse point and insert the new entry in the backpointer list.  It will then initiate a volume check to detect other inconsistencies. When a file is deleted, SIS will remove the backpointer entry.  When all backpointer entries for a given file go away, SIS will delete the common store file as being unused.  If SIS believes that for some reason its backpointer database has become corrupt (probably because of a restore without the SIS filter driver running) it will initiate a full volume check.  When it does this, it will scan the entire set of reparse points on the volume, and will build appropriate backpointer indices for them.  During the check, SIS will use the old set of backpointer indices, but will never delete a common store file whose reference count went to zero, because it cannot be sure that there are no references to it.  Once the new set of indices is completely built, SIS will switch over from the old to the new backpointer sets, and delete any common store files without any references.  Note that we expect that volume checks will be rare, because the index set should only get out of whack if SIS reparse points are updated without the knowledge of the SIS filter.  Even when applications directly write SIS reparse points SIS will track them and update the indices correctly, so volume checks should only occur if reparse points are created without the driver running, if the common store backpointers are overwritten, or if the disk itself is  corrupted. Security Because SIS links look like real, independent files to their users, ownership and security needs to be associated  with the link rather than the common store file.  The user will set up ownership and ACLs on the link files just as they would with any other files.  When the SIS driver attempts to open the link file as part of the normal file create process, Ntfs will do the standard permission checks at that time. SIS prevents users from creating bogus SIS links by verifying the checksum in the link against the common store file to which the link refers before allowing an open to complete; any reparse points with bogus checksums will be deleted.  Thus, in order to construct a valid reparse point, the user must first know the contents of the file, or at least have read another reparse point and copied out the checksum.  Since having access to a SIS link only gives the user access to read the data, but not to change anyone else s copy, allowing a user who can demonstrate knowledge of the file content to access that file content is no loss of security. Common store files (and in fact the entire \SIS Common Store directory) are set to be accessible only to administrators.  As a result, users can t circumvent SIS and read the common store files directly (unless they have full access to the local filesystem, in which case they could read the raw disk or override security on the user s links anyway). General Restrictions In the first version, SIS will not handle multi-stream Ntfs files.  SIS will not permit them to be the target of a copyfile command. [Note: we are considering limited support for multi-stream files, wherein the single instance behavior will only occur on the primary stream.] SIS will not permit files with extended attributes to become links.  SIS will not handle sparse or encrypted files.  SIS will not run on the boot volume, so that files that might need to be loaded by the bootloader won t be turned into SIS links. SIS will not allow encryped files to be SIS links, and if an encryption is attempted on a SIS link, SIS will copy the file out before allowing EFS to work on the file. SIS will not work on files that already have reparse points on them, such as NSS or HSM files. The Groveller Runs as an NT service with admin privs.  Communicates with SIS through an FSCTL interface.  Is cleverly designed to take best advantage of the tradeoff in time spent computing checksums and comparing files, realizing that a pretty crappy but extremely cheap checksum function (that, say, ignores entirely much of the contents of a file) may wind up causing few enough false matches to be cheaper than a higher quality checksum.  Has an interface with the filter driver that says  I guarantee that these files are identical, you can smash them.   Obtains a list of recently written/created files from the NTFS USN journal as possible candidates for smashing.  Uses a JET database to maintain the sets of files with equal size/hash key.

If you have any comments, please email them to bolosky. Introduction As part of the Zero Administration Windows (ZAW) effort for NT 5.0, Microsoft plans to store the files from all machines within an institution (corporation, university, governmental agency, etc.) in a single namespace.  Because there is great similarity between the files on various machines, there will be considerable duplication of content within these institution-wide namespaces.  For instance, there will likely be many copies of the various system binaries, font files, and installed legacy applications. In order to reduce the storage requirements at the servers, ZAW will include a single instance file store (SIS).   A single instance file store is a system for storing files that has the property that if more than one file having the same contents is located in the store, only one copy of the actual file contents will be stored, and all logical instances of the file will refer to this master copy.  These links are visible only within the filesystem and to backup applications.  A normal (non-backup) user of the filesystem will be unaware that files are linked to common contents.  All semantics including security, writing, locking and deleting will be identical to normal, private files. SIS combined with Client Side Caching (CSC) will result in a system that presents a single institution-wide file namespace while not greatly increasing the load on the network, servers, disks and while only modestly increasing the file storage requirements at the server. The SIS technology can also be run on workstations.  Studies of the contents of filesystems on current machines show several percent replicated content within a single machine.  Running SIS on the workstation would recoup this space.  Furthermore, since CSC uses the NTFS to store its cached files, and because NTFS + SIS exports nearly identical semantics to NTFS, it is should be possible to run SIS underneath CSC on ZAW clients.  However, Microsoft does not consider this to be a supported feature in NT 5. Requirements SIS must not noticeably reduce the reliability of the NT 5.0 system on which it is hosted. SIS must be able to detect and merge files with identical contents that are otherwise unrelated. SIS must have only a minor impact on the performance of normal-path file operations that do not result in an SIS action (i.e., forcing a copy-on-write and to a lesser extent revectoring an open). SIS must present to the user the abstraction of totally independent files, regardless of whether they re linked.  This means that writes to a linked file should be visible only through the opened file name (and things hard linked to it), and not through any other file names that formerly had the same contents. SIS must provide a copy-file function that simply creates a link without accessing any file data, provided that the source file is already a SIS link. Backup applications must be able to detect links as links rather than as separate files. SIS must preserve the security semantics of the non-SIS filesystem. SIS must be able to compute signatures for files when needed. SIS must support NTFS as an underlying filesystem; other underlying filesystems are optional. SIS must not place an undue load on the system when it is not otherwise idle for deferrable tasks such as signature computation and file comparison.  Conversely, it should be able to take advantage of free time and bandwidth to accomplish these tasks without undue delay. In low free disk situations, SIS should be able to increase its resource consumption in order to more quickly free up space, even if this adversely impacts normally higher priority activities.  The extent of  allowable adverse impact should increase as available disk space decreases, and as the demand to store new files increases. Quotas will be handled as if SIS did not exist.  That is, each user will be charged for the full size of all of the files that the user owns, regardless of whether their contents are shared. 3. Architecture SIS consists of two major components: a filter driver, and a file groveler which maintains a signature database.  The filter runs in the kernel, while the groveler and its database run as a user level service. The filter driver attaches itself above NTFS, and for the most part simply passes requests through unmodified.  It handles opens of files that are SIS links by redirecting reads to unmodified portions of the file to a backing file; processes file copy requests by creating links; detects writes to files that are SIS links; deals with maintaining the reference count on backing files when links to them are created and destroyed; and merges duplicate files into a single backing file when instructed to do so by the groveler. The groveler is responsible for computing signatures for files for which there are no current signatures in the database, and reporting matching files to the filter driver.  It carefully monitors system load, and runs only when it will not interfere with higher priority activities.  The groveler s signature database keeps track of the checksums recorded for the various files. The filter driver queries the database to find checksums in order to respond to  get checksum  requests from clients. SIS uses NTFS as the underlying filesystem.   This underlying filesystem is divided into two portions: the shared namespace and the common store.  The shared namespace is a normal NTFS directory tree that corresponds exactly to the namespace exported by the SIS server.  That is, for every file or directory that a user places in the single instance store, there will be exactly one corresponding file or directory in the shared namespace. In addition, files that are not SIS links exist in the shared namespace.  When SIS detects that two files in the shared namespace are common, it copies the contents of one of them to the common store, and replaces the files in the shared namespace with SIS links. SIS links are implemented using NTFS reparse points that are handled by the SIS filter driver.  A file backed by contents in the common store is represented by a reparse point in the shared namespace.  When a user opens such a file, SIS first passes the open request to NTFS.  NTFS checks the ACL permission on the link, and if the check succeeds, it hands the open back to SIS with a STATUS_REPARSE.  SIS then notes that the reparse point is a valid SIS reparse point, turns on the flag that instructs NTFS to open the reparse point itself and returns the open request to NTFS.  NTFS will then open the reparse point, and SIS subsequently attaches a filter context to the file object.   A filter context is a new facility provided by the Microsoft Filesystem Runtime Library that allows filter drivers to associate state with a file object owned by some other filesystem.  The filter context facility allows SIS to efficiently determine whether a particular file object has SIS semantics. The hash function used to compute file signatures, its implementation and the size of the file signature are not part of the SIS specification, and may vary from installation to installation.  The SIS team will supply a hash function that is known to work well.  4. Interfaces 4.1 SIS Filter Driver-External Filesystem Users For the most part, the SIS Filter Driver is transparent to users above it, save that it implements a few new FSControls, and that the available disk space may be larger than would otherwise be expected.  In particular,  SIS links are not visible to external applications like normal symbolic or HSM links are.    As such, the Filter Driver/filesystem user interface is quite small, and is isolated to those few functions that are unique to SIS.  Of course, SIS also can take action on normal filesystem IRPs actions such as open file, write file, and delete. The first call in the interface is the fast copy function.  It is implemented as an FSControl.  For now, we will pass this call down on an arbitrary handle in the SIS file system.  This call will only succeed if there are no open handles to either the source or destination file (because these handles would wind up pointing to reparse points after the call completes; copying from a source that is already a SIS file when the driver can open the file read only/share read will succeed).  Empty files may not be copied by using this interface. FSCTL_COPY_FILE Parameters: Handle - A handle to some arbitrary file on the volume (or    to the volume itself) where the source file is. Source File Name - The NT pathname of the file to copy.  The caller must be    able to open the file for read. Destination File Name - The NT pathname of the place to put the new copy. Replace if Exists - Boolean OnlyPermitFastCopy - If set, fail the copy if it would involve copying the file data Possible returns: STATUS_SUCCESS STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE -  Source file does not exist STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED -  Caller cannot read source or write destination STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES - Not enough memory to complete request STATUS_DISK_FULL - Insufficient disk space  STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION Either the source or destination couldn t be opened Exclusively STATUS_CANT_WAIT - OnlyPermitFastCopy is set and this call would force a copy Quota error (?) - The user has exceeded the allowed disk quota Source file emptyetc. In addition, the user should be prepared for an unknown fsctl error, in case SIS is not running.  In this case, the caller should proceed with whatever copy method it otherwise used. FSCTL_SET_SIS_OPEN_PRIVELEGES Parameter: Handle - volume handle Enable - are we turning this priv. on or off. This call identifies the calling thread as being privileged, in the sense that it can directly manipulate SIS links.  The filter driver will allow it to open link files (using FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT) and to get and set the contents of link files without interference. 4.2 SIS Filter Driver-SIS Groveler The interface between the groveler and the filter driver is privileged and not remotable.  It consists of  two one fsctls FSControl that implements the three functions in the interface between the groveler and the filter.  Which function is being invoked is determined by an operation code (opcode) that s the first thing in the parameter block.   For security purposes, the filter rejects any calls on this interface that aren t made on a specific file, \SIS Common Store\GrovelerFile.   This file is protected in such a way that only administrators can open it, thus guaranteeing that non-privileged users cannot successfully make the call.implementing the  The SIS groveler tells the filter driver when it has detected files that match.  The groveler is responsible for assuring that the files are in fact identical before it tells the filter driver.  In order to avoid locking files during the time that the filter is comparing them, it acquires an exclusive oplock on the files before comparing any of their bits, and holds onto the oplock until the filter is complete or the system sends an oplock break.  By using an oplock like this, if any other user attempts to open either of the files, the groveler can stop what it s doing, close the files and acknowledge the oplock break.  Furthermore, it uses an event to tell the filter that an oplock break has occurred and that it should abort the merge. One complexity in doing the file comparison is file mapping. A process can map a file, then close the handle used to create the mapping.  At that point, the groveler could open the file and take an exclusive oplock on the file; it has no way to tell that another process could be doing mapped writes to the file, and so no way to guarantee that the files that it reports to the filter are in fact identical.  In order to correct this problem, the filter exports to the groveler an operation that determines if a file has a current user-level mapping in existence.  The groveler makes this call before it starts reading a file for comparison or signature computation purposes.  The exclusive oplock guarantees that no new mappings will be created. The other two opcodes in the interface specify that a file is identical with another file, and should be merged with it.  The first call says that two normal user files are identical, while the second call says that a user file is identical with a file already in the SIS common store. The first part of the interface is the call that tells the filter that the groveler has determined that two files have identical content.  They may both be normal files, or one or the other or both of them may be SIS links.  The groveler guarantees that there are no other users of the files (presumably by holding an exclusive oplock on each of them).  This is a privileged call, and is not remotable. FSCTL_SIS_FILES__MATCH Parameters: Opcode - CheckMapping, MergeFiles or MergeWithCS For CheckMapping: FileHandle - Handle to the file to check for a mapping For MergeFiles: FileHandle1 FileHandle2 - NT name for second fileHandles to the files to merge AbortEvent - An event set to request that the filter stop the merge operation For MergeWithCS: For MergeWithCS: FileHandle - Handle to the normal file to merge CSFileId - Identifier for the common store file with which to merge AbortEvent - An event set to request that the filter stop the merge operation Possible Returns: STATUS_SUCCESS STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION   for CheckMapping indicates that the file is mapped STATUS_DISK_FULL Oplock broken Various generic failures The next call is used by the groveler to inform the filter driver that it got an oplock break on one or the other of the files that it had previously sent down in FSCTL_SIS_FILE_MATCH.  The call always returns success regardless of whether the filter completes the match call or aborts it.  The match call itself will return the appropriate status.  The groveler will not acknowledge the oplock break until the oplock broken call returns from the filter. FSCTL_SIS_OPLOCK_BROKEN Parameters: Handle - FileHandle1 from the files match call. Possible returns: STATUS_SUCCESS 4.3 Groveler-External World The interface between the groveler and the external world primarily consists of settings to control the aggressiveness of the checksum computation process.  In particular, its sensitivity to system CPU load, disk load, free disk space, rate of disk space consumption, speed of computation of the hash function, and the length of the unprocessed part of the change log can all be set.  In addition, there is a call to tell the groveler to ignore all files smaller than a certain size.  Most files are small, but most disk space is contained in large files, so significant reductions in overhead without much loss of disk savings can be accomplished by ignoring small files.  These settings live in the registry and are only inspected on groveler startup.  The exact set of parameters in the groveler-external world interface has yet to be determined.The groveler is a system service, and responds to the normal set of service requests.  These are requests such as start, stop, pause, restart, etc.  In addition, it has one service specific control request that tells it to ignore its normal non-aggressive system use policy, and instead to complete all work currently on its queue without delay. 5. Implementation Details The files in the common store are all reference counted.  The reference count is stored in a separate stream of the common store file (called  :refs ).  When the reference count for one of the files gets to zero, the file is deleted from the common store. Because the reference count only needs to be updated when new links are created or old ones are deleted, updates to the reference counts should be somewhat infrequent. SIS links refer to common store files.   The common store files also contain a pointer back to each link that refers to the file. These back pointers are not used to verify that the link is valid, but rather are used to decide when all of the links to a particular common store file are gone, and to delete the common store file when it has no more references.   A simple reference count would suffice for this function, but it is difficult to keep such a reference count in sync with the set of links pointing to the common store file when a system crash occurs during the creation or removal of a link. Users may set SIS reparse points on files directly, rather than using the normal methods of calling FSCTL_SIS_COPYFILE or having the groveler merge identical files.  The intent of this is primarily to allow backup and restore operations to save and recreate links, but in principle any user can create a SIS link in this way.  There is a security concern here: if a user can set a SIS reparse point that refers to a particular common store file, the user can then read through the newly created link to the common store file, and see its contents.   The SIS architecture solves this problem by including in the SIS reparse point data a signature of the contents of the common store file.  In order to determine what this signature is, the user needs to know the contents of the common store file, or to have had access to another link to the file in order to read the signature directly.  In either case, this proves that the user could have read the contents of the common store file, and so allowing the user to do so through the new link does not present any new information, and so is innocuous. The groveler will use the USN change log from NTFS to determine the list of files that are candidates to have their checksums computed.The groveler needs to know when files on a volume have changed or just been created in order to check to see if there are any newly created matches.  NTFS 5.0 provides a feature called  the USN journal that tracks just this kind of information.  The groveler uses this journal to determine which files to check.  If the journal wraps (ie., the groveler misses some journal entries for whatever reason), the groveler will re-scan the entire volume and recreate the signature database.  The filter driver will set the size of link files (underneath the reparse point) to be equal to the size of the file in the common store, and set the files to be sparse.  Thus, link files will charge the appropriate amount of quota and look like normal files when their directory entries are considered, but will not occupy disk space for the file data.  When a user writes to a SIS link, the filter will forward the write directly to the link file. Other implementation details are covered in the companion document  NT 5.0 SIS Design Details. 6. Hash FunctionsFinding Matching Files The groveler s main duty is to find files with identical content, and to report them to the filter for merging.  The simplest way to implement this function would be to compare every file in the system to every other file, but that would be prohibitively expensive.  Instead, it computes a signature for every file.  If it finds two files that have matching signatures, it compares them to one another byte-for-byte, and reports them to the filter if they match.  Because two files that have identical contents necessarily have identical signatures, if the signatures of two files do not match, then they must necessarily be different, and there is no need to compare them.  By computing such signatures on files and using them to filter the set of whole file comparisons that need to be done, the groveler is able to greatly reduce the overall amount of work that would otherwise be needed to find matching files. The question then becomes what signature computation to use.  We would like to have a signature that is both inexpensive to compute, and that is unlikely to yield false positives (ie,. to produce matching signatures for differing files).  To some extent, these goals conflict with one another.  We have chosen a strategy that applies a high quality, fairly high cost hash function to a fixed-size portion of a file in order to compute that file s signature.  That is, we do a good job of generating a signature that only describes a possibly small fraction of the file.  Thus, our signature computation does not depend on the size of the file for which the signature is being computed. There are a number of properties that one would like to have in a hash function.  Prime among these is that files of differing content should produce differing hashes.  Mathematically, as long as the hash key is smaller than the entire file contents, this is impossible.  This can be shown by observing that while the total number of has keys of length 64 bits is less than 2 x 1019, the total number of files of length 2 Kbytes is over 104900, meaning that that some key has at least 104881 different files mapped to it, regardless of the choice of hash function.  For longer files, the number of different files per possible hash key is correspondingly larger.  Therefore, a hash function should be designed to avoid mapping files that are likely to exist into the same key. Because SIS always compares files byte-for-byte, having false hash matches only impacts performance rather than correctness.  Therefore, it may make sense to use a cheaper, lower quality hash function and accept the cost of file compares on false matches as the price of having a more efficient hash. One possible hash function is the rotating XOR function.  It takes each 64 bit chunk of file data, rotates it by (address/8)%59 bits, and XORs the values into a running  total.   We choose 59 for the size of the rotation because it is less likely that files will have transposed sections separated by multiples of 59*8 bytes than separated 64*8. If we are willing to trade some speed for quality (which we probably aren t), ourOur current highest quality hash function is derived from a reference in Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures In Pascal and C by Gonnet and Baeza-Yates.   It keeps a running 64 bit total that at the end of the hash process will be the hash value, and which is initialized to 0.  For each 32 bits of the file, the running total is multiplied by 131 and the 32 bits of the file are added into the running total.  131 is used because it has the longest cycle mod 264 (meaning that for all integers i, the smallest integer p that has the property that ip mod 264 = i, is less than or equal  to the corresponding p for i = 131).  We call this function the 131-hash function.  Over a set of about 280,000 files, we found no pair of files with a matching size and matching 131-hash value that were not identical in content.  To compute the  Unfortunately, the 131-hash requires doing a 64 bit multiply for every DWORD of file data (since a 64 bit multiply is 2 32-bit multiplies, this means 1 32 bit multiply for each 2 bytes of data). signature for a file, we apply the 131-hash to a part of the file (typically, the 64 kilobyte chunks that are 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through the file for files that are larger than 128 kilobytes, and the entire file for smaller files).  We append the resulting 64 bit value to the 64 bit length of the file, and so produce a 128 bit key.  While it is entirely possible to have files that have matching signatures and differing contents (particularly if they differ in the parts of the file that are not hashed), we have found in practice that the work involved in the extra whole-file comparison generated by such false matches is smaller than the amount of work saved by doing the cheaper signature computation. Other commonly used hash functions, such as the one used to compute the packet checksum in the Internet Protocol (IP) have various problems.  The IP checksum does not depend on the order of the 16-bit words in the file, meaning that any rearrangement of the same words will result in the same checksum.  Since such rearrangements are quite common among computer files, the IP checksum is a bad choice for SIS.  The current candidate for the default hash function is the rotating XOR function.  It takes each 64 bit chunk of file data, rotates it by (address/8)%59 bits, and XORs the values into a running  total.   We choose 59 for the size of the rotation because it is less likely that files will have transposed sections separated by multiples of 59*8 bytes than separated 64*8. It might be worthwhile exploring hashing only parts of files rather than the entire files, say only the first, middle and final 64 kilobyte sections.  If it turns out that this is generates sufficiently few false matches, it could greatly reduce the amount of work that must be done by the groveller, while increasing the work done in response to false matches only a little.  The existing mechanism for specifying differing hash functions can be used to represent hash functions that ignore parts of the files. Another property that is desirable in a hash function is the ability to quickly compute the new hash value when only a few bytes of a file change.  This is simple for the rotating XOR and IP hash functions, but much more difficult for the 131-hash, which is another reason to avoid 131. Another desirable property in hash functions is to have it be difficult to find a file that produces a given hash.  In SIS this would be interesting primarily if we re thinking of implementing something like Rick Rashid s Windows Service Bureaus, in which CSC might decide not to move a file over a modem connection based solely on its checksum matching that of another file on the server.  If it were easy to compute a file given a hash value, a malicious user could prevent certain files from ever making it to the server by placing other files with the same checksums but different contents on the server.  Cryptographic hash functions have this property, and could easily be used as an SIS hash, assuming that legal restrictions can be avoided. 7. Changes to Other System Components RDR and SRV need to recognize the file names in FSCTL_COPY_FILE and handle them appropriately [done].  We may want to produce versions of the copy programs that use the FSCTL, and may even want to change the Win32 CopyFile function to do it as well. The backup component must be changed to detect SIS links and back them up as such (making sure that the common store file is  stored in the backup as well as the link).  Because of the requirement that SIS link not be visible to any component other than backup, the normal link-reporting mechanisms cannot be used, but rather backup has to be changed to use the GET_FILE_LINK call.  Unmodified backup agents will still work properly, but will back up the entire contents of the logical, exported namespace without getting the advantage of SIS s file sharing.Backup and restore require special infrastructure to properly deal with SIS links.  This is described in detail in the companion document  SIS/Backup API. Remote boot install will have to create the appropriate directories (ie.,  \SIS Common Store  and stuff under it), and install the filter driver and groveler service[done]. 8. Scenarios This section describes various envisioned usage scenarios.  Currently there s only one, but I m sure we ll add more.. 8.1 Serving Files for Remote Boot One of the major components of ZAW is remote booting.  Using remote booting, a machine boots using files that are stored on the server (and possibly locally cached using CSC) rather than simply reading files from the local filesystem.  Using a SIS server for the files to be used for remote boot allows a much more natural structure than with other proposed techniques.  In particular, the SIS server would include a directory tree that corresponds exactly to what was stored on the machine s C drive in the old arrangement.  So, for example, C: on the machine bolosky might correspond to the directory   HYPERLINK \\\\server\\commonshare\\machines\\msr\\os\\bolosky\\c  \\server\commonshare\machines\msr\os\bolosky\c  on the SIS server.  The files in this tree are exactly the files that are logically contained in bolosky s C: drive.  There will be no separate area for  read only  files, nor will there be any special copy-on-write semantics visible to the users of C: on bolosky.  Because SIS manages this store, the contents of files in the msr\os\bolosky\c area that are common with other files on the server (say in msr\os\bolosky2\c) will be SIS links and will not consume additional disk space beyond what s needed for the link itself.  As noted in the previous paragraph, there will be no user-visible copy-on-write semantics for these files.  This is because they have the semantics of non-linked, totally private files.  SIS will perform copy-on-write on any files that are eventually written, but this operation will be invisible to the user. If the machine bolosky has a local disk it will run CSC, and so once the files in the msr\os\bolosky\c share are referenced they will be faulted onto the local drive and afterward reading them will place no load on the server or network.  If bolosky is diskless, then only its in-memory cache will serve to deflect reads from going to the server.  The impact on the network and server for this situation need to be determined. An interesting issue is how the msr\os\bolosky\c tree gets populated in the first place.  There are three different possibilities.  The first is that a system administrator creates the tree, presumably by using the SIS copy file function to make links for the duplicated files in the tree.   The second possibility is a CD based install using a legacy version of setup.   In this case, the machine mounts msr\os\bolosky\c as the C drive, and then just copies files onto it from the CD like it normally would.  CSC will push these files over the network to the SIS server, which will eventually detect that they re identical to other installed files and create links for them. The third and more interesting possibility is that the machine is installed from a CD.  In this case, NT setup will know where there is another template installation tree (say in   HYPERLINK \\\\server\\commonshare\\machines\\ctemplate  \\server\commonshare\machines\ctemplate ).   For each file that the installer wants to copy from the CD onto the C drive, it will first query the server for the checksum on the corresponding template file.  (Note that multiple queries can be combined into a single network message by using the SMB ANDX technology.)  If the checksum on the template file matches the one on the local CD (which is pre-computed and stored in a special file on the CD), then setup will issue a SIS copy to copy the template file into the appropriate place in the msr\os\bolosky\c tree.  While this kind of checksum match is normally insufficient to guarantee that the files match, setup assumes a match based on matching filename, checksum, file size and trusting the administrator to not be malicious in setting up the template tree.  A final optimization would be to provide a hook in CSC to allow it to accept a file from the CD as if it had come from the server, essentially pre-paging the file in without using the network.  This scenario allows a CD-based install to produce exactly the right results both locally and on the server without ever moving any file data over the net (or onto or off of the server disk). 9. Issues We need to think about an administrative component/interface to do things like setting up the common store/shared namespace roots, selecting the hash function and controlling the aggressiveness of the groveler. We might want to support multiple hash types simultaneously.  That is, we might have more than one checksum for each file, and could use a mismatch on any type of checksum to indicate a difference in the file.  This would be useful to continue supporting back-level clients that can only compute old hash functions. We may find that the cost of keeping even a directory structure containing all shared files is too large, in which case we might want to support SIS for directories, possibly by keeping directory entries and then a difference list between the  template  directory and the one in the shared namespace, or possibly only supporting wholly identical trees. Office  97 (and possibly other applications) has the behavior that it slightly modifies the binaries of its executable files at setup time (writing in the name of the person installing the app).  As a result, office installations have a large number of bytes that cannot be saved by using SIS as described.  There are a number of possible approaches to solving this problem.  One is to be able to find sub-file sized matches.  Another possibility is to detect when files are different by only a few bytes, and record the affected bytes in the SIS link file.  Still a third possibility is to adopt an ad hoc solution for Office  97, and not cover any other cases. The Office team is removing this  feature,  so maybe we can just ignore it; currently there are no plans to try any of these possible solutions.

Bolosky, Scott Cutshall, David Goebel, and John R. Douceur Abstract Certain applications, such as centrally storing the disk contents of several personal computers, can result in a set of files with much duplicated content. Using a traditional filesystem to store these files separately results in excessive use of disk and server file buffer cache space.  Using hard or symbolic links would eliminate the excess storage requirements, but changes the semantics of having separate files, in that updates to one   of a file would be visible to users of another  copy.   We describe the Single Instance Store (SIS), a software component that implements copy-on-write for files stored on a Windows  NT Filesystem volume.  SIS is structured as a filesystem filter driver and a user level daemon process that detects duplicate files and reports them to the filter for collapsing.  This paper presents measurements of the contents of personal computer filesystems showing a substantial level of duplication of file contents, describes the design and implementation of SIS, and presents performance results.   These results show that creating SIS copies of files is fast, and that SIS file space overheads are quite small, on the order of 300 bytes/file regardless of the size of the underlying file. Introduction Copy-on-write is a technique that has been used in various forms in computer systems for quite some time, most notably in virtual memory [Rashid 81] and database [Todd 96] systems.  It is a technique whereby at the time of a   a link between the source and destination is established, and the actual copying of the data is postponed until such time as either the source or destination is modified.  In most cases, the cost of detecting and carrying out the delayed copy is greater than it would have been if the copy had been eagerly evaluated, but the usual expectation is that writes to copies rarely happen, and thus the copy operation can be eliminated altogether.  Crucial to the concept of copy on write is that it is semantically identical to a normal copy, unlike linked-file or shared memory techniques. The Single Instance Store (SIS) is a copy-on-write facility for the Windows NT File System (NTFS) [Custer 94] in Microsoft Windows  NT 5.0 [Soloman 98].   It was created to solve a specific problem with one of the proposed NT 5.0 features, but has more general applicability.  The initial plans for NT 5.0 included a  remote boot  facility, where workstations would have their filesystem data stored on a server, and would use their local disks as a cache of the contents of the server.  This facility would allow replacing machines that had died without loss of data, make it easier for administrators to keep the software on large collections of system in sync with one another, and generally move Windows  NT toward a more centralized management strategy.  Windows  NT is designed so that each machine believes that it boots from a directory that is its alone, and into which it can write.  This assumption is deeply ingrained into NT, and would be difficult to change.  So, the remote boot servers must have private directories for each different workstation served.  However, this will result in a large amount of duplicate content between these directories, with only small, machine-specific differences.  While disk space has become increasingly inexpensive, storing many copies of the system files is still expensive.  SIS was developed as a solution to this problem.  It is also helpful when setting up new machines, because there is no need to copy the installed file data on the server; rather, the new machines can have their directories created by using fast  SIS copies. We believe that in general, computer usage patterns reflect the cost of doing operations.  When the cost of an operation becomes much more or less expensive, application builders and users will change their behavior to deal with the new state of the world.  For example, in the past compiling large systems used to take hours or days, and programmers were very careful about the changes that they made in order to avoid having to rebuild due to a trivial error, such as an error that would prevent a successful compilation.  However, as machines became faster, rebuilding software systems became correspondingly faster.  Programmers responded by spending less up-front time looking for trivial errors that would quickly manifest themselves.  This is not because of some lack of virtue in the newer programmers, but rather because the tradeoffs between up-front work and rebuilding the system had changed, and the new work patterns made more sense when taken in light of the new costs.  We believe that reducing the cost (both in time and disk space) of making copies of files will have a similar effect on the way that the filesystem is used.  We do not, however, know what that effect will be. Independent of any change in the way filesystems are used, we have evidence that substantial amounts of disk space can be saved by running a system like SIS on existing filesystems.  In particular, if personal computer filesystems were served from a central fileserver as we envisioned doing in the remote boot work, our data indicate that nearly half of file space could be recouped.  Given that SIS was not terribly hard to implement and adds a fairly small overhead to run, we believe that this justifies its existence.  Our data also indicate that about 8% of file space on existing personal computer volumes could be recovered by applying SIS. The next section describes the measurements that we made of the contents of filesystems, and analyzes them with respect to SIS, finding substantial commonality of file contents.  Section 3 describes SIS s design and implementation, along with necessary background regarding NT features used in building SIS.  Section 4 presents performance results, showing the size and time overheads involved in both normal and SIS files, and finding that SIS equals or outperforms normal files for file sizes beyond about 1 Kbyte.  Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 concludes. File System Contents Prior to deciding to build SIS, we did a study of the contents of filesystems, which among other things is useful to determine the impact that SIS would have if it were run on those filesystems.  Unlike most filesystem studies, we were more interested in the static contents of the filesystem than the dynamic usage patterns.  The summary of our results as they apply to SIS is that if the entire group of filesystems that we measured were stored together, SIS could eliminate about 44% of the file storage.  Even as separate filesystems (where there is no opportunity to combine files that are not on the same filesystem) we would realize about an 8% savings.  Since SIS is intended to operate on fileservers that would store the data from the filesystems from a large number of machines, the 44% number is representative of the savings that one could expect from running SIS, and is sufficiently large to justify the effort involved in building it and the overhead involved in running it.  Given that SIS is already written, an 8% savings in disk space may also justify running it on non-server machines.  The rest of this section describes the filesystem trace data and the methodology that we used to collect it, and then presents an analysis of the data that shows both general facts about what is stored on filesystems, and determines specific facts about how SIS would operate on the filesystems in question. To first approximation, our methodology was to take a recursive directory listing of the filesystems, capturing each file name, size, write and creation dates, and position in the directory hierarchy.  Hard links are supported in NTFS, but are so rarely used that we did not check for them.  We obtained data from personal computers within Microsoft Research.  We obtained the data by sending an email to all members of Microsoft Research asking them to run a program that would scan their filesystem.  We collected this data in September, 1996.  Windows and Windows NT store their virtual memory paging data in files in the filesystem with a known name (pagefile.sys).  Before doing any processing on the data, we removed these files. There are some sources of bias in the file data.  When we sent the mail to the members of the research staff, we included the filesystem scanning program as an attachment to the mail.  To run the program on the machine that received the mail message only required double clicking on an icon in the message.  Running the program on any other machine was more work, in that the user had to save the program out to a file and then execute the file on the non-mail machine.  Probably some users ran the program on their mail machine, but not on any others.  It is typical in Microsoft Research to have a number of personal computers, and the uses of the different machines vary, possibly in a systematic way.  An additional bias is that we only requested (did not require) that people run the program, so if there is any correlation  between the types of people who choose to run the program and the types of files they store, it would affect the data.  The final, and possibly largest, source of bias is the fact that the contents of the filesystems of the computers at Microsoft Research is most likely not representative of the contents of filesystems of other user populations; we suspect without proof that there are proportionally more unique files in Microsoft Research than in the general computer user community.  All of these sources of error in our measurements mean that the results derived from them should at best be interpreted as a first order indication of what to expect in practice, and taking any meaning from small effects in the data is unwarranted. The trace data comes from 168 filesystems on more than 71 computers (it was impossible to determine the computer name for 26 of the filesystems, so we don t know from how many different computers they came), with a total formatted capacity of 283 Gbytes.  106 of the filesystems were formatted using the FAT (standard DOS) filesystem, 61 with NTFS and 1 with a then-experimental 32 bit version of FAT, which is now standard in Windows 98.  The trace contains 2.6 million files and 161 Gbytes of file data, not counting directory or metadata overhead, just the file contents proper. The following chart shows the distribution of files by size.  The files in the data set were grouped into bins by rounding the file size up to the next power of two; so, for example, the bin labeled 64K includes files from 32769 to 65536 bytes in size.  The curve labeled  File Count  shows the distribution of files, and should be read from the right hand y-axis.  The  Cum. Files  curve is the integral of the  File Count  curve, and is read on the left hand y-axis.   Byte Count  is the distribution of file data bytes (not counting filesystem overhead or bytes lost to fragmentation) by file size, and  Cum. Bytes  is its integral. This chart points out an important fact about the contents of the filesystems: most of the files are small (88% are 64Kbytes or smaller) but most of the bytes are in large files (80% of bytes are in files larger than 64Kbytes).  Files 1 Kbyte and smaller constitute only 0.16% of the total file space.  It turns out that the SIS implementation is inefficient both in speed and in space for files this small, but because they compose an insignificant portion of the file space, they are unimportant, and SIS can allow small files with identical content to remain as normal files without losing much opportunity to save space.  We also found that a very small number of files made up a significant part of the disk space.  There were 105 files (of  2.6 million) larger than 64Mbytes, and they made up about 5% of the total space. When we collected the filesystem data, we were not considering building SIS.  Therefore, we did not read the file contents and so there is no way to determine which files have identical contents from these data.  However, we made a first approximation by using the simple heuristic that files with identical names (ignoring case) and identical sizes also have identical contents, and all 0 length files are also identical.  We are aware of instances in which this is not true (some versions of Microsoft Office write the user s name into the executable binaries), and are also aware that this will miss some duplication (backup copies of files saved by text editors with a different filename; also there were more than 256 different file names for one byte files while there are only 256 possible one byte files).  However, we believe that this technique is sufficient to provide a rough estimate of the amount of duplication in the filesystems. When considered as a single large group, SIS could eliminate 71 Gbytes of file data of the 161 Gbytes total in the filesystems, or about 44%.  For each set of matching files, we computed its  bytes eliminated  as the size of the set minus one, times the size of one of the files in the set.  In other words, for each group of identical files, we kept exactly one copy, and counted the rest as savings.   Of the remaining 90 Gbytes, 20 Gbytes would be in the common store and the remainder in files with no matches.  1.9 million (73%) of the 2.6 million files would be SIS links, with 350,000 distinct file contents.  If we ignore files smaller than 1 Kbyte, then there would be 1.3 million (50%) SIS links with 260,000 distinct file contents, but the savings of disk space would be essentially the same as if the small files were included; in practice this is how we would configure SIS. When each of the 168 filesystems was considered independently, SIS would realize savings of about 14 Gbytes, or 8% of used file space.  This number is smaller because there is a smaller set of candidate files to match within a single filesystem as opposed to across all files in the set.  In particular, it is much more likely that applications and systems will be installed once on each of a number of filesystems than that they will be installed multiple times on a single file system. The following graph shows the distribution of files and bytes in the entire data set, the set of files that would be SIS links if SIS were applied to the data set as a whole, and the set of files that would be SIS links if SIS were applied to the file systems in isolation.  Unlike the previous graph, we only show the cumulative distribution curves for clarity.  The  All Files  and  All Bytes  curves are exactly the same curves as from the previous graph.  The sets of SIS files and single filesystem SIS files are smaller than the entire set, but because the graph uses frequency within the set as its y-axis, the curves all arrive at 100% at the right hand end of the scale.   The most important aspect of this graph is that while very large files make up a noticeable fraction of the bytes in the entire data set, these files are much less prevalent in the SIS sets.  This means that SIS will be less likely to have to deal with very large files, and hence less likely to have to spend large amounts of time doing copies-on-write.  The primary reason that it appears that the distribution of files for the single filesystem case is more biased towards small files than the other two distributions is because the set of single-filesystem matches is much smaller.  However, all empty files match one another, so the contribution of these files to the single-filesystem curve is proportionally higher. SIS Architecture and Design SIS has two responsibilities: providing the copy on write functionality, and discovering files with identical content in order to merge them.  These two functions are implemented by a kernel-level filesystem filter driver and a user-level service (daemon) respectively.  This section lays out the basic concepts and terms used in describing SIS and its design, provides brief background on the Windows NT underpinnings used by SIS, and then describes the SIS architecture and design in some detail. A user file whose contents is managed by SIS is called a SIS link.  The kernel mode portion of SIS (called the SIS filter) is responsible for assuring that users see appropriate behavior when accessing SIS links.  The filter keeps the data that backs SIS links in files in a special directory called the SIS Common Store.  SIS links may be created in two ways: A user may explicitly request a SIS copy of a file by issuing the SIS_COPYFILE file system control, or SIS may detect that two files have identical contents and merge them.  The user level component of SIS, which detects duplicate files, is called the groveler. The rest of this section describes how SIS is designed and constructed.  The first two subsections provide necessary background about unusual Windows NT and NTFS facilities used in the implementation.  Section 3.3 describes the SIS filter in detail, and section 3.4 covers the groveler. 3.1 The Windows NT Driver Model The privileged mode portion of Windows NT consists of a base kernel containing services such as scheduling, virtual memory support, synchronization primitives, etc.; and a set of loadable drivers [Soloman 98][Baker 97].  Windows NT drivers may have more broad functionality than device drivers in traditional systems.  They implement filesystems, network protocol stacks, RAID/Mirroring disk functionality, instrumentation, off-line file migration, and other similar functions as well as simply operating normal devices [Fisher 98].  Groups of these drivers are called stacks, although that term can be somewhat misleading, because the organization is not necessarily linear (imagine a RAID driver that talks to more than  one disk driver).  A driver that is inserted in a stack that s not absolutely necessary for the operation of the stack is called a filter driver (or sometimes just a filter). To first approximation, NT driver stacks work by passing around I/O Request Packets (IRPs), which are requests to do a specific operation, such as read, write, open or close.  For instance, a filesystem driver might receive a read IRP specifying that a range of a file should be read into a certain virtual address in a process.  The filesystem would use its metadata to find the region(s) on disk holding the data for the given part of the file, modify the IRP to tell the disk driver what action to take, and then send the IRP down the stack to the disk driver, which would perform the actual I/O.  When a driver marks an IRP as completed, any drivers above it on the stack have the opportunity to inspect the IRP, see if it completed successfully, and take action including aborting the IRP completion or changing the completion status. Because of the driver model, it is possible to develop filters with complex functionality independently of the other components with which they interact.   The SIS filter was developed without any changes in NTFS, the NT I/O Manager, Cache Manager or any other standard NT components. Sparse Files and Reparse Points in NTFS The version 5 of the Windows NT File System (NTFS) provides some new functionality that is used in the implementation of SIS.  First is its support for sparse files, and second its reparse point facility.  This section briefly describes these features. A sparse file is a file that does not have physical disk space allocated for the entire file.  A file may be marked as sparse and extended without reserving disk space to handle the extension.  An existing sparse file may have regions within the file deleted by a special IO control call.  Deleted regions have their disk allocation removed, subject to granularity restrictions.  A user can issue a different IO control that returns a description of the allocated and unallocated regions of a file.  A read to an unallocated region of a sparse file returns zeroes, and a write causes disk space to be allocated.  Unless a user specifically looks at a file to determine if it is sparse, it appears to be a normal file, possibly with a lot of the file being filled with zeroes. A reparse point is a generalization of a symbolic link.  A reparse point is placed on a file by calling an IO control function.  The reparse point consists of two parts: the reparse tag and the reparse data.  The reparse tag is a 32 bit number that specifies the type of reparse point, and the reparse data is a variable size area that is not interpreted by the filesystem, but rather is used by the component implementing the reparse point.  Typically, each type of reparse point has a corresponding filter driver above NTFS to implement its behavior.  There is a single such tag used by SIS. When NTFS receives an open request, if the file being opened has a reparse point on it, instead of doing a normal file open, it fails the request with a special status, STATUS_REPARSE, and returns the reparse tag and data along with the completed IRP.  Filters that use reparse points look for this special completion status, and then check to see if the reparse tag is known to the filter.  If not, the filter passes the completion up the driver stack.  If the filter implements the tag, the filter can take some action to implement whatever behavior is appropriate for an open of a reparse point, based on the reparse data.  If the STATUS_REPARSE is passed all the way to the top of the driver stack, it is converted into an appropriate error and the open request completes to the user as a failure. There is an option flag bit for opens, FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT, that specifies that reparse behavior should be suppressed.  Unlike Unix symbolic links, a file with a reparse point on it is still an otherwise normal file.  Specifying the flag tells NTFS that the file under the reparse point should be opened rather than returning a STATUS_REPARSE and letting the filters take action. Imagine implementing symbolic links using a filter driver and reparse points.  The filter would have a reparse tag type allocated specifically for itself.  The contents of the reparse data for a symbolic link would be the pathname component to be substituted for the file in question.  When the filter driver saw an open IRP complete with STATUS_REPARSE and the appropriate tag, it would halt the completion process, modify the open request to have the pathname component from the reparse buffer replace the file name in the original open request, and send the request back to the filesystem for further processing.  If an application wanted to create a symbolic link, it could simply place the appropriate reparse point on the file in question.  To delete a symbolic link, it would open the link using FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT and then delete it in the normal way. The SIS Filter The kernel portion of SIS is a filter driver that sits above NTFS.  It handles all normal file operations that happen on SIS links, such as read, write, open, close and delete.  It also implements a pair of special file system controls for creating new SIS links: SIS_COPYFILE, and SIS_MERGE_FILES.  COPYFILE makes a SIS copy of a file, possibly turning the source file into a SIS link in the process.  MERGE_FILES is used by the groveler to tell the filter to merge two files together. A SIS link is implemented as a sparse file of the appropriate size with (usually) no regions allocated.  Because there are no regions allocated, the file uses only as much space as is needed for its directory entry.  The link has a reparse point with a SIS tag. The contents of the data portion of a SIS reparse point are a bit string identifying common store file that backs the contents of the link, a unique identifier for the link, a signature of the contents of the common store file backing the link, and some internal bookkeeping information.  The function of the signature is described below. Creation of a SIS link is fairly straightforward.  A user issues a COPYFILE request.  If the source file is not already a SIS link, its contents are copied to a newly allocated file in the common store, and the source file is converted into a link to that common store file.  The destination file is then created as a link to the (either pre-existing or newly created) common store file.  SIS keeps some out of band information (called backpointers) associated with the common store file that contains the set of links that point to the common store file.  A COPYFILE request adds such a backpointer for the destination, and also for the source if appropriate. The reason that SIS copies the contents of a non-SIS file into the common store rather than renaming the file is that it is possible to open NTFS files by file ID, which is a number associated with the file akin to a Unix i-number.  When a file is renamed, its file ID stays the same.  Therefore, if SIS renamed the source file into the common store, users of the file ID would attempt to open the common store file rather than the link file.  By doing a real copy, the SIS filter avoids the problem, and it still does only a little more work than a traditional file copy. When a user opens a SIS link, the filter intercepts the STATUS_REPARSE completion, and resubmits the open request with the FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT flag set, resulting in the user s handle pointing at the link file (rather than at the common store file).  SIS also opens the common store file (if it has not already done so) and attaches some context to the user s handle indicating that this is a handle to a SIS link. When a user writes to a SIS file, the write happens into the link file, and SIS records that the affected portion of the link file is dirty.  Writing to a clean portion of a link file looks to NTFS like a write into an unallocated region of a sparse file, which results in the allocation of disk space.  As a result, writing into the middle of an apparently normal file can result in a disk full failure.  While this is a somewhat unusual semantic, it is not unprecedented (consider compressed files), and it is unavoidable for any copy-on-write technology that overcommits its backing store. Reads to a dirty portion of a SIS file are directed to the link file.  Reads to a clean portion of a SIS file are sent to the common store file.  Reads that span dirty and clean portions of files are split into pieces, which are satisfied independently. After all users close a SIS file that has had writes to it, the filter fills in the remaining clean regions with the data from the common store file.  If disk space should be exhausted during this process, the filter simply leaves the remainder of the file unfilled, and leaves the reparse point intact.  A subsequent open of this file results in the allocated regions of the file being marked dirty.  We could have chosen to forego filling the clean regions of a file, and instead left the link backed in part by the common store file.  If we had done so, we could have wound up in the odd situation of having SIS increase the amount of disk space used in the system, by having files that are almost completely dirty backed by large and mostly unused common store files.  To avoid this situation, we do the copy-on-close when possible.  Furthermore, we expect updates to SIS files to be relatively rare, and writes over only part of a SIS file to be more rare still, so this implementation choice is relatively unimportant. When a SIS link is eliminated, either by deletion of the link or because of a copy-on-write, the corresponding backpointer in the common store file is removed.  When all of the backpointers for a common store file are removed, the common store file is also removed. In certain circumstances, it is impossible for the SIS filter to prevent a user from writing an arbitrary reparse point.  In theory, the user could write a SIS reparse point, which the filter would then use to read data for the user from the common store.  This would be a violation of security, since the user did not have to prove access permission for the common store file before writing the reparse point.  In order to address this problem, SIS includes a signature of the common store file in the reparse data.  The signature is a hash of the entire contents of the common store file; it is easy to compute given the data in the file, but impossible to compute without the contents of the file.  Each link file contains a copy of this signature in its reparse point.  The filter will refuse to open a link file that contains an invalid signature.  A reparse point that contains an appropriate signature proves that the user already knows the contents of the common store file (or has seen another reparse point that refers to the same contents, and so could have known the contents of the file).  Because all that a user gets by creating SIS link is the ability to read the common store file contents, there is no security breach.   Oddly, there is no need to use a secure hash for common store signatures.  Secure hashes have the property that it is difficult to construct content that produces a given hash value.  Here, an attacker does not have the opportunity to construct the content, but rather needs to guess the signature without knowing the data.  For this purpose, any good hash will do.  The hash actually used in the SIS filter is the 131-hash, which is described in Section 3.4. When a user reads from a clean section of a SIS link, in most cases the data backing the read is cached per common store file rather than per link.  Thus, if a number of users access different links backed by the same common store file, the system cache will contain at most one copy of the common store data.  If the number of different links simultaneously being accessed is large, this can result in a great reduction in cache usage, and a corresponding improvement in system performance.  The exception to this case is when a user maps a SIS link file.  Windows NT shares physical memory between the system cache manager and users  mappings of files.  There is no way to change this association at the time that a user first makes a write to a mapped page.  As a result, if data for different mapped links were cached together, users of one link would see changes made to a different link.  SIS forces SIS links that have mappings to them to be cached separately from other link files.  Because of the way the NT cache model works (the details of which are beyond the scope of this paper) [Fisher 98], it is possible to handle this correctly even in the case where a user has opened a file and done normal reads into that file before a second user maps the file. The SIS filter includes a facility called volume check for repairing inconsistencies in metadata, similar to the Unix fsck and Windows chkdsk programs.  Unlike these programs, however, SIS is able to do its repairs while the system is running, without having to disrupt service in any major way.  One limitation during a volume check is that if a user deletes what appears to be the last reference to a common store file the filter will not delete the common store file until the volume check completes, because it does not trust its backpointer sets during a volume check.  The volume check process will repair the backpointer sets for all common store files, and will delete any orphaned common store files.  NTFS provides a method for efficiently finding all SIS links on a volume, so the time to complete a volume check is proportional to the number of SIS links on the volume, not to the size or total number of files on the volume. SIS provides a special interface to backup/restore applications that allows them to behave appropriately when faced with backing up and restoring SIS links.  The goal is to have exactly one copy of the SIS file content on the backup tape for each set of SIS links backed up.  SIS provides a dynamically linked library (DLL) that the backup/restore application calls.  The DLL tells backup when it needs to back up common store files.  On restore, the DLL looks to see if the appropriate common store file already exists or if it s already reported that file to restore.  If not, then it reports the common store file corresponding to the link being restored.  Because common store files have universally unique file names, and their content never changes once the file is created, if the common store file still exists on the volume there is no need to restore over it. The Groveler The groveler is a user level process that finds duplicate files in the file system, and reports these files to the SIS filter for merging.  The essence of its task is to efficiently find the sets of matching files on a volume, and to keep the sets up to date as the volume changes.  It maintains a database of signatures of files on the volume, and uses NTFS 5.0 s update journal feature to track files that have changed and to update their database entries. The groveler database contains two structures: a work queue, and a mapping of signatures to files.  The work queue contains work items of two types.  The first is to compute the signature of a file, and the second is to compare a file to any others with matching signatures.  The groveler has a thread that runs periodically, reads entries from NTFS s update journal and if appropriate makes entries on the groveler s work queue.  If the groveler misses entries in the USN journal (the journal entries wrap), it detects this fact and re-scans the entire database. A second thread drains items from the work queue, either computing a signature or comparing a pair of files for each item.  It then updates the database, possibly instructs the filter to merge two files, and removes the item from the queue. The groveler uses a 128 bit file signature.  The first 64 bits of the signature are the size of the file.  It is inexpensive to obtain the file size, and files with differing size obviously cannot be identical.  The remaining 64 bits are computed by running a hash function on a fixed portion of the file s contents.  We hash two 64 kilobyte chunks of file contents from the middle of the file (unless the file is less than 128 kilobytes in size, in which case we hash the entire file).  By hashing only a part of the file, we will have cases where files differ in the portions not considered by the hash function, but still have the same signature.  However, in practice files that differ in contents most often differ in size, are small, or are different in most of the file.  The particular signature computation that we use is called the 131-hash.  For each word considered, it m g files.  It does this in part because it has a very low rate of reuse of file contents, and in part to prevent itself from taking up file buffer cache space that could better be used for other applications. The groveler is set up to run as a low priority background task (unless disk space is tight).  The groveler is not particularly CPU intensive; most of the work it does is disk I/O.  We expect that it will be common to run it on fileservers, where most applications are not CPU bound.  As a result, simply running it at low scheduling priority does not prevent it from interfering with other, more important tasks.  The groveler uses a scheme where it tracks its own rate of progress, and slows down its run rate when its progress slows.  The premise is that if the groveler is running more slowly, it must be contending with some other, higher priority process for some resource.  A companion paper [Douceur 99] discusses this technique in detail. Performance Results s primary performance measure is reducing disk and system buffer cache usage.  Secondary goals include providing fast file copies for large files, not significantly impacting copy speed of small files, being efficient in finding duplicate files to merge, and not having the groveler impact system performance unless disk space is tight.  In this section, we address all of these metrics save the last one, which is considered in detail in [Douceur 99]. All performance results reported in this section were obtained by running tests on an unloaded machine that was disconnected from the network.  The machine used is a Gateway 2000 G6-200 Pentium Pro 200 MHz machine, with 128MB of memory.  The disk that held the SIS filesystem for the tests was a Seagate 2Gbyte Barracuda ST32550N.  It is running an internal pre-release version of Windows NT 5.0 Beta 2.  The filesystem on the disk was newly formatted and mostly empty. A simple measurement of the reduction in disk space in is straightforward.  We just measure the space used by SIS links, observe that it does not depend on the size of the underlying file and report the amount of space taken per SIS link.  A more realistic technique would be to set up a system running SIS and to let it age under a real user workload for a period of time, and then to measure the savings in disk space by inspecting the resulting filesystem.  Unfortunately, while SIS is ready for such a test, the other components that would allow multiple machines to operate from a single server are incomplete at this time, so we are reduced to the simple test.   The following graph shows the average non-data disk space used by a SIS link and by a normal file as a function of the size of the file.  Here, we are attempting to measure the total space used other than the space used for storing the file contents, including various NTFS and SIS metadata and space wasted due to fragmentation.  Therefore, our methodology was to observe the total disk free space, make a certain number of copies of a file of the appropriate size, measure the free disk space again, take the difference and divide by the number of copies made.  We made 10,000 copies of the file for all of the SIS tests, and for all of the normal file tests where the total copied file space would not exceed 1 billion bytes; we reduced the number of normal copies appropriately to keep from exceeding that limit.  The reason that we did not just make a single copy and observe the difference in available disk space is that NTFS tends to allocate space for resident attributes (basically directory entries, reparse points and file data for very small files) in big chunks at the per-directory level, so it is possible to create a new file and see no drop in the amount of disk space used.  By making a large number of copies, we were able to reduce the error introduced by this allocation granularity.  The fact that we couldn t make a large number of copies for the normal copy, large file cases is probably why their error bars are so big.  In fact, the 108 byte normal copy test (where we made only 10 copies per run) was so noisy that the 90% confidence error was so big that the datum was meaningless.  It is important to remember that all of the file space used by SIS is  overhead  while in the NTFS case the file data is also stored, so for the large file case the total SIS disk usage is tiny compared with the NTFS usage.  The data show that SIS files use about 300 bytes, regardless of the size of the file to which the link points.  For small, non-SIS files there is a somewhat smaller overhead, about 200 bytes, and for files this small the additional cost of storing the file data is smaller than the difference in overhead, so it uses more space to store these files as SIS links, regardless of how many links point to a single common store file.  This is because for non-SIS files there is no need to store the reparse point attribute or the backpointers in the common store file.  Because the filesystem on which these files were stored was newly formatted and almost empty, NTFS was able to allocate the large files in a small number of extents on the disk, thus it needed only a very small amount of metadata even for enormous files. The next graph shows the time to make copies when running the same test.  When SIS copies a file that is not already a SIS link, it needs to make a copy of the actual file data into the common store.  For this reason, before running the SIS copy tests we first copied the source file to make it into a SIS file.  The graph does not show the points for the copy time for normal copies of files of  ld expect, this graph shows that normal copy time grows linearly with the size of the file being copied after a constant overhead of about 5ms (the curve looks exponential on the graph because the x-axis is exponential and the y-axis is linear), and that the SIS copies do not grow with the size of the file.  One interesting fact is that SIS copies of small files take significantly longer (about 22ms) than SIS copies of large files (about 8ms).  We have not fully investigated the reason for this, but we believe that it is related to the cost of adding a reparse point to a file that is otherwise small enough to be  resident  (ie., one in which NTFS would normally store the file data in the directory entry). Related Work There are a number of different uses of copy-on-write in computer systems.  They generally share the same characteristics: A traditional copy would be expensive in time or space (or both), the semantics presented to the user are those of a copy, rather than a link, and the expectation of the system designer is that the copy-on-write will rarely happen.  Typically, the cost of the initial   followed by the copy-on-write is higher than just eagerly evaluating the copy, but this is made up for by the common case in which the copy-on-write never happens. Copy-on-write has been used in virtual memory systems as least as far back as Accent [Rashid 81] and Mach [Accetta 86][Young 87].  These systems allowed processes (including filesystems) to send messages to one another with copy semantics, but used the virtual memory system to map the same memory into both processes  address spaces.  If a process subsequently wrote into the memory, the system took a protection fault, made a copy of the page in question, and mapped the newly copied page into the faulting process s address space read/write. The database system underlying the Microsoft Exchange Server [Todd 96] (a multi-user mail server) uses copy-on-write techniques for mail messages that are sent to multiple recipients, and even calls the technique  Single Instance Store.   This mail system allows recipients to modify mail messages after they re received.  However, this is a fairly rare thing for a user to do, so the final copy is rarely executed. Apollo systems used access control lists (ACLs) that described the lists of users who had access to particular files.  These ACLs were immutable.  The salacl command looked through the sets of ACLs existing in the system, and combined those that matched, essentially implementing a single instance store for ACLs. [Leach 98] Conclusion If the filesystems from multiple personal computers are taken together, a large fraction of the files are duplicates of one another.  Removing these duplicates can substantially reduce the amount of disk space required to hold these filesystems.  The Single Instance Store is an implementation of a copy-on-write technique that allows combining of files while still preserving the semantics of private files. We found that SIS has low overhead, both in space and in copy time.  SIS links use less space than normal files for files  larger than about 100 bytes, and SIS copies (of files that are already SIS links) are faster for files of about 10,000 bytes and larger, provided that the source is already a SIS link.  Our filesystem measurements show that nearly all of the space involved in duplicate files is in files larger than a few kilobytes, so the space overhead of SIS would be negligible in practice.  The implementation of SIS is small, self-contained and transparent to users of on with Rick Rashid, Nathan Myhrvold and Terri Rashid.  Rob Short and Chuck Lenzmeier were invaluable in navigating the politics of the Windows NT group.  Brian Andrew provided help in understanding NTFS and its behaviors, and provided useful suggestions as to how to implement SIS.  Felipe Cabrera commented on the SIS/backup interactions.

Building NT fdisk's boot code
                    -----------------------------


    The master boot code is contained in the file x86mboot.c, which is
#include'd into fd_nt.c.  The boot code is in the form of an array
(named x86BootCode) of unsigned chars, which is refered to by code in
fd_nt.c when fdisk needs to lay boot code on the disk.

    The x86mboot.c file is generated by different means depending on the
compilation host (ie, whether you're building on x86 or MIPS).


The following applies to x86 ONLY:
----------------------------------

    The master boot code is built from the x86mboot.asm and x86mboot.msg
files in i386 by running masm386 over these files to produce x86mboot.obj.

Then link_60 is run over x86mboot.obj to produce x86mboot.com. The boot code
is at offset 1280 in this file (1280 = 600h-100h.  600h is where the boot
code is assembled, and 100h is where a .com file is loaded by DOS.)  It is
of length 0x1be (512 byte sector - 64-byte partition table - signature word).

The tool bin2c.exe (in sdktoosl) is run over x86mboot.com to generate
i386\x86mboot.c.


The following applies to MIPS ONLY:
-----------------------------------

    On MIPS, the best we can do is check in the 'finished' product of the
x86 process, namely x86mboot.c, into the mips directory (we cannot run
masm386 or link_60 on MIPS!).  If, however, the i386\x86mboot.asm or .msg
files are newer than mips\x86mboot.c, then that means that someone changed
the boot code but did not check in the .c file to mips\x86mboot.c.  So we
generate an error message.

The correct action when receiving this error message is to go to an x86
machine, bget or build the i386\x86mboot.c file, and check that file
into mips\x86mboot.c.  Then sync on the MIPS machine.






    Our build process generates a -I parameter to the compiler based on
the compilation environement (ie, -Imips\ or -Ii386\).  This allows fdisk
to simply '#include "x86mboot.c"' and get either the generated file on x86
or the file under source control for MIPS.  This way we maintain at least
a semblance of the correct dependencies should the x86mboot.msg file be
translated, etc.

Interrupt Affinity Filter -- How it works:
==========================================

IntFiltr works by intercepting a specific PnP IRP that is passed to 
devices (IRP_MN_START_DEVICE).  

The filter looks at the (translated) resource list that is passed along 
with this IRP, and modifies the affinity mask (according to settings 
specified by the user) for any of the Interrupt resources in the device's 
resource list.  This modified IRP is then passed-on to lower drivers in 
the stack.  

As a result, lower drivers (which use entries in this resource list when 
setting up their ISRs) will get their ISRs installed only on the set of 
processors that the user has specified (via the IntFiltr configuration 
tool).  

The end result is that the APIC gets programmed to direct certain 
interrupts to certain subsets of the CPUs in the system (which can be 
verified by doing a "!ioapic" in the debugger).  

                    ------------------------------

NOTE: one of the main challenges in writing this filter was ensuring 
that it could be installed on _any_ device stack.

DESCRIPTION:
============
This Interrupt-Affinity Filter (IntFiltr) allows a user to change the 
CPU-affinity of the interrupts in a system.  

Using this utility, you can direct any device's interrupts to a specific 
processor or set or processors (as opposed to always sending interrupts to 
all the CPUs in the system).  Note that different devices _can_ have 
different interrupt-affinity settings.  This utility will work on any 
machine, regardless of what processor or interrupt controller or HAL is 
used.  

Obviously, this tool is only interesting for multi-processor machines.  



USAGE:
======
There are 2 things that must be done in order to use IntFiltr.  These are: 

(1) Install the filter [only needs to be done once per machine]
(2) Configure the filter [whenever you want to change settings]



1. Installing the IntFiltr
--------------------------
To install IntFiltr, complete the following steps:

(a) Copy intfiltr.sys to your %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers directory.
      [intfiltr.sys is located in the \Install subdirectory of this package]
(b) Update your registry to include the changes listed in intfiltr.reg
      To make these changes, you can just run 'regedit intfiltr.reg'.
      [intfiltr.reg is located in the \Install subdirectory of this package]
  

2. Configuring the IntFiltr
---------------------------
To configure IntFiltr, run intfiltr.exe (located in the \Config 
subdirectory of this package).  

First, highlight a device in the 'Devices' listbox.  Then you can use the 
'Add Filter' and 'Remove Filter' buttons to turn interrupt filtering on 
and off, respectively, for the selected device.  When IntFiltr is 
installed on a device, the string "InterruptAffinityFilter" will appear 
in the 'Upper Filters' listbox.  

You can use the 'Set Mask' button to set the CPU-affinity for the selected 
device's interrupts, or you can use the 'Delete Mask' button to remove a 
device's CPU-affinity mask from the registry.  Beware that if no 
CPU-affinity mask exists for a device, installing IntFiltr on a 
device will have no useful effect.  

The button marked "Don't Restart Device When Making Changes" is intended 
for advanced users.  You can use this button to change a device's filter 
settings without restarting the selected device.  Note that while this 
button is checked, any change you make will not take effect until the next 
time the device is restarted (which will usually not occur until the next 
reboot).  

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Although _all_ the machine's devices will appear in the 
'Devices' list, it only makes sense to install IntFiltr on top of devices 
that have interrupt resources.  To see which devices have interrupt 
resources, you can go into Device Manager and select View -> Resources By 
Type.

ThisThe HAL enables Machine Check Exception (MCE) reporting for all implementation defined errors.  2. Intel Pentium  Pro Processor Machine Check The mMachine cCheckl eException (MCE)MCE is processor exception 0x18h. The handler for Machine Check Exception is implemented as a task gate for maximum reliability of the exception handler..  The HAL provides a generic exception handler for all errors that cause an exception.  This handler reports the machine check exception code on the screen and causes the operating system to halt gracefully, reducing the possibility of persistent data corruption. In addition, the HAL also provides MCA specific interface that can be used by drivers to :to: rRead the MCA banks to detect anny error that diddoes not generate an exceptionMCE. One case where an error does not generate an any exception is if the bit controlling reporting of the machine check error for a specific bank (MCi_CTL.Eej) bit is turned offcleared. There are also some restartable errors that don t generate Machine Check Exception and are logged in the MCA banks. getObtain control (to possibly log errors to NVRAM) when the Machine Check exception handler getsis invoked by providing two callback routines - ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback Machine Check Exception Handling If the MCA exception handler detects only Intel Pentium  technology (style) MCE support on the platform, it does the following: If a MCA driver is registered with the HAL, call the MCA driver ExceptionCallback function providing the contents of P5_MC_ADDR and P5_MC_TYPE register values. This callback routine can log the register values in NVRAM and return. Call KeBugCheckEx() with the following 4 parameters to halt the system  Low  32 bits of P5_MC_TYPE MSR Always zero High 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR Low 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR Maybe we should describe the format of the bugcheck output on the screen? If MCA support (Pentium Pro processor) on the platform is detected, the exception handler determineschecks if the error is restartable. If not, it does the following: call the MCA Driver ExceptionCallback routine to give the MCA driver a chance to log the errors in NVRAM call KeBugCheckEx() with the following 4 parameters  to halt the system.  MCA Bank number that generated Machine Check exception Address field from MCi_ADDR MSR for this MCA bank High 32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for this MCA bank Low 32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for this MCA bank If the error is restartable, the exception handler requests the timer tick routine to queues a DPC which when called will reports the MCA bank error to the MCA Driver through the DpcCallback routine. 3. Intel Itanium  Processor Machine Check Machines checks, including Machine Check Aborts cause IA64 processor execution to vector to the Processor Abstraction Layer (PAL) PALE_CHECK code in the IA64 ISA.   HYPERLINK ""  When PALE_CHECK has finished processing, it passes control to the System Abstraction Layer (SAL) SAL_ENTRY code in the IA64 ISA, which in turn branches to the SAL MCA handler: SAL_CHECK.  Uncorrected machine checks refer to errors that cannot be corrected at PAL or SAL layers. These may still be fully or partially recoverable at the OS layer.  At that time, the control flow differs between corrected and uncorrected machine checks.  For corrected machine checks, the OS corrected error interrupt handlers will be invoked some time after returning to the interrupted process.  For uncorrected machine checks, SAL exposes an interface to register an OS_MCA callback. After validating this entry point, SAL_CHECK branches to it and provides the necessary information and conditionan Error Record that willo allow the OS to recover whenever possible. The amount of state information savedError Record passed by SAL is implementation-dependentmust comply, at a minimum, with the V3.0 SAL specification (January 2001), Appendix B,  Error Record Structures . The, implying that the HAL had to exposes interfaces for the OEMs to register a driver, and provides the Error Record to the driver. This enables the OEMs to assist  MCA handlers and to provide valid state information to these handlers so these might help the generic HAL MCA handler by attempting recovery of platform specific errors and maintaining the integrity of the platform.  For IA64 PAL, SAL and OS MCA handler s details, please refer to  HYPERLINK "http://www.intel.com/design/ia-64/manuals"  http://www.intel.com/design/ia-64/manuals TIn addition, the IA64 Reference HAL provides an MCA specific interface that can be used by drivers to: Register for delivery of an ExceptionCallback during non-corrected error processing. This callback returns an error severity value to the standard HAL OS_MCA, allowing OEM error recovery. The driver also registers a DpcCallback, which will be performed should the driver recover during ExceptionCallback processing. Register for delivery of two additional DpcCallback. These are delivered during corrected error processing for CPU Corrected errors and/or Platform corrected errors. Read the Error Records during DpcCallback processing.Read the MCA logs Obtain control when the Machine Check exception handler is invoked by providing two callback routines - ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback. The ExceptionCallback has also the capability of returning an error severity value to the standard HAL OS_MCA path to hint this path to continue or halt gracefully the platform. Machine Check Exception Handling After collecting the MCA log, the standard HAL MCA handler calls the MCA driver ExceptionCallback function providing the MCA record. This allows the MCA driver to process the log and makes appropriate consideration with regards to the stability of the system. This callback function returns to an error severity value to let the HAL know if it should consider the event as fatal, recoverable or corrected by the MCA driver. In case of a corrected event and if registered, the MCA driver DpcCallback is then called for asynchronous log collection by the driver. In case of an OS_MCA uncorrected event, the HAL calls KeBugCheckEx( ) with the bugcheck code MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION and the following 4 parameters to halt the system HAL IA64 MCA type, which values could be:  HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_ASSERT = 1, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_GET_STATEINFO  = 2, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_CLEAR_STATEINFO = 3, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_FATAL = 4.  This last value should be the expected one for the MCA driver, the other values being HAL internal error values. MCA log address MCA maximum log size SAL status of the last SAL interface. MCA INTERFACE FOR DRIVERS The Intel generic HalALs provides the following Intel Pentium  Pro and Itanium technology  MCA specific interface for drivers: HalSetSystemInformation with the HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to as HalMcaRegisterDriver.  This allows a driver  to register MCA driver callbacks with the HAL. Additionally the Itanium driver may use a HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to HalCmcRegisterDriver or HalCpeRegisterDriver for delivery of Corrected CPU errors (CMC) and Corrected Platform Errors (CPE). HalQuerySystemInformation with the HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set toas HalMcaLogInformation.  This allows thea driver to read the MCA bank log. Additionally the Itanium driver may use a HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to HalCmcLogInformation or HalCpeLogInformation to read MCA logs from Corrected CPU errors (CMC) and/or Corrected Platform Errors (CPE). 243.1 HalSetSystemInformation to register MCA Driver NTSTATUS  HalSetSystemInformation( IN HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG  BufferSize, OUT PVOID  Buffer, HalSetSystemInformation can be used to register MCA driver with the HAL Parameters InformationClass : Specify HalMcaRegisterDriver to register MCA driver s callback routines with the HAL. There are two callback routines- ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback routine. The ExceptionCallback Routine is called duringwhen the Machine Check Exception handlera non-restartable error is processingfound by the Machine Check Exception handler and it is going to , before it bugchecks the system. The DpcCallback routine is called for when the MCA error is restartable. For Itanium systems, specify  HalCmcRegisterDriver to register a driver s Corrected CPU Error DpcCallback routine, and HalCpeRegisterDriver to register a driver s Corrected Platform Error DpcCallback. errors that generated the Machine Check Exception.

The only thing driver is allowed to do at that point is to log the information in NVRAM.  A driver explicitly may not utilize any kernel services or spinlock routines.  The handler is restricted to the same constraints as a driver operating at highest IRQL. DpcCallback is athe driver supplieddriver-supplied routine that getsis called for restartable errrors that caused Machine Check Exception. This routine will be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL. (Comment:  Restartable errors, by definition, do not cause MCE) DeviceContext is the Device specific context for this MCA Driver. Include ntddk.h Return Value HalSetSystemInformation returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the registration is successful. Comments HalSetSystemInformation must be called before any of the other interface routines can be used by a MCA drivera MCA driver can use any of the other interface routines. Only one MCA driver can be registered with the HAL at any time. The exception callback routine or the DPC callback routine parameters cannot be NULL.. 243.2 HalQuerySystemInformation to get MCA bank logs NTSTATUS  HalQuerySystemInformation( IN HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG  BufferSize, OUT PVOID  Buffer, OUT PULONG  ReturnedLength HalQuerySystemInformation can be used to read MCA banks status registers Parameters InformationClass : Specify HalMcaLogInformation to read the current MCA error reporting banks log.

MERGEFORMAT  RIS Support for Headless Introduction Feature Summary This spec covers new features for the Remote Installation Service (RIS) that help with headless operation. Put your feature summary here.  It should be understandable by someone who is not intimately knowledgeable about your feature area.  The summary will be used to communicate your feature to marketing, the field, etc.Items for RIS that help headless: RIS support for server installs   currently only Windows 2000 professional can be installed with RIS Unique.udb processing in binl   allows more control over the answerfile processing for an RIS install RIS support for the recovery console   allows access to network files from the recovery console The recovery console is normally selected at the beginning of textmode setup by typing R, then C when prompted. This change also allows the recovery console to be selected directly from the RIS Client Installation Wizard. Theme Relevance How does your feature relate to the overall platform themes and the individual product themes? <placeholder  when the theme documents are finished a pointer will be placed here>This will help manageability of headless servers in an RIS environment by making it easier to install and repair them. Customer Scenarios Include the details of which customer scenarios this features addresses (see customer scenarios in product theme documents).  Whose problems does this feature solve? Remember customers can be end users, IT pros, BDMs, IHV s, ISV s, OEM s, Service Providers, VAP s, etc. One scenario is a machine that the admin wants to simply wipe clean and reinstall. Allowing RIS to install the server build makes this simple on a headless machine. Another scenario is an environment where the admin wants to have slightly different answerfiles for installation on different machines, while still installing the same build. The unique.udb support in BINL allows this to be done easily, just like it is today with the unique.udb support in winnt. Finally, if an admin wishes to transfer files between the machine and another machine on the network in the recovery console, he can do so. The recovery console is useful for replacing files but currently requires physical access to the machine to put a floppy or CD-ROM in. Allowing network access removes this restriction and makes the recovery console much more useful in the headless scenario. Justification Business Justification Why should this feature be in the product?  What business opportunities will it exploit?   This is the most efficient way to do preinstall on EFI systems and those will be likely headless candidates.  The amount of customer value is high vs. the amount of risk and dev impact. Competitive Justification What are our competitors doing in this area?  What must we do to have a competitive offering?This is part of increasing our headless support. Our competitors that support remote installs will be able to sell against us if we don t support remote installs of servers, the main headless market.  Currently SUN offers Jump Start support which is comparable functionality. Customer Justification What percentage of customers will use, need or be affected by this feature (list your data source)?  What customers have you talked to that will use this feature? Tier  3 support engineers, preinstall/install engineers and OEM preinstall engineers will be the key customers. Industry Impact What changes will this feature cause in the industry (from an IHV, OEM, ISV standpoint)?  Or, what changes in the industry are causing this change? OEMs will ship more servers (and likely all IA64 servers) with PXE capable NICs. Technical Justification Why was this particular implementation chosen over other options?  What other options were considered? It fit tightly within current RIS tools and the overall headless design. Goals To provide RIS support via OoB headless management channel (a serial port in rev 1) Non Goals Anything beyond the above goals. Scope What does this spec cover This spec covers changes to the RIS components and the BINL server components to provide headless RIS functionality on server. What this spec doesn t cover Anything else. Related Documents If there are other documents that one should read to fully understand this feature, please include them here.Headless EMS spec. Feature Description Detailed Feature Description and Specification Put your full description of how your feature functions here.- Support for remote installs of server builds The only code change required for this is to remove an intentional block against it that was put in the risetup code (the app that puts an image on the remote install server for other machines to download). This code checks the [SetupData].ProductType value in the txtsetup.sif file, if it is not  , it prevents the install. There is already an MS-internal KB article  Q214794 How to Create Remote Installation Share for Windows 2000 Server , that details how to workaround this by hacking the ProductType to be 0, running risetup, then changing the ProductType back once the image is on the server. The only reason RIS server installs were not support in Windows 2000 was the testing resources required. Unique.udb support in BINL Currently, winnt supports a hidden parameter that allows you to specify an overlay on top of your answerfile. The syntax is as follows: winnt /u:unattend.txt /udf:myBasic,unique.udb which would assume an original unattend.txt file with a line such as: [UserData]   ComputerName =  unknown and then lines in unique.udb such as:  [UniqueIds]    myBasic = UserData; [myBasic:UserData]   ComputerName = "myBasic" The overlay uses the UniqueIds section to look up the unique.udb name specified by /udf: ( myBasic  in this case), then finds which sections it has overlay information for.(only  UserData  in this example). It then overlays the values, so that the final [UserData] section in the answerfile species  ComputerName =  myBasic . This allows the admin to keep most of the values in the answerfile unchanged, but still flexibly have some values that are modified based on the /udf: value. In addition, the same unique.udb file can be used to modify different answerfiles. BINL is the service that runs on the remote install server and communicates with the Client Installation Wizard. The client screens can specify variables that the user can fill in, which are then sent to the server. Some of these have special meaning to BINL. To support unique.udb processing in BINL, the variable UNIQUEUDBID is defined to have a special value, that of the /udf name ( myBasic  in the example above. The overlay file name defaults to unique.udb, but this can be overridden by specifying a UniqueUdbFile value in the [OSChooser] section of the .sif that the admin has set up on the remote install server to identify this build to users of the Client Installation Wizard. Thus, the admin can add a screen to ask the user for a UNIQUEUDBID value, or can create a menu of values which more elaborate descriptions. He can also control which unique.udb file is used to overlay the answerfile. RIS support for the recovery console The recovery console can be added as a choice in the  Maintenance and Troubleshooting  menu presented in the Client Installation Wizard. To set this up on the server, the admin goes to an existing RIS install that has been set up, copies the .sif file to a new name, and changes the ImageType from  CMDCONS  (he may also modify the description, name, and any other fields). If the user selects this option, the system reboots to the command console, without having to type R, then C as they usually do when selecting the recovery console from a straight CD boot. In addition, once the recovery console is running, the user can assign a drive letter to a network share, using NET USE command. This is the help text for NET USE: Use NET USE to Map a network share point to a drive letter. NET USE [\\server-name\share-name /USER:domain-name\user-name [password]           |   drive-letter: /d server-name             The server that you wish to connect to. share-name              The share that you wish to connect to. domain-name             The domain to use when validating the                          credentials for user-name. user-name               The user within domain-name to use for                          connecting to \\server-name\share-name. password                You may, optionally, enter the password on the                          command line. Note:                   NET USE will prompt for the password if it is                          not on the command line and will automatically  assign a drive letter to the connection if it  successfully connects. drive-letter            The drive letter that NET USE as assigned to a                         server connection. /d                      Indicates that this connection is to be disconnected. WesW has made similar changes on his machine to support the NET USE command and network access on a machine that was not booted off the RIS server (our changes only work if the machine was booted off an RIS server). It would be good if those changes were checked in also, but that is beyond the scope of this document.  HYPERLINK   UI Description What functions are exposed to the user.  What does each function do?  How is it exposed to the user?  Include screen shots and mock ups where appropriate.  It may be useful to use a format where you describe the user action and then describe what takes place based on that action. RIS support for headless has no user input. The admin can control how the unique.udb selection is presented to the user. An admin can also control how the user selects the recovery console from BINL, and the recovery console itself is the same except for the additional NET USE command, documented in the previous section. What are the top 5 usability issues you re going to solve? t use RIS to install any server builds Admin needs to maintain too many .sifs to allow easy reinstall of a specific server or class of servers Admin can t localize all the machine-specific answerfile settings in a single place User has to sit through setup and hit two keys at the right time to invoke the recovery console right now Without network support, usefulness of recovery console on a headless machine is limited. Make sure you don t forget the CUI   every GUI feature should also have a character user interface.  See also   scripting interfaces section. API and Interfaces Describe all APIs and Interfaces used in this feature.  Be sure to note which are internal and which are public APIs.  The SDK team will use this section to update their list of APIs. New APIs and Interfaces List all APIs and interfaces that have not been used before.An IOCTL was added to the redirector so that the recovery console can notify it to use kernel-mode security routines instead of the standard user-mode ones (since user-mode is not around when the recovery console is running). This is the same thing that was done for the redirector when copying files during an RIS install. Changed APIs and Interfaces None. List all APIs and interfaces that have been changed in some way.  Does this have the possibility of breaking backward compatibility? Removed APIs and Interfaces List all APIs that have been removed or otherwise disabled.  Are you sure you understand the full impact of this change?None. Scripting Interfaces Anything a user can do should be scriptable.

Think about who has to sign up to do work   test, design, etc. Code Dependencies Note: You may not incorporate Open Source Software into Microsoft Products. Do you depend on code from another component?  Do you need to license code from a third party, who drops it, how do they do it?  Who is handling the licensing?  Make sure to note which files come from third parties in the file list portions of this doc (2.3 & 2.4). How do your dependencies get updated?  How do updates get tested with your code? Scenario Dependencies What other features need to succeed in order for your scenarios to succeed?  What do other teams/partners (could be ISV s, IHV s, etc.) need to do for your scenarios to succeed? General headless support.   OEMs to provide NICs that support PXE cards. A solid EFI PXE implimentation. Win64 Issues List any issues you have with being completely 64 bit here. Support for RIS on Win64 is up in the air, the spec is very incomplete and no hardware is in sight. However once the base RIS work is done to support Win64, we should work fine, since the specific work we are doing here should be independent of that (risetup.exe and binlsvc.dll run on the server anyway, and spcmdcons.sys does not have any machine-specific code that we care about). Localization/Globalization Issues Accessibility Issues Compatibility Hardware Compatibility Is there any possibility that this will break backward compatibility with devices and other hardware? Application/Component Compatibility How will this feature affect application compatibility?  This could mean a shrink wrapped application, and ISV app, a LOB app or simply a service or component.  If you are breaking something, how will you address the issue with ISVs, other internal groups, etc.? Heterogeneous Network Compatibility Is this feature compatible with a heterogeneous network (older NT systems, Win9x machines).  What are the limitations of this feature in such an environment? Backup Steve Olsson will provide some content. Does this feature use a private data store?  If so, how does it get backed up? Reliability Issues Does your feature require new code in the kernel?  If so, are you exposing interfaces where 3rd parties can write kernel mode code?  Why isn t this in user mode? Yes, spcmdcon.sys is in the kernel, but that is how it was designed. User-mode is not around in that environment. What options require this feature to reboot the system?  Why? (you shouldn t be rebooting the system!) None. URL requirements Does this feature require links to Microsoft.com or other web sites?  Where do those links exist in your feature? If you intend to link to an existing MS web site, you will need to use a redirector URL.  See   HYPERLINK "http://winweb/features/whyregister.asp"  http://winweb/features/whyregister.asp  for more instructions on how to obtain your redir URL.  You need to contact   HYPERLINK "mailto:emilyw"  mailto:emilyw  if you intent to add any content to Microsoft.com a develop a plan for creating and maintaining that content. Describe your plan for developing and maintaining your web content here. Supportability New features should typically be self supporting if at all possible - meaning that they are able to provide appropriate status, diagnostic and or self-repair information without requiring add-on tools from a resource kit.  Describe how your feature can 1) help users solve their own problems, and 2) how it can minimize the time during a PSS support call by providing quick access to relevant status and configuration information about both the feature itself and the environment for which it s configured. Logging/Eventing What does this feature log, when does it log it, and what is useful about it? Error Messages What are you going to do to improve the error messages in this feature? Diagnostic Tools If applicable, what other diagnostic tools are available for this feature? Recovery from Corruption or Error Conditions If an error condition or corruption occurs, how can the user recover and how can they track down what caused it? User Assistance Issues Identify your user assistance contact for documenting your feature. You are responsible for reviewing for technical accuracy.

Information Exposure What parts of this project do we expect to expose outside of Microsoft?  What should be exposed in the DDK, SDK, Consortium Specs and Papers. What will remain strictly proprietary? High Level Test Plan Test strategy The Test Strategy is similar to the planning that goes into a product. Test Strategy describes the plan for implementing the testing effort on a component/subsystem to expose bugs prior to shipping. Exposing bugs can be done in several ways depending on the component/subsystem under test.  The information presented here is somewhat generic and may not apply to every test strategy document.  Functionality Functionality tests are API level kinds of test that verify the component works in the specified manner. The tests include verifying known good data as well as bad data and error conditions.  Regression Regression tests include functionality tests, setup variations, manual variations, and any other tests that are run on a regular basis.  Stress Stress tests are those test that are entered into the NT stress mix, IO Stress mix, or run as stress in a particular lab. Stress tests don t typically produce test results other than the tests were run for some period of time and the machine under test didn t crash.  Setup/Upgrade Setup tests need to verify that the component behaves as expected in all setup and upgrade scenarios. Interop The test strategy needs to describe how the component/subsystem under test will interact with other parts of the system and/or other systems. Interop test plan will include information on the tests that need to be run to determine that everything will play well together for the customer.  Reliability Test strategy needs to describe how reliability of the component/subsystem will be measured. This is typically accomplished using deployment and long haul servers.  Robustness Driver verifier, IO Verifier, and fault injection and test suites to expose robustness bugs in the component/subsystem.  Long haul This normally applies to services in the system. Long haul requirements are created by determining the amount of activity expected on a system over a period of time. Create test scenarios that simulate that activity in as short a time as possible. The system should not be overloaded to the point of stressing the system. But the tests should make maximum use of available resources to execute the test run in as short a time as possible. Measurement systems will vary depending on the component, e.g. transactions per second, bytes per second, connections per minute, etc.  Deployment Describe how the component/subsystem is going to be deployed in real life environment.  Test should cover various deployment scenarios (OEM, corp, VAR, etc.)  This will continue to remain a critical test concern even into the next century.  Globalization All test strategies and test plans must include information describing plan to support globalization of test execution.  Geopolitical All components should test for geopolitical correctness. Automation Wherever possible tests should be automated to provide best coverage and lowest cost. This makes it easy to setup, execute, and log test results quickly and efficiently. Automation can be done using scripts, executables, Visual Test, etc.  WHQL Deliverables If your testing includes hardware components then the test strategy should include documentation for the test program and meet WHQL requirements to ship on test CDs.  Ship criteria The quality bar for the component/subsystem under test needs to be established for each ship milestone. Ship Criteria defines the minimum acceptable pass rates for tests in order to ship. This is the measurement to determine whether the component is ready to ship to customers. Each of the areas of the test strategy must have criteria associated with it to quantify ship expectations.  For example, regression tests must pass > 99% with no serious issues in any area. Tests must be run on previous 10 builds.  Test Results Test results must be reported in a consistent manner. Where and when will you report your results?  What format will they take? Schedule/Staffing Staffing This work will be done by Adam Barr, Sada Rajaram, and Sean Selitrennikoff.Describe the staffing requirements you have to meet the schedule below.

remotely and therefore does not require local keyboard, mouse or video card and monitor.  This specification documents the first headless implementation of Windows, called the Emergency Management Services, EMS, and the removal of dependencies on local console hardware and the ability to run Attended in Text Mode Setup with Unattended GUI Mode Setup.   Windows has remote management capabilities that provide the necessary tools to administer the operating system remotely when the OS is functioning properly.  For further discussion of these tools see 1.5.2  What this spec does not cover The purpose of the EMS is to provide a highly reliable back door to a server for use when the server cannot be managed via the normal means.   This back door is really conglomeration of multiple binaries that all use the RedPort for a console device and provide capabilities aimed at getting the OS up and fully functional. The normal means of communications, generally the network, is called the  in band  communication channel.  Communication that does not require the in band communication to be available is called  out of band , or OoB. Out of band management is necessary is when the OS is not running, the OS is not running properly or the link to the in band communication channel is unavailable.   Examples of situations where out of band management is required: - the in band network is unavailable - the network stack has failed - no general purpose network stack is available, e.g. RIS, setup, the loader, blue screen - the server is extremely low on resources, possibly due to a runaway application. The goal of all communication with the EMS is to attempt to return the server to a state where the OS is functioning and normal in band tools are available.  Since some states and situations, like certain system hangs, are impossible to remedy with a software solution, out of band support for management hardware is key to creating a bullet proof headless solution.  When our headless solution is coupled with properly designed hardware and firmware, a system could be entirely managed remotely even when the OS is completely unavailable.  A white paper <How to build complimentary HW for Microsoft Headless Operating systems> will be available to aid OEMs in creating systems that integrate well with our headless OS support. The functionality of the EMS is limited to text mode communication.  In order to run setup in a non-automated way, all input that is currently required in setup must be completed in text mode setup.  This will allow Windows setup to be competed remotely via the out of band channel.  However any remote access to setup files will be through standard in band mechanisms or PXE. Note:  The hardware interface that provides in band communication is sometimes referred to as GreenPort.  The hardware interface that provides the out of band management channel is called the RedPort.  Since it is only used when all other mechanisms have been exhausted, the RedPort must be highly reliable.  Because much of the code that accesses the RedPort is limited in size and complexity the RedPort interface must be simple and uniform across vendors.  This first Windows EMS support will be available via a serial port. It is possible that in future implementations of hardware the RedPort and GreenPort may share the same external physical connector outside the headless server, i.e. a single net card providing both functionalities.  Clearly this lowers the reliability of the out of band management channel. Theme Relevance A headless server provides increased manageability and availability.  These two areas and scalability are the key areas that we need to improve to compete in the server space.  Customers have been asking for these features since NT4.0 was released. <placeholder  when the theme documents are finished a pointer will be placed here> Customer Scenarios The reasons that a typical customer would choose to run a server headless would be to  Scenario 1   A real customer incident: NatWest Bank in June (or thereabouts) of 1998. The domain controllers on their NT4 network hit 100% CPU utilization and users could not log in. If a DC was restarted, it immediately went back to 100% CPU utilization due to network requests. There was no way for an administrator, even if he was sitting at the machine, to break in, and certainly no way to do so remotely.  This brought NatWest s data center to its knees.   Using the headless capabilities provided by the EMS the NatWest administrators likely could have diagnosed and rectified the problem.  Using the Tlist functionality of the SAC , the admin could have determined which process was consuming 100% of the CPU cycles.  They then could use the Lower Priority functionality to wrangle the offending process, thus returning their server a usable state. Scenario 2   An admin ships a Server, with a known MAC address and PXE compatible NIC, to his server farm with no software installed.  There, a local technician plugs in the power cable, the serial cable and the network cable(s), calls in to the administrator, powers on the box and walks away.  The serial port is connected to a terminal concentrator.  Using telnet to connect to the terminal concentrator, the administrator is viewing the box boot via the out of band connection remotely.  The data center has been setup up to support Remote Install Services (RIS) for installs. When the StartROM.com prompts for F12 (the BINL server has been properly configured to set this server up with the proper configuration) she presses F12.  She then selects the appropriate OS from the list of possible choices and returns to her other jobs.  A few minutes later she returns to watch the status scroll by as the server continues to setup.  When she checks back a few hours later the server has completed setup and fully functional.  She pings the server and to make sure is available and logs the server as setup. With proper automation software on the administrator s computer this process could be automated.  Note: the work to create such automated tools is not work outlined in the spec. Scenario 3   A technician goes on site to diagnose system that is failing to even begin to load the operating system because of a disk problem.  When he arrives he attaches his laptop the serial port as a console.  He determines the problem and replaces the HD with an blank one.     Then he inserts the retail Windows SKU and boots to CD.  From there he uses the Attended Text Mode to Unattended GUI Mode Setup functionality to load Windows on the HD.  Now that the system is back up and running, a remote admin configures the system appropriately.  Justification Business Justification Systems that are remotely managed, groups of systems that are being centrally managed, partitionable systems and embedded devices all require headless support.  This feature is necessary to lower Total Cost of Ownership for our server products.  It is a checkbox feature for server products.  It will allow us to compete with SUN and Unix vendor in the server space.  This server space is the lowest tier of computing that Windows does not dominate.   Competitive Justification Nearly all Unix competitors support headless.  SUN has been particularly vocal about this lack of functionality.  Midrange SUN UE servers all support Out of Band via a serial port connection.  Unix vendors, such as IBM and HP, support out of band management via the serial port and network.  This is a real world differentiation that customers base their purchases on.  Customer Justification System administrators for data centers, branch offices, highly available systems, telcos and ISP s have requested the feature specifically.  The feature is particularly popular with customers who are used to similar functionality on Unix.  Customers also can reduce cabling and rack space by eliminating the KVM switches they currently use.  Some customers who we have visited and wish to use the feature are   HYPERLINK "http://www.loudcloud.com"  www.loudcloud.com , Goldman Sachs, HotMail, GNAC and Lehman Bros.  Numerous customer visitors have demonstrated the customer want and need of this feature. Industry Impact Competitors are likely to improve their out of band management to try to maintain a competitive advantage.   Hardware vendors will change their designs to better support our headless servers.   Hardware vendors will  - improve the out of band management available on there servers by adding features to there current out band solutions. - change their current out of band management implementations to match and compliment our functionality. - add out of band management functionality to servers that previously had none. - spoof serial ports to provide customers with the ability to reach the EMS via other mechanisms such as the network. ISVs and OEMs, who supply management software, will add support for the this new management technology to their current management offerings by integrating VT100+ compatible terminals and tools for aggregation and automation.  Good implementations here would help customers significantly.  KVM switches will become less popular. Technical Justification Hardware support: Serial ports are on 100% of current PC servers.   It is the way many competive solutions are implimented.   A large segment of the current customer base has a serial based infrastructure for their current headless implementations.  Further more, many customers were demanding interoperability with their Unix solutions.     Because of the well-understood and simple interface the serial port offered the fastest time to market for a robust implementation.  Because of customer s dire need for headless support, our current ship schedule and our need to get real world experience feedback, on a feature we have never supported before, time to market was a key factor.  Because legacy reduction is a goal, and the serial port is considered legacy, there were other options for hardware we considered and we may support them in the future, such as Network, 1394, PXE and Service Processor.   Eventually the RedPort will be something other than serial on many if not all systems. Software architecture: Given our goal of Unix interoperability, high reliability and delivery in the next rev of windows it was a relatively easy decision.  This architecture was the one the most closely matched with the current implementation of Windows and most specifically the sensitive and well tested windows boot, initialization, blue screen code and debugger.  Other choices would have required drastic changes to the windows architecture itself, specifically in areas, which are highly constrained and very sensitive to change, such as the loader.  This was fastest, simplest and safest way we could implement headless support that would meet customer needs for functionality and interoperability.   Goals The general goal of headless is to provide a mechanism to manage all aspects of the server remotely and therefore not require any local keyboard, mouse or video.  Of course adding and replacing hardware will require local access.  To do this you must manage all states of the machine not just the OS state. The work being done to enable headless operation assumes currently available tools, such as MMC snap-ins or Terminal Server Administrator Mode, are to be used to manage the OS remotely via the standard communication channels, such as Ethernet.  The headless directive is to manage the system in all other systems states and the OS state only in emergencies.   There are states, including Power Off, Firmware and sometimes Hung (hung in the diagram actually represents many situations where the server is unresponsive to access via an in band connection, some of which are correctable using the SAC), where there is no Microsoft software running on the headless system.  Managing these states requires that the OEM/BIOS vendor support out of band management.  It is obviously preferable that the OEM solution uses the same protocol (VT100 or <VT100+>) and channel as the Microsoft headless solution, so that users can access both using one set of cables and tools.  Furthermore it is valuable to the customer to have uniformity across OEMs so that managing systems from multiple vendors would be simplified. Non Goals General Remote Management   While general remote management is key for Windows to competitive in the server market place, work beyond what is currently available is not required for headless operation.  It is outside the scope of this document.  Work done to enable headless operation will be with the intention of fitting into the overall remote management picture.   Replacing in-band management capabilities.  The goal of headless support is always to return to the OS state and manage the system using in-band methods. Aggregation   Aggregation is the ability to view multiple systems simultaneously at a given instant through a single user interface.  Aggregation is subcategory of the larger remote management category of work. Automation   Automation is the ability act and react without human intervention.  The simplest form of automation is scripting, but it would extend to intelligently reacting to events as they happen and predicting outcomes etc.  Automation is subcategory of the larger remote management category of work. Note:  Headless implementations must be exposed in ways that allow automation and aggregation but the actual aggregation and automation will be accomplished via management tools on a remote administration machines not the target headless system. Scope What does this spec cover The EMS Components StartROM.com OSChooser NTLDR Recovery Console Setup Blue Screen Attended Text Mode Setup, Unattended GUI Mode Setup What this spec doesn t cover Lights Out Servers   Although headless is a requirement for a lights out server, the term lights out server has a greater scope than just headless.  Lights out implies a certain level or reliability, availability, manageability and automation that are not inherent requirements for headless operation.  The work done in headless is with the intention of integrating as part of a light out server in a lights out data center. Removal of the Windows video card requirement.

The EMS is available whenever possible when Windows software is running system.  With the exception of the Secure Admin Console, which is a kernel mode driver that s only function is headless support, all portions of the EMS are standard Windows components that have had headless functionality added to them. Note that with the exception of StartROM.com and the SAC, there are not separate headless and non-headless versions of the EMS components.  They are simply configured by default to run headless or not. There are certain periods, generally during state transitions when one component is exiting and next is initializing, where the EMS is not available.  The goal is to minimize these  black out  periods as much as possible.  There are also areas during redirection where only status is being transferred and there is no interaction.  These  gray out  areas become interactive, if the EMS component executing errors out and supports a !SAC.  A !SAC is a console that becomes available it the system errors out, during one of the states that supports it, and offers a paired down set of the commands available in the SAC.    Setup   Setup itself can be run headless in three ways: Unattend,  Attended Text Mode Setup with Unattened GUI Mode Setup or using Remote Install Services.  Note: see section 2.2  Setup Requirements  for details on how to configure the final Windows installation to run headless during setup.   In all 3 modes, SetupLDR is executed.  If there is an answer file, SetupLDR will  use  the configuration specified in it.  In the case where there is an Answer File, but there is no headless section SetupLDR will not direct its UI to the RedPort.   If setup loader is not run with an answer file, but is launched by OSChooser, setup will use the same settings as OSChooser.  If SetupLDR is being run without an answer file, and the BIOS conforms to <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management> spec, it will use the settings the BIOS used for RedPort console I/O, other wise it will not redirect.  In the case where the BIOS settings are used because there is no Answer File and no settings are passed from OSChooser, text mode setup will prompt the user before its completion as to whether or not it should continue to redirect using the BIOS settings when the OS is installed. Unattended Text Mode setup   Setup can be configured to run headless via an Answer File.  The text mode portion of setup will run unattended and provide status to the RedPort. With the exception of a RIS  install, SetupLDR will read it s settings from the boot.ini, which will have been determined from the Setup.SIF unattend file. In an RIS install SetupLDR will use the settings passed by OSChooser.  Text mode setup will use the same RedPort settings that SetupLDR used.  See section 2.2  Setup Requirements  for details on writing the Setup.SIF file appropriately.   The GUI mode portion of setup must run in an unattended mode, as any pop ups will not be directed out the RedPort console.  This may be achieved via an Unattend file or Attended Text Mode Setup, Unattended GUI Mode Setup The SAC is enabled during GUI Mode setup. Attended Text Mode Setup, Unattended GUI Mode Setup   All the information necessary to complete setup is entered during a series of text mode dialogs during Text Mode Setup that create an answer file which allows the GUI mode part of setup that would typically require user interaction to run hands free.   Any time Text Mode Setup is running headless without an Answer File, Attended Text Mode Setup, Unattended GUI Mode Setup will automatically run.  It is unlikely that this will be the optimum method to setup a system or particularly a group of servers, but it would be very userful when a one off install is needed, particularly when combined with El Toritto (CD/DVD boot) and BIOSes that comply with <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management>.  These technologies will allow boot heedless using only a standard Windows SKU. Remote Installation Services   A RIS install can be run headless.  StartROM.com and OSChooser both run headless.  The BINL server creates an Answer File which allows the rest of setup to run headless.   StartROM.com   Because of the lack of ability to pass perameters to StartROM.com there are four varieties of it, three of which have headless capabilities.  The possible Headless configurations are:  Use BIOS Settings   (see section 2.3  Hardware/Environment Requirements One of the four variations of StartROM.com is configured on the BINL server to be downloaded to each server.  If configured for headless use, StartROM.com directs all of its UI to both the RedPort and the local console, if it exists.  See the note below  Note on EFI dependencies OSChooser   If StartROM.com was running in a Headless mode OSChooser directs all of its UI to both the local console, if it exists, and the RedPort with the same settings as StartROM.com.  See the note below  Note on EFI dependencies Note: There is separate specification for changes to RIS to support server installs appropriately, <RIS on Server Spec>. Recovery Console   When the Recovery Console is configured for headless operation, it directs all of its UI to both the RedPort and the local console, if it exists.  The Recovery Console may be launched in 4 ways.  If the recovery console is launched from setup on the Windows Setup CD/DVD, its redirection settings are determined by those passed from SetupLDR s.  If the Recovery Console is launched via key press from OSLoader, its redirection settings are determined by those passed from OSLoader (boot.ini? pressing F1 or F2?).  If the Recovery Console is installed as a separate OS on the local hard drive, its redirection settings are determined by those associated with it in the boot.ini.  If the Recovery Console is launched from OSChooser, its redirection settings are determined by those passed from OSChooser.  OSLoader/NTLDR   OSLoader directs all of its UI to both the RedPort as specified in the OSLoader section of the boot.ini and the local console, if such section exists.  If no boot.ini exists, OSLoader will not redirect the resulting error message, unless the BIOS reports the redirection settings using the mechanism specified in <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management>, in which case the error message will be redirected and the option to restart will be presented to the user.    See the note below  Note on EFI dependencies .   As it loads files the OSLoader logs status and events.  The log is a circular buffer stored in memory that can be accessed if an error occurs.  The OSLoader supports a !SAC.  The OSLoader !SAC supports the following commands. Display the GUID (may only be available on EFI systems) Display all log entries, paging is on. Display  this list. restart Restart immediately. Display  this list. See the note below  Note on EFI dependencies Kernel, during initialization,   As initialization progresses, it will log status and events. After the first boot driver, the SAC driver, is loaded the kernel supports the SAC.  .  The settings for the kernel, during initialization, are passed on from NTLDR.  The log is a circular buffer stored in memory that can be accessed if an error occurs.  Some example events: Initializing XXXXXX subsystem Initializing driver XXXXXX Driver XXXXXX intialization successful Driver XXXXXX initialization failed. Secure Admin Cosnsole   The Secure Admin Console, SAC, is a kernel mode driver that presents a Console to allow recovery of a system when the OS is running but the normal mechanisms of managing the system are unavailable.  Its settings are abstracted by the kernel, which provides an interface to the RedPort.  The red port settings are determined by those of NTLDR or SetupLDR.  It offers a set of commands aimed at returning the system to functionality. Command name Command Parameter(s) Action Dump the kernel log. t-list Lists the process and threads currently running. togglet-list format Toggles full tlist info to just processes, or visa-versa. <pid> Kills the given process. lower priority <pid> Lowers the priority of a process to the lowest possible. limit memory <pid>  <MB-allowed> Limits the memory usage of a process to MB-allowed megabytes. toggle t-list paging Toggles paging the display. Returns the System GUID shut down Shutdown Shutdown the machine. raise priority <pid> Raise the priority of a process restart restart Shuts downs and restarts the machine. IP address(es) List all the IP network numbers and their IP addresses set IP address <#> <IP> <sub-net> Sets the IP address for the given network number. time and date Displays the Time Date set time and date <mm/dd/yyyy> <hh:mm> Sets the Time and Date list commands  Lists the available commands. crash dump crashdump Crash the system.  Crash dump must be enabled for a dump to be generated. Blue Screen   In the general case the Blue Screen can be configured to restart or wait and to create a dump file or not.  These settings are not affected if the system is running headless.  All blue screen information and the Date and Time from the headless sytsem is  output via the RedPort. If the server is configured to wait (i.e. not to restart), a prompt for the blue screen !SAC will be available.    The blue screen !SAC supports the following commands Diplay the GUID Display all log entries, paging is on. Display  this list. restart Restart immediately. Display  this list. Note on EFI dependencies:  On systems with EFI compliant firmware, the components that execute while the EFI bootime services are available must use the EFI console for all console I/O.  The EFI console service will appropriately write all output to the RedPort if it is configured to.  Also note: There is no boot.ini.  After EFI_Exit_Firmware is called by NTLDR (or the kernel depending on our EFI implimentation), NTLDR (or the kernel depending on our EFI implimentation) will always use what the console device path returns as the console with the exception of the case where the admin has configured the boot settings in the EFI boot variables for that OS fro no headless redirection.  If the console boot service does not return a serial (or other acceptable RedPort) device path, headless will not be supported on that system. .  If the user wishes to turn off headless support on the serial port, they may do so by configuring the firmware to not use the serial port (or other acceptable RedPort) as a console, provided the EFI firmware supports that configuration, or by specifying redirection off in the NVRAM variables associated with that OS in the EFI boot manager. Boot.Ini settings   The boot.ini contains the settings for OSLoader in a specific section.  Each OS entry in the boot.ini that supports headless operation may contain the configuration information for the appropriate port for the EMS UI with redirect= in the [boot loader] section.  Possible settings are (See the note on 19200 baud): Off   COM1at19200 COM2at19200 UseBIOSSettings see section 2.3  Hardware/Environment Requirements Sample boot.ini [boot loader] timeout=30 default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT redirect=com1 [operating systems] multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional" /fastdetect /redirect Note on the Serial port   There is no logical error correction or error detection provided by the EMS components, such a check sums.   Note on console redirection refresh   There is no support for refreshing the display on the remote screen for those components that redirect text. This is not an issue for the SAC or !SAC, which respond by sending a prompt if an unknown command is issued.   Note on the OS timeouts   We may have to increase certain UI entry timeouts when running headless.  This is because serial latency and the difficulty of entering some non-VT100 supported keys could affect the ability of an admin to enter a command in the time required. Note on the need for hardware   In many cases there is no way for the EMS to provide server, e.g. the system is off, system hangs hard, the HD dies, the admin misses hitting F12 on system with no installed OS or the admin chooses to load a non headless OS)?  In all these cases the EMS alone will not provide a solution, so the ability to control the server using out of band management hardware in conjunction with the EMS is valuable. Note on the 19200 baud   The 19200 settings are provided for backwards compatibility with current Out of Band HW/FW solutions such as the Compaq IRC.  There will not be support for 19200 in StartROM.com.  These solutions typically offer console redirection, so StartROM.com support is not needed. Note on Bootvid.dll   We  do not plan to redirect bootvid.dll output, such as the chkdsk.  We do redirect the blue screen, which utilizes bootvid.dll, but this is done a lever above bootvid.dll. Note on the removal of hardware requirements   The goal of headless is to not require keyboards mice or video hardware.  Currently Windows 2000 supports operation without a mouse, without a keyboard plugged if the bios supports booting without one, without a monitor attached and without a keyboard controller in an ACPI system.  For headless, the requirement for a video card must be eliminated.  This work is not included in this spec.  Although the keyboard, mouse and video hardware are not required on a headless server they may be present. UI Description All the EMS UI is command line based and viewed on a remote terminal.  It would be optimal to make all the UI in each of the EMS components flow together as seamlessly and cohesively as possible.  However, because of the different functions and legacy of the local user interfaces of each state, the interfaces vary in look in feel.   The administrators who use this interface appreciate simplicity and functionality over bells, whistles and pretty pictures.  If customers demand it a more complicated UI that masks the text nature of the EMS can be generated on the administrative machine.  Tools could be created to aggregate and automate management of multiple EMS s.  That functionality is beyond the purview of this doc or the work to be done by Adam s team.  Suffice it to say, any complicated GUI will be generated at the administrative system. From a technical standpoint there are two types of UI presented to the user.  One type is console redirection of text that would appear on the local console.  The majority of this non-interactive status such as the driver load list with occasional interactive prompts such as the OS Selection screen.  The other type is UI is the console presented by the headless tools like the SAC and !SACs that offer a command set and are always interactive.  A third category of UI interface will emerge which is status that is not displayed locally but is displayed remotely for logging.  By minimizing the amount of blackout between components and maintaining a uniform look and feel to all UI we can provide a cohesive experience for the admin.  Sample screen shot of the OSLoader Sample screen shot of Text Mode Setup Sample all screens of Attended Text Mode, Unattended GUI Mode Setup screens Sample screen shot of the Driver load list Sample screen shot of the SAC (Tlist) Sample screen shot of the Blue Screen SAC (showing the blue screen redirection as well) EFI dependencies: API and Interfaces The WMI provider for changing configuration provides additional interfaces; see section 2.1.4  Manageability New APIs and Interfaces HeadlessEnableTerminal HeadlessCheckTerminalForReboot HeadlessPutString HeadlessDisplayClear HeadlessDisplayClearToEOD HeadlessDisplayClearToEOL HeadlessDisplayAttributesOff HeadlessDisplayInverseVideo HeadlessDisplaySetColor HeadlessDisplayPositionCursor HeadlessTerminalPoll HeadlessTerminalGetByte HeadlessTerminalGetLine Changed APIs and Interfaces These are now exported: NtShutdownSystem RtlTimeToElapsedTimeFields ZwAssignProcessToJobObject ZwCreateJobObject ZwOpenJobObject ZwQueryInformationJobObject ZwSetInformationJobObject ZwTerminateJobObject Removed APIs and Interfaces Scripting Interfaces There are no interfaces to script except for those provided by the WMI provider to allow enabling and configuration of the EMS code.  Because the WMI provider model is used, all configuration changes will be scriptable via the Windows Scripting Host.  See  2.1.4 manageability for specific configuration options.   It is possible to automate response to information sent by the EMS.  This code would be in the form of a management application on the administration terminal, not on the headless server. Manageability For install information, see section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification   and section 2.2  Setup Requirements  . The most convenient mechanism for deployment is via a Windows Answer File. The headless settings in the boot.ini will be configured via WMI provider.  On EFI systems the only setting is to turn off EMS RedPort output despite the EFI/FW settings.  The server must be restarted for the settings to take effect.  There is an open issue for allowing changing the firmware serial console settings via ACPI or some other mechanism.  The possible boot.ini settings are: COM1  COM2  UseBIOSSettings COM1at19200 COM2at19200 Note:  With this implementation, StartROM.com would have to be changed manually on the BINL server to mach any new settings unless the system was running in  use BIOS settings  mode, i.e. the change was accomplished by changing the BIOS settings (in the firmware) only, or the machine was an EFI machine.  Performance Goals Performance Counters There are no items that it is deemed interesting to instrument performance counters. Security Impact Because of requirements of multiple simplistic and varying components, out band management must rely on the communication medium for security.  In the case of serial, that security is provided by the physical limitations of the serial connect.  Serial cables are short, don t support routing, they are single point to single point and in order to attach one you need to local to the machine and either remain local or use some other system which can employ logical security, such as terminal concentrator, convert the serial stream to a suitable medium.   EMS console relies on physical security.  No logon or password is required. Anyone who accesses the terminal can do significant damage to the system and possibly it s peers. Note:  OSChooser presents a login screen to the user, but in fact the individual keys typed in the password would be sent in plain text across the serial cable.   HYPERLINK "http://mste/interface/issue9/home.asp"  http://mste/interface/issue9/home.asp  for more information about how to make sure your feature is secure. Security Context The EMS runs as part the kernel.  It requires no log on.  A normal user should never have access to the EMS.  The WMI provider that configures the EMS runs in user mode and requires administrator privileges.   Setup Requirements There are substantial changes to setup required in terms of making it run headless.  Those are covered in section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification .  The information in this section is how the OS can be enabled and configured for headless use once setup has completed. There are 4 ways that headless can be enabled.   Attended Text Mode, Unattended GUI Mode   Attended Text Mode, Unattended GUI Mode allows a manual setup to be run on a headless server.  All the information necessary to complete setup is entered during text mode thus allowing the GUI mode part of setup that would typically require user interaction to run hands free.  See section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification  for information related to Attended Text Mode, Unattended GUI Mode setup.  Unattended setup   There is a section in the unattend file that provides the settings for configuring the server to run headless. These settings are also used by setup to run headless.  See section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification  for details of how setup is enabled to run headless.  The Setup.SIF headless settings are written to both the boot.ini entry for the final OS installation and all the temporary setup entries. Use BIOS settings COM1 19200 COM2 19200  Sample Setup.SIF headless section: Note for EFI Compliant Systems:  There is no boot.ini.  NTLDR will always use what the console serial device path (or eventually, other acceptable RedPort)  returns unless headless is configured to be Off in the EFI boot manager.  If the there is no serial (or other acceptable RedPort) device path returned from the console boot service, headless will not be supported on that system. .  If the user wishes to turn off headless support on the serial port, they may do so by configuring the firmware to not use the serial port (or eventually, other acceptable RedPort)  as a console, if this is supported by the EFI firmware, or by specifying off in the boot manager.  See the separate specification < RIS on Server Spec > and section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification  for related information on RIS requirements for headless. WMI provider   If an administrator wishes to enable headless support after the system has been setup, the admin may use the headless WMI provider to and enable headless support.  This requires no changes to setup.  See 2.1.4  Manageability  for more details. Hardware/Environmental Requirements  A serial port at the standard location of COM1 or COM2 is required.  There is a specification for the BIOS to indicate which COM port and the settings it used for redirecting the console, <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management>.  On a system with EFI compliant firmware, see the Extensible Firmware Initiative specification, the device path for the console will be used to determine the proper COM port and associated settings, if applicable.  If the system firmware does not support <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management> or the EFI serial console device path, the EMS can be configured for COM1 or COM2 using the boot.ini, see section 2.1  Detailed Feature Description and Specification .     COM Port COM1 (preferred) or COM2 9600 or 19200* Parity Data Bits Stop Bit(s) Service Processors or ASICs can be supported as long as they can be configured to release the serial port for use by the OS once StartROM.com or NTLDR are running. *Note: 19200 is provided for compatibility in with legacy out of band management solutions provided by OEMs, such as Compaq s IRC.  These systems are common among customers who have been running NT  headless with it s current limitations.  These customers rely on the increased reliability of being able to restart the server with a hardware solution and are one of the key targets of the our first rev (one example is Goldman Sachs).  This is only an issue on legacy systems with BIOS that don t support <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management>.    In this case all the EMS components that get their settings from the boot.ini may be configured to 19200 baud.  It isn t necessary for the other components to support redirection on these legacy systems because they support hardware redirection.   Network Bandwidth Boot time There may be slight delay during boot while a remote screen is painted.  This is unlikely to affect boot time in a noticeable manner.   Note:  The removal of legacy video cards may cause a delay as calls to VGA time out during boot.   This is beyond the purview of this spec.

Registry Key Changes Registry Key Deletions Other Considerations Dependencies Team Dependencies RIS on server   There is no RIS development team, although oddly enough there is a test team.  There is very little code change here. Removal of video card requirement   The video subsystem team will have to remove the blue screen code.  Some of the test for this might fall under the headless team.   Code Dependencies Scenario Dependencies If IHV s fail to provide systems that conform to <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management> or EFI, and aren t designed to compliment our headless implimentation it negatively affect the customer experience quite severely.  This is unlikely as long as we provide appropriate evangelism.  It would also be beneficial if those companies that provide management solutions integrated support for headless into there general management products.  This is of less importance and is also likely. Win64 Issues Because much of the EMS code runs during bootstrap and load of the systems the move from BIOS to EFI has major impact on EMS.   For specific information, see the  EFI dependencies:  sections of 2.1 and 2.1.1.   This is shouldn t present to much of an issue, but it is a incremental work item and a test hit to support both legacy BIOS and EFI. Localization/Globalization Issues The output on the serial port on a headless system is VT100 which does not support localization.  A separate spec, <VT100+>, is aimed at creating a better terminal type that still maintains backward compatibility with VT100 in the western character set case.  This will require the appropriate support for displaying alternative languages on the administrator s console and that the appropriate code page(s) be available on the administrators machine.  Note:  The current loader etc. use DBCS to for representing non-western characters, but EFI requires Unicode.  In the 5.1 time frame it will likely make sense for the loaders to switch entirely to Unicode.  Accessibility Issues Text sizes and brightness and contrast can be adjusted using the administrative terminal software.  This requires these features to be present in the administrative terminal.  This is beyond the scope of this document and the scope of what AdamBa s team is doing. Compatibility Hardware Compatibility We are compatible with standard serial ports as long as they use the standard serial ports addresses for COM1 or COM2. One of requirements is VT100 compatibility.  Current HW out of band solutions.  Because of the design of many OEM out of band solutions which do not release the serial port at boot time, there will be incompatibility with them.  This doesn t break an previous functionality we provided, as this is new technology.  We have made some design decisions based on compatibility with certain HW vendors.   Application/Component Compatibility Heterogeneous Network Compatibility N/A Any network issues would be due to the equipment attached to the RedPort.  This might include an NT server running Bridge and Watcher or a terminal concentrator.  This external hardware and software may have limitations in heterogeneous Networks, but the limitations would not be a result of the EMS. Backup Steve Olsson will provide some content. Does this feature use a private data store?  If so, how does it get backed up?  No private data store. Reliability Issues With the exception of the WMI provider, the EMS components run entirely in kernel mode and at a very high priority, when applicable.  This is because it is designed to be available when the rest of the system is not.  It must be kernel mode to function.  Bugs in the EMS will certainly be disastrous for system reliability.  That is why the code is being kept simple and we are avoiding large or sweeping changes to the current components. The EMS components can not be thought of in the on the same way typical Windows components are, it is closer in function to the debugger than it is to most Windows components. The EMS has many features that if misused will render a server useless.  It is aimed skilled administrators not novice or even power users.  The EMS actually allows the user to restart the server on command as a feature to improve availability.  This command is aimed at getting the system back up when all else fails. If configuration changes are made to the boot.ini settings, they require a restart to take effect.  This is similar to changing the debugger configuration. URL requirements Supportability Once again it s important to note that only skilled admins would or should be using this feature.  It is extremely non-obvious (it s accessed externally to the machine) and it requires an understanding of serial ports and terminal programs to get it working.  If users are having trouble with the EMS, it generally means the system is such bad shape that nothing will work. There are likely to be problems in the area of  identifying the proper serial port internally and externally and determining which one the bios is using.  Also many vendors use different  Esc code  to represent the keys that aren t available through standard terminals, like F1-F12.  The spec <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management> is designed specifically to help alleviate initial configuration of the port and simplify tasks like entering firmware setup.  The spec <VT100+> is aimed at eliminating differences in how you actually express the same keys and commands across different vendors.  Both of these will take time to be adopted. Logging/Eventing EMS keeps a  log of the OS during certain parts of boot.  This is detailed in section 3.1. Error Messages We use the same error messages as the standard windows components such as setup.  We will reflect any changes they make. Diagnostic Tools Recovery from Corruption or Error Conditions The EMS is the mechnanism for recovery for the OS.  Because of the circumstances in which the EMS runs, if it fails, there are no additional mechanisms for recovery except to reset the box. User Assistance Issues We will work with UA for the text messages and errors.  We will also work with UA on any GUI mode configuration tools. Key feature interactions Terminal Services  N/A This feature runs below that level.   Clustering N/A This feature runs below that level.   Network Infrastructure Remote Access N/A, it s only function is to run remote over a slow link. Multiple Hops Network Media Downlevel support Is downlevel client support required for this feature?  If so, how will it be delivered and when? External Developer Impact Sustained engineering Plan AdamBa s team Patents Currently no patents have been disclosed. Information Exposure It existence as a feature must be promulgated.  A white paper for designing HW will be created; this may include references to some of the documents listed in 1.6 (the related docs section of this spec.).   High Level Test Plan Test strategy The test team will develop a cohesive set of test cases and scenarios, which will expose as many bugs as possible in the Headless EMS component before it is shipped.  There are several sub-sections that will be addressed: Setup (Remote Install, Attended, Unattended setup). Headless WMI provider Recovery console (with Net Use command) Kernel message redirector  Headless Blue-screen scenarios APIs and Interfaces (new and changed) Secure Admin Console (SAC)  !SAC for OSLoader/ NTLDR !SAC for Blue screen redirection The test strategy for the SAC and !SAC is as follows. The states we are interested in are OS Loader, kernel initialization, normal operation, blue screen, and OS in distress states. Using tools, facilitate transitions into any of these states so that we can test the SAC and !SAC where applicable. Now verify the operation of SAC and !SAC. In addition, the SAC functionality has to be tested in GUI mode setup of the operating system also. The new API s and interfaces listed in sections 2.1.2.1 have to be tested. Simple parameter tests and typical usage tests will be done on these APIs.  The changed API s listed in 2.1.2.2 have to be delegated to the appropriate NT test developers. Functionality Under the umbrella of Functionality Testing, we must develop the following test cases: Test the interfaces and classes exposed by the headless WMI provider.  This will take the form of automated tests implemented using the Microsoft Scripting Host.   Various setup scenarios should be performed to ensure that various combinations of hardware and inputs are tested.  This is mentioned here as opposed to the Setup/Upgrade section below, since Setup is a large part of the headless functionality. Note that since the headless component will allow text-mode setup to be redirected to the headless terminal, it will be possible to perform the setup testing in an automated fashion.  To do this, test software to imitate a terminal will be developed. There will also be a requirement for various supported hardware platforms to be tested, to ensure that there are no problems running the headless functionality.  For more see the WHQL section below. It will be necessary to simulate blue-screen conditions on the machines under test, to ensure that the correct information is sent to the terminal, and the correct mini-dumps are created.   The recovery console will also be redirected to the headless terminal.  It will be necessary to test the recovery console to ensure that it operates properly when run through the headless terminal.  Note that in the remote install scenario, the recovery console will include a  net use  command, to allow the machine to connect to network resources.  This  net use  command should be fully tested. It will be necessary to ensure that the kernel messages are redirected properly during kernel initialization.  Since each machine and scenario will have different drivers being initialized at different times, this may require manual verification. The new headless API s will be tested with various valid and invalid parameters testing for boundary conditions, in the appropriate states. The commands supported by the !SAC are present during the following Phases: OSLoader/ NTLDR and Blue screen redirection. The SAC is supported after kernel initialization. The functionality tests will concentrate on verifying the proper working of SAC and !SAC in the various OS states. Constraining the resources needed by SAC and !SAC like red port hardware with console (?), Memory, CPU, Libraries, etc. are interesting cases. For example, the CPU utilization is 100%.  For the !SAC, the following functionalities should be tested: The system restarts with the Restart command.  Verify whether any settings done prior to restart are lost.  The system shuts down after the shutdown command.  Verify whether any settings done prior to shutdown are lost. Dump the log and verify its contents if possible. Check the status and events logged. Verify the system GUID. Make sure the help and ? work. The SAC testing will be focused on scenarios aimed at getting the system to normal state using the SAC commands after the system management mechanisms are down.  Verify that the information retrieved by the tlist command is accurate. Toggle the tlist info to processes and vice versa Change the settings of a process, like priority, and memory limits. Kill the erroneous process using the kill command. Try the same with invalid process id. Verify the system GUID returned. Check the shutdown and restart of the machine. Verify the settings. Try large number of shutdown and restarts. List all the available commands with the ? key. Regression These items have been included in the Functionality section above.  All the high priority functional tests have to be regressed with each build of NT, with all other tests being run on a regular basis. Stress Tests will be developed for stress testing the headless WMI provider and SAC/mini-SAC functionality. Setup/Upgrade Setup tests need to verify that the component behaves as expected in all setup and upgrade scenarios.  This includes the items mentioned above in 5.1.1.  Please note that we will probably be able (by imitating the headless console) to automate most of the setup scenarios.  This will make setup testing much easier and cost effective.  The different setup scenarios to be considered are unattended install (using remote install and using answer files) as well as text-mode attended setup.  The text-mode attended setup leads to an unattended GUI mode setup. Interop The test strategy needs to describe how the component/subsystem under test will interact with other parts of the system and/or other systems.  The interoperability test plan will include information on the tests that need to be run to determine that all components of the operating system will co-operate properly with the headless component.  The kernel mode driver for Headless does not appear to have any software interoperability issues.  There may be various hardware interoperability issues, which will have to be tested for. Reliability Long haul testing is not really suited to testing the headless component, since the headless terminal is only used in the event that a server crashes or is in distress.  It may be an idea to put the headless services on long-haul servers, as this will provide the typical user scenario in the event of the long-haul server crashing (or becoming distressed).  This is more applicable to the SAC/mini-SAC testing.    Robustness Driver verifier, IO Verifier, and fault injection must be used to expose robustness bugs in the headless component. Long haul Long haul testing can be done by adding the headless component to long-haul servers, and ensuring that the component works in the event of the long haul server crashing or becoming distressed.  The component cannot be made to make maximum use of available resources, but the services being tested on the long-haul servers can be.  This may expose issues in the headless component. Deployment The component can be deployed in real life scenarios right here on the Microsoft campus.  Servers being used can be equipped with headless hardware, and have the component installed.  This can be done, for example, in the remote install lab or in the build lab. Also, when interim releases of the operating system are sent out to Beta sites, testers can be encouraged to use the headless component.  This will expose more bugs, as usage scenarios change.  Y2K testing will involve performing all of the tests in the test suite on interesting dates.  Attempts must be made to test operation during interesting date changeovers. Globalization Globalization applies mainly to the Bridge/Watcher section of the headless component, and its test plan is not within the scope of this document. Geopolitical The headless component should be tested for geopolitical correctness. Automation Most of the tests for this component will be automated. The following tests will be automated by and application which will be simulating the headless terminal: Headless remote install, attended/unattended setup Headless blue-screen scenarios Recovery console (with net use command) Kernel message redirector. Secure Admin Console (SAC)  !SAC for OSLoader/ NTLDR !SAC for Kernel during initialization !SAC for Blue screen redirection The following tests will be automated using the Microsoft Scripting Host, and a script running on the server under test: Headless WMI provider. Automated API tests for new API s added for the headless component will be tested using automated regression tests. WHQL Deliverables There will be a test developed to allow WHQL and OEMs to test hardware for compatibility with the <ACPI Fixed Table Entry to Indicate the Port for Out of Band Management> specification. Ship criteria The quality bar for shipping this component is as follows: No active priority one bugs Meets all long haul, reliability and robustness criteria. Test Results Test results will be logged using Test Enterprise.  Schedule/Staffing Staffing The work will be done by Adam Barr, Sada Rajaram, and Sean Selitrennikoff. Priorities Here is our schedule with expected completion dates for each sub-item. Note that almost all the items are almost complete. Every item is priority 1 except as noted: Adam: f. Add GUI to system to add/remove Remote Administration Components.   Need info from the WMI team on how to expose this via WMI   1/31/00 a. Getting the current code checked in, and built as a single set of binaries   This will be done once the Odyssey Source Depot tree is up - 1/31/00 h. Define  s Bell Protocol  and add it to specs and evangelize it.   Need to get BryanWi involved in this, once defined, need some blue-screen/watcher work to support it  - 1/31/00 i. Add EFI support.   EFI spec handling of serial redirection needs to be clarified, then implemented, then we can start - unknown j. On machines with BIOS redirection, figure out how to get parameters used by BIOS and transfer those to redirected NT components.   Need to work this out with BIOS vendors   unknown (priority 2) b. Adding switches to the current code to enable/disable serial redirection at the various stages   Done c. Make which serial port we redirect configurable thru all the stages   Done q. Add serial redirection to StartROM.com, all loader variations, and blue screen.   Done s. Add serial redirection to recovery console.   Done w. Change the kernel to grab the required serial port exclusively very early in the boot process (suggested just after KdInit() is called).   Done u. Must be a way to enable serial redirection from a CD, right from the beginning.   hit F11 or F12 to enable it - 12/15/99 z.  Change RCC design to use new kernel APIs to take over the serial port.   APIs are exposed, need to use them - 12/15/99 y. Change the kernel to accept restart, shutdown, and dumplog commands until told not to.   If the RCC is not running, this allows some simple tasks - 12/15/99 x. Change the kernel to log boot information until told not to.   Need some clarification on what to log - 12/31/99 r. Add a rescue console for killing processes, lowering priority, etc.   Mostly working -- needs time change and raise/lower priority - 1/15/00 t. Add network access to recovery console   Was working, but now broken, need to investigate - 1/15/00 v. Allow restart from serial port if any loader errors out.   Similar to what you see with item y. - 1/15/00 e. Add GUI to setup to install Remote Administration Components (RCC and Serial Redirection)   For now, will just enable redirection from boot.ini, item f. (WMI control of boot.ini/RCC) will let you enable more - 1/31/00 g. Define escape sequence for keys not available on a vt100, e.g. F12.   These are in use now, need to spec them officially - 1/31/00 aa. Add a parameter to the unattend file to allow redirection to be turned on, with the expected values: no, com1, com2, and biossettings. SetupLDR would read this and immediately start redirecting if it detects it (we would try to have this test done as early as possible)   2/15/00 bb. Support a parameter to the recovery console lines in boot.ini instructing it to redirect (com1/com2/biossettings) -- note that changing winnt32 itself to actually write this parameter is not our responsibility   2/15/00 cc. Enable redirection in SetupLDR/setupdd if this is machine supports BIOS redirection, we can detect it is on, and there is no other info about redirection available (we did not boot through StartROM.com, F1/F2 was not hit, there is no answerfile key about redirection)   unknown, based on BIOS support (priority 2). dd. In the previous case, and the case where redirection was enabled via F1/F2 (that is, the two cases where we redirect but there is no answerfile), in addition to presenting Sada's new screens for machine name, organization, user, timezone etc, we also present a screen asking if the user wants to continue with redirection enabled (in boot.ini). Hitting Enter should keep it on, a different key should disable it.   2/15/00 (priority 2) l. Add netshell command to RCC.   Done o. Ensure that setup works on a system with 2 net cards, one on a private net w/DHCP and RIS, the other on Internet with a fixed IP address.   Have a solution that runs rcc with netsh at the end of setup, but otherwise configures the n/w cards with default settings - should be OK for now m. Create a  watcher  program which will poll and log multiple vt100 conversations over TCP/IP.  When  watcher  recognizes any of the items defined in (h) above, it wakes and notifies the user.   Need to internationalise it. Some more work needed on reading the sessions from a file and getting watcher to save sessions in an understandable manner. - 12/15/99 k. Determine how to deal with localized loaders, bootfont.bin, and vt100.   At first this may only work when running tcclnt directly under watcher - 12/31/99 n. Create a  bridge  program which bridges TCP/IP to a serial line, simply passing bytes across with no translation, nor interpretation.   Need to look into how this will work with localized data, may need telnet changes. Tcadmin needs to be written - 12/31/99 d. Make textmode setup, oschooser, recovery console, etc, work well in the number of lines available on a vt100, and with no color   Done, but need to talk to telnet guys about better inverse/bold support - 1/31/00 p. Ensure that setup works on a system with no RIS present, boots of CD, gets static IP address during textmode setup.  Working, need to make sure added screens are OK - 1/31/00 (priority 2) Schedule Schedule Summary Milestone Short Description Duration Spec Complete Full functionality described in spec document.  All areas of template completed Jan 31, 2000 Dev Milestone 1 All items except EFI support and Using BIOS redirection parameters.. Feb 15, 2000 Dev Milestone 2 Support for EFI machines TBD based on spec changes and other code Dev Milestone 3 Support for using BIOS redirection parameters TBD based on evangelizing standard way for BIOSes to announce this, and availability of hardware that supports it. Detailed Schedule Milestone 1 Description All items except EFI support and Using BIOS redirection parameters.. Metric TBD based on test plan being completed. Duration Scheduled to be done by 2/15/00 Contingency Plan We could ship only the completed items, which is the vast majority of the work.   Milestone 2  Description Support for EFI machines Metric TBD based on test plan. Duration Unknown; it depends on factors beyond our control   EFI spec changes, availability of machines that support changes, and conversion of the current loaders to be proper EFI-compliants binaries. Contingency Plan We can simply not support EFI. This will have no effect on non-EFI machines.   Milestone 3 Description Support for using BIOS redirection parameters Metric TBD based on test plan Duration Unknown, requires that we define a standard (currently being done by program management), evangelize it, and get hardware that supports it. Actual work should not be very complicated. Contingency Plan The contingency plan, if we do not get machines in time, is to not support this, thus any time that redirection is configured in  use BIOS settings mode , this will be the same as  no redirection  which is the way the code works now.

management on a headless systems accessed via a serial port.  In a multiple server environment, it is useful to  concentrate  serial access to these multiple servers into a single device with network access, generally referred to as a terminal concentrator.  Bridge allows an NT machine to function as a serial terminal concentrator, allowing serial traffic from multiple serial ports to be viewed on terminals.  Typically a terminal would be accessed via telnet.  Watcher allows a single NT machine to monitor a large number of headless machines at once.  It is a multiple telnet client monitors traffic on a terminal and performs predefined actions when certain strings are found. This is part of our support for headless operation. Its goal is to enable headless in the enterprise and to enable NT in the terminal server space. Neither Bridge nor Watcher run on the actual headless machines. They run on machines that exist to support the headless machines.  Theme Relevance This relates to our theme of increasing manageability. Customer Scenarios Scenarios are all related to allowing easier administration of headless machines. They include: a customer wants to manage multiple headless machines without requiring that the admin station be within a serial cable s distance of the machine a customer wants to allow multiple admins to simultaneously view the output of a headless machine a customer wants to monitor multiple machines from a single admin station without continuously scanning their displays. Justification Business Justification Bridge will allow a cheap NT machine to be used as a replacement for a third-party terminal concentrator, and ensure an end-to-end NT solution in many environments. Watcher starts us on the path from simply being able to view what a machine is doing remotely, to actually reducing the management costs of administering remote machines.   Competitive Justification Third party vendors such as Lucent and Cisco sell third-party terminal concentrators for thousands of dollars. Bridge is bare-bones, it won t have all the fancy features those do, but it will be much cheaper and provide the core functionality. Watcher essentiallyoffers a very simple form of aggregations and automation enabling better administration by supporting generating WMI events, logging etc. Customer Justification Bridge is aimed at customers who have a small number of systems to manage in a headless environment.  Watcher is aimed at customers who want to automate some of their headless management. Industry Impact This will put price pressure on competing terminal concentrators in the low end.  It may create a new market for embedded NT. Technical Justification Goals To provide a cheap terminal concentrator that runs on NT (bridge). To provide a very basic aggregation and automation tool (watcher). To integrate with WMI (watcher). Non Goals To create a large-scale terminal concentrator. To provide an end all, be all of management. To plug into or replace 3rd party Management tools.  Scope What does this spec cover Bridge and Watcher What this spec doesn t cover Telnet server or the standalone telnet client. Related Documents Headless EMS Specification Feature Description Detailed Feature Description and Specification Bridge has four pieces: TCSERV -  TCSERV is a service that runs and owns the COM ports for the purpose of exposing them to TCCLNT. Each COM port has a user friendly name for the device name (\\??\COM1 or \device\serial0, e.g). Multiple TCCLNT can access a single COM port.   TCSERV s It gets its configsettings are stored in the registry, under tcservTCSERV\parameters key. Currently, we support configuring speed, data bits, stop bits, parity and the user  friendly name. To change tcservTCSERV, you have to change the registry, then send the service a parameter change message.  TCCLNT - a serial terminal program that runs on a system running TCSERV.  TCCLNT would typically be run inside a telnet session. It requires a parameter for the com port name or the user friendly device name (as configured for the TCSERV in the registry), and supports an optional parameter for an IP address , allows TCCLNT to access a TCSERV on a different system. Multiple running instances of tcclntTCCLNT can be viewing the same COM port. A possible future addition to TCCLNT is the ability to request that a certain amount of buffered data from the port be output after tcclntTCCLNT connects. The reason TCCLNT and TCSERV are split is to allow multiple copies of TCCLNT to view the same COM port. TCSERV may also buffer some amount of data from the COM port and allow TCCLNT to specify (via a parameter) that it wants the last N bytes to be transmitted to it when it starts up. TCADMIN and the Bridge WMI provider- a command-line utility that lets you display the ports that TCSERV is monitoring, and change them.  It will take care of modifying the registry and sending the appropriate messages to TCSERV . Possibly in the future we could write a graphical version of this. However the expectation is that the bridge machine will likely be running headless itself, so a WMI provider and a console mode app like TCADMIN are the best way to allow configuration. One addition to TCADMIN would be a way to say "add all com ports on the system" with one command. Watcher is a GUI-mode app: It is a multi-session telnet client that can be configured to do various actions when it receives certain sequences of characters in the input stream of a given session. Watcher will have sub-windows beneath its main window, each with a telnet session in it. An option on the menu of the main window will let you select a sub-window to bring to the front by name. Watcher will allow each session it is monitoring to be configured, in terms of where to telnet to, and what command to issue when it connects (for example if the machine it was connecting to was running bridge, the command to issue might be "tcclient com2"). Optionally it could also store logon and password information. The configuration of this will be done with a GUI window that is part of Watcher. Initially the only characters that Watcher will look for will be the BEL protocol for blue screens. However this could be extendable and customizable as we wish. The default action will be to generate a popup and maximize the window for that session. This could also be extended, in fact we could allow plug-in DLLs to be called. Watcher may also be extended to connect directly to a TCSERV instance on this machine (bundling the TCCLNT functionality in Watcher) or to a com port directly. Both of these could be simulated by running bridge on the Watcher machine and then telnetting to itself. WATCHER will expect data to be in OEM codepages and will do the necessary conversion. It will also optionally be able to handle data in other formats (ANSI codepages, JIS, etc), configurable for each telnet session. This *should* allow a single instance of Watcher to watch different localized builds at the same time. UI Description What functions are exposed to the user.  What does each function do?  How is it exposed to the user?  Include screen shots and mock ups where appropriate.  It may be useful to use a format where you describe the user action and then describe what takes place based on that action. Functions of the watcher:  Manage   Allows the user to set/edit parameters for the application. This will involve the sessions that are present in the watcher. Multi-Document Features   These include the standard features like HELP, EXIT, WINDOW functions Arguments to tcclntTCCLNT. The first argument is the device / com port name that you want to interact with on the tcservTCSERV service the second optional argument is the machine where the tcservTCSERV  service is running. For security reasons this may be removed from the product.  Tcadmin: The initial prompt is: Browse service settinssettings Add a new com port Send a parameter change message to the service Get current status of service Then each command prints more information as needed. Here is a screen shot of watcher showing two windows, one with an English build, one with a Japanese build, and a third window minimized: This shot shows the manage dialog up, with the three windows minimized behind it: Watcher will respond to certain events that it sees encoded on the serial line. This data will be sent as XML forms, delimited by the sequence 0x07 0x07 "<?xml?>" 0x07 (10 bytes) at the beginning, and a single 0x07 at the end. The only event currently spec ed is blue-screens, which will send XML data as follows: <TYPE>WARNING</TYPE> <GUID>00000 </GUID> <MACHINENAME>ADAMBA2</MACHINENAME> <IPADDRESS>1.2.3.4</IPADDRESS> <STOPCODE>0000001E</STOPCODE> <PARAM1>xxx</PARAM1> (and so on up to PARAM4 -- these are the stop parameters) </BS> When watcher sees this, it will generate a WMI event   details TBD. What are the top 5 usability issues you re going to solve? Ease of editing functions for the parameters. Single application to watch over different language and different protocol for the managed machines. The application will call user attention to various events in the managed machines defined by the bell protocol. Make sure you don t forget the CUI   every GUI feature should also have a character user interface.  See also   scripting interfaces section. The standard shortcuts are the Alt keys for the menu functions. M  for Manage  F4 for exit  H for Help and so on. API and Interfaces Describe all APIs and Interfaces used in this feature.

Performance Goals Performance Counters List the performance counters your feature exposes and how they should be used.N/A Security Impact What impact does this feature have on security?  HYPERLINK "http://mste/interface/issue9/home.asp"  http://mste/interface/issue9/home.asp  for more information about how to make sure your feature is secure. Telnet sessions in the watcher are completely automated. The password and the user name are stored in the registry in clear text. Security Context What security context must be used to perform various tasks with this feature?  Do I need to be an admin?  If so, why?  What can a normal user do?  What security context does an application need to modify a parameter?  Be sure to think about all the programmatic ways a feature can be accessed and how security context affects them. It runs in the context of the user who started the app. Setup Requirements Does this feature have any special setup requirements?  What does setup need to do to install this feature?  What upgrades are supported? It will follow the same rules as a typical server app. Hardware/Environmental Requirements  Describe the various user scenarios and their affect on the items below.  Note if scenarios are data dependant and take into account the various types of connectivity a user may have (slow link, etc.). This app will likely never be CPU bound. Dependent on the number of watcher telnet sessions open.  This is not a RAM intensive app. Unknown, but the footprint will be small. Network Bandwidth Telnet runs well in low bandwidth situations and this application doesn t send a high volume of traffic.

Registry Key Changes Registry Key Deletions Other Considerations Dependencies Team Dependencies Telnet changes will require dev and test resources. Code Dependencies In a sense we depend on the telnet code from sfu since tcclntTCCLNT runs inside of a telnet session. We also use the NT console API for the tcclntTCCLNT output. We likely will need some changes from the telnet team in order to make bridge work well, and possibly in the NT console as well. We are trying to mimic a terminal concentrator which just passes data bits through unchanged. However what we actually do is have tcclntTCCLNT display them on the NT console, where they are then picked up by the telnet daemon and sent on the net. In that process, there is a possibility of some loss of data. In particular: vt100 supports inverse, bold and blink mode, but our console does not (explicitly, although it does support foreground/background color setting). Thus that information might get lost. On localized headless builds, the data will come over the serial port in either DBCS or UTF-8 (still TBD, currently it is DBCS). Need to ensure that we the console and telnet will do the right thing in those cases. Will the telnet daemon be configurable to output DBCS or UTF-8 as needed? Would also like to make it possible to run bridge on any language of NT and have it  just work  even if the data going through is a localized build. This would require that we could print, as an example, Japanese characters to the console and have the telnet daemon pick them up properly, even if tcservTCSERV/tcclntTCCLNT was running on an English machine. To date we have not gotten timely responses to our queries from the telnet dev team. Scenario Dependencies What other features need to succeed in order for your scenarios to succeed?  What do other teams/partners (could be ISV s, IHV s, etc.) need to do for your scenarios to succeed?Same comment about telnet in sfu. Win64 Issues Localization/Globalization Issues In order for the watcher to manage different localized builds (Each session in the watcher can be in a different language ), the appropriate code page support and font support must be available on the host machine. The bridge program can pass through unchanged. Accessibility Issues Compatibility Hardware Compatibility N/A, they are only apps. Application/Component Compatibility Heterogeneous Network Compatibility The components themselves (the machines bridge and watcher are running on, the headless machines) must be NT. The rest of the network is not affected however. Backup Steve Olsson will provide some content. Does this feature use a private data store?  If so, how does it get backed up? Reliability Issues Both bridge and watcher run in user mode URL requirements Supportability New features should typically be self supporting if at all possible - meaning that they are able to provide appropriate status, diagnostic and or self-repair information without requiring add-on tools from a resource kit.  Describe how your feature can 1) help users solve their own problems, and 2) how it can minimize the time during a PSS support call by providing quick access to relevant status and configuration information about both the feature itself and the environment for which it s configured. Logging/Eventing What does this feature log, when does it log it, and what is useful about it? Error Messages What are you going to do to improve the error messages in this feature? Diagnostic Tools If applicable, what other diagnostic tools are available for this feature?

Information Exposure What parts of this project do we expect to expose outside of Microsoft?  What should be exposed in the DDK, SDK, Consortium Specs and Papers. What will remain strictly proprietary? High Level Test Plan Test strategy The Test Strategy is to take each of the components of the bridge and watcher and to test them individually in the areas of their functionality, stress, correctness, and globalization. After component level testing we would proceed to integration testing and interoperability testing of the different components. Functionality For functionality testing of TCCLNT and TCSERV we would test if the streams output by the headless server is what the TCCLNT outputs to the watcher. This would include testing with special characters in the stream and with different encoding of the stream. We would also be testing for multiple instances of TCCLNT talking to TCSERV and the TCSERV listening to multiple headless servers. This would involve looking into synchronization issues specially if we consider that TCCLNT could also be writing to the same serial port of the headless server, through TCSERV. For API testing of TCCLNT we would test TCCLNT passing in different parameters at startup. For tcadmin, we would test the effect of each of the commands on TCSERV. Only the administrator should be able to use tcadmin. For functionality testing of the watcher we would verify the data displayed is the data output by TCCLNT. Also we would verify and test the various actions it takes on seeing certain sequences of characters in the input stream of a given session. We would also test multiple sessions being handled by the watcher and verify their correctness. These sessions could be running the under different configurations. All the multi-document features of the watcher graphical interface as well as the watcher character user interface should be tested. We would also test the capability of running the watcher to either run telnet sessions or direct TCCLNT sessions.  Regression Regression tests include functionality tests, setup variations, manual variations, and any other tests that are run on a regular basis.  Stress For the bridge, test the performance of TCSERV when many TCCLNT s are connected to it.  Multiple TCCLNT s may be connected to the same COM port. This would be of particular interest since the bridge can and probably will be a low-end machine. Large number of COM ports on a bridge is another interesting scenario. For the watcher, test the performance with watcher handling multiple telnet sessions and test correct behavior of the UI with multiple windows for each session trying to alert the user or trying to do the appropriate commands. For testing performance under stress for both the bridge and watcher, process counters and any application specific counters would be monitored.  Setup/Upgrade Setup tests need to verify that the component behaves as expected in all setup and upgrade scenarios. Interop The bridge and watcher has to be tested with other third party products in the market. The watcher should be tested with third-party terminal concentrator from Lucent or Nortel. The bridge can be tested with several third-party vt100s. Reliability Running the bridge and watcher for a long duration under different configurations and checking for system resources used, memory leaks, and data transmitted can test the reliability of the bridge and watcher.  Robustness Fault Injection tests could be used to verify the robustness of the bridge and watcher system.  Long haul Run the bridge/watcher on a set of headless servers for a long duration and measure counters on the machine checking for system resources used, memory leaks, data transmitted.  Deployment The Bridge and Watcher can be deployed in real life scenarios right here on the Microsoft campus. The Hotmail real-world scenario lab is particularly interesting for the deployment of these headless components.    Y2K testing will involve performing all of the tests in the test suite on interesting dates.  Attempts must be made to test operation during interesting date changeovers. Globalization Set up: Install the Bridge/ Watcher on an international build and verify that the interactive messages, help, dates, numbers etc during installation should be in the build language and appropriate format.  Functional testing on the different localized platforms. Run all the functional tests and see that all the interactive messages, help, dates, numbers etc should be in the build language and appropriate format.  Test the specific functionality of Watcher that allows it to watch different localized builds.  Geopolitical All components should test for geopolitical correctness. Automation All the user interface portions of the functional tests should be automated using Visual Test and batch files. The stress, long haul, and reliability tests will also be designed to run from the harness. The interoperability tests with the third party terminal concentrators will be manual testing. WHQL Deliverables If your testing includes hardware components then the test strategy should include documentation for the test program and meet WHQL requirements to ship on test CDs.  Ship criteria The quality bar for shipping this component is no active priority one bugs. It should also meet all long haul and reliability criteria. Test Results Test results will be logged using Test Enterprise.  Schedule/Staffing Staffing Descr This work will be done by Adam Barr, Sada Rajaram, and Sean Selitrennikoff. Priorities This is not relevant since the work is already code complete. Any bugs or new requests will be based on testing and actual usage.

This directory contains source files for COMMAND.COM, including
internal commands.

A list of the internal commands, some characteristics, and hints
about where they're found appears in TDATA.ASM, labelled COMTAB.

COMSEG.ASM contains a brief description of each segment in
COMMAND.COM.

  TRANDATA contains data which doesn't usually change, so is
  included in the transient checksum area, while TRANSPACE is
  modifiable, and excluded from the transient checksum.  TRANSPACE
  variable should be treated as uninitialized data for every
  command cycle.

Here's a listing of the general contents of files,
concentrating on central functions and publics in each module.

                        SETVER Command overview
			MS-DOS 5.00
			05/13/90

SETVER is an external MS-DOS command which allows the user to
determine the MS-DOS version number will be reported by MS-DOS
to a specified user application. This will allow applications
which check for a specific version of MS-DOS to run under
MS-DOS 5.0.

A version table has been included as part of the MS-DOS system
files on the user's boot disk. SETVER will update the system
files so that next time and times thereafter, that MS-DOS is
booted, the updated version table will be in effect. NOTE: The
changes to the version table will not take effect until the
user reboots using the updated version of the table.


NOTE:
	Currently there is 512 bytes set aside for entries in the
	table but Ericst may want to up it in the near future so
	for right now I wouldn't mention the number of entries
	which the table will hold. Right now it will hold a minimum
	of 34 entries.

==========================================================================

USEAGE:
		List table:	SETVER [D:]
		Add entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext N.NN
		Delete entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext /DELETE
		Display help	SETVER /?

WHERE:
		D: is the drive containing MSDOS.SYS
		name.ext is the executable file name
		N.NN is the major and minor version numbers
		/DELETE is any combination of /D - /DELETE

==========================================================================

MESSAGES:

	If the table is being updated and there are no errors detected
	this message will be displayed.

	"Version table successfully updated"

	If the version table is only being displayed it will listed
	on the screen in the format:

	WIN200.BIN     3.30
	EXCEL.EXE      4.01
	MYPROG.EXE     3.20
	DELNODE.EXE    4.01
	

==========================================================================

EXAMPLE 1:

	SETVER a: excel.exe 4.01

	This example will add a new entry in the table for EXCEL.EXE
	to the version table on drive A: and will tell DOS to always
	report the MS-DOS version number 4.01 to this application.

EXAMPLE 2:

	SETVER	a: excel.exe /DELETE

	This example will delete the EXCEL.EXE entry from the version
	table on drive A:.

EXAMPLE 3:

	SETVER

	This example will list the contents of the version table
	on the current drive.

EXAMPLE 4:

	SETVER /?

	This example will cause the SETVER command to display
	help in using the command.

==========================================================================

RETURN CODES:
	0  Successful completion
	1  Invalid command switch
	2  Invalid file name specified
	3  Insuffient memory
	4  Invalid version number format
	5  Specified entry was not found in table
	6  MS-DOS system files not found
	7  Invalid drive specifier
	8  Too many command line parameters
	9  Missing parameters
	10 Error reading MS-DOS system files
	11 Version table is corrupt in system files
	12 Specifed MS-DOS system files do not support a version table
	13 Insuffient space in version table for new entry
	14 Error writing MS-DOS system files


==========================================================================

ERROR MESSAGES:

ERROR:  Invalid switch

	The user specified an invalid command line switch.

ERROR:  Invalid file name

	The user specified an invalid file name for a new
        version table entry. Possible causes are the specified
        file name did not follow standard MS-DOS file naming
	conventions or was a reserved MS-DOS file name

ERROR:  Insuffient memory

	There is insuffient memory for the program to run.

ERROR:  Invalid version number format must be 2.11 - 9.99

	An invalid version number was specified. Possible causes
	of this are that the specified version number was not in
	the proper format or it was less than 2.11 or greater than
	9.99.

ERROR:  Specified entry was not found in the version table

	The tried to delete an entry which was not in the existing
	version table.

ERROR:  File MSDOS.SYS not found on specified drive

	The user specified a drive which does not contain MS-DOS
	system files.

ERROR:  Invalid drive specifier

	The user specified a drive that does not exist.

ERROR:  Too many command line parameters

	The user specifed too many command line parameters such as
	by specifing both a version number and the /DELETE switch.

ERROR:  Missing parameter

	The user entered a file name but forgot to include either
	a version number or the /DELETE switch.

ERROR:  Reading MS-DOS system file

	There was an error trying to read the system files on the
	specified drive. Possible cause is that the specified drive
	does not contain system files.

ERROR:  Version table is corrupt

	An error was detected in the version table and it is not
	useable. The user should replace the system files on that
	disk and try again.

ERROR:	System files on the specifed drive do not support a version table

	The user specified a drive which contains MS-DOS system files
	which at not version 5.0 or above.

ERROR:  Insuffient space in version table for new entry

	The version table on the specified drive is full. The user can
	delete some entries from the table and try again.
	NOTE:	To be sure of room for the new entry the user should be
		sure that the entry that is deleted has a file name
		at least as long as the new entry.

ERROR:  Writing MS-DOS system file
	
	There was an error while trying to write the updated version
	version table. This would be caused by a bad disk.

	H2INC - .H to .INC file translation program

This program produces .INC files from .H files.  It handles hex and decimal
constant definitions (both word and long), structures, bitfields, and
comments.  It has some trouble with certain kinds of #define statements, but
it currently handles everything interesting in the various internal and public
Winthorn files.

		    COMMAND FORM

    h2inc [-t] [-c] [-g] [-s symfile] file.h [-o outfile]

Example:

    h2inc -s os2def.h -s os2win.h user.h


Translates file.h to an .inc file, sending output to outfile.inc if specified,
or to stdout.  symfile.h is a file to be scanned for typedefs that are used
by file.h.  One or more of "-s symfile.h" may be specified.

The '-c' option retains comments. Default action is to strip comments.
The '-g' option is described later on in this document.
The '-t' option retains the use of the Hungarian tag prepended to structure
element names.  This is not always desired.


		    COMPILER DIRECTIVES

The #undef directive is ignored.  #include is handled by mapping to
the masm include statement.  The quote or angle bracket delimiters are
removed, and any extension is replaced by ".inc":

    #include "file.h"		->  include file.inc
    #include <file.ext>		->  include file.inc

Directives such as #ifdef, #if, #else and #endif are replaced by their
MASM equivalents.

Simple empty #defines are handled by assigning the constant the value of 1:

    #define INCL_GPIINCLUDED	->  INCL_GPIINCLUED equ 1



		    CONSTANTS

h2inc understands hex, octal and decimal constants, both 16 and 32 bits.
Constants in parens or preceded by casts are generally handled pretty well.
Here are some examples illustrating how various constants are translated:

    #define LONG_CONSTANT	0x12345678L
    #define LONG_CONSTANT2	333L
    #define WORD_CONSTANT	0x234
    #define DEC_CONSTANT	(-1)
    #define LONG_DEC_CONSTANT	(-4L)

produces:

    LONG_CONSTANT		equ 012345678H
    LONG_CONSTANT2		equ 333
    WORD_CONSTANT		equ 0234H
    DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-1)
    LONG_DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-4)

	'>>', '<<' and '!' are translated to SHR, SHL and NOT respectively.
	'&' and '|' are translated to AND and OR.

	When a type cast is uncovered,  it is blanked out.  Type casts are
	defined as ([ ]XXX[ ][*][ ]) where XXX is a type KNOWN to h2inc.
	Known types are the built in int, short etc and any other type
	that h2inc has discovered so far, for example in a typedef.


		   STRUCTURES

Fields in a struct are expected only one per line. Field declarations like
"INT a, b" are not handled.

h2inc does a pretty good job of determining whether to use db, dw, or dd. It
knows about all types defined in that .H file, plus the primary C types:
char, int, unsigned, etc. It can also handle things of form "STRUCTURE *"
and "STRUCTURE FAR *", and produce dw or dd as appropriate.

Any primary data type h2inc does not know about is assumed to be a structure.
If a primary data type is defined in another .h file, the "-s symfile" option
will cause h2inc to scan that .h file for any type definitions.  Those
definitions will be used when translating the source file.

Structure types, arrays, and bitfields are handled too.  Below is
an example structure, with its h2inc'd output:

 The example above will get translated as follows:

    typedef FOO DWORD

    typedef struct _STRUCTURE {	  /* str */
	SHORT wOne;
	SHORT wTwo;
	RECT *prc;
	RECT rc;
	FOO  rgrc[10];
	CHAR rgch[20];
	BOOL fOneBit:1;
	BOOL fTwoBits:2;
	BOOL fThreeBits:3;
	SHORT (FAR *lpfn)();
    } STRUCTURE;


    STRUCTURE	struc
	str_wOne	dw  ?
	str_wTwo	dw  ?
	str_prc		dw  ?
	str_rc		(size RECT)/2 dup (?)
	str_rgrc	(size FOO)/2 * 10 dup (?)
	str_rgch	db  20 dup (?)
	str_fs		dw  ?
	str_lpfn	dd  ?
    STRUCTURE	ends
    str_fOneBit		equ	00001h
    str_fTwoBits	equ	00006h
    str_fThreeBits	equ	00038h

As can be seen, bitfields are handled in an interesting way.  The C field
name, prepended with the abbreviation tag, is actually the mask constant
to use, rather than the field offset.  The field offset is ALWAYS "fs"
prepended with the abbreviation tag.

Besides the standard winthorn types, h2inc also keeps track of other types
defined in the file so that it can determine whether to use db, dw, dd, or
dup.

			    IMPROVEMENTS


	o ASM statements and directives can be included in a '.h'
	  file by enclosing as follows
	  /* ASM
		asm statements and directives
	   */
	   These statements and/or directives are not processed, simply
	   copied.
	   There is a variation of ASM directive - ASMX. This works only
	   with '-g'. It is intended to be useful for defining segment
	   related stuff.
	o A structure can be translated to ASM named segment by
	  naming the segment in a standard C comment on the same line
	  as 'struct'. Selectively the fields of the struct (nee segment)
	  can be declared PUBLIC or initialised. The initialisation has
	  two flavours INIT and AINIT. AINIT is for initialising arrays
	  with distinct values. The following eg. illustrates. This is only
	  possible using '-g' option.

		struct foo {			/* SEGMENT FOOSEG */
			short	able;		/* Nothing special */
			short	baker;		/* PUBLIC */
			short	charlie;	/* INIT <MAXFOOBLE> */
			long	delta;		/* PUBLIC INIT <42> */
			char	eagle[16];	/* Vanilla */
			short	fox[MAXFOX];	/* PUBLIC INIT <0> */
			long	golf[MAXG];	/* AINIT <2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13> */
		};

		Would translate to:

		FOOSEG	segment
		able	DW	?
			PUBLIC	baker
		baker	DW	?
		charlie	DW	MAXFOOBLE
			PUBLIC	delta
		delta	DD	42
		eagle	DB	16 DUP(?)
			PUBLIC	fox
		fox	DW	MAXFOX DUP(0)
		golf	DD	2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
			.errnz	($ - golf) - MAXG*(SIZE DWORD)
		FOOSEG	ends

	  with '-c' options on.

	o INT size can be specified as either 16 bits or 32 bits by
	  a directive
		/* INT16 */	or	/* INT32 */
	  if neither is specified, a warning is issued whenever
	  'int' is used.

	o Nested structure declarations are now handled.

	o Bit fields upto 32 bits are supported.

	o Embedded structures i.e. structures within structures should
	  be declared with a typedef. eg.

	  typedef struct foo foo;
	  foo	foobar[MAXFOO];
		of course, the struct foo itself is declared elsewhere.

Module Name:

    suballoc.c

Abstract:

    This module contains code for managing a paritially commited address
    space.  It handles allocation of chunks of memory smaller than the 
    commit granularity.  It commits and decommits memory as needed using
    the supplied function for committing and decommitting memory.  The 
    structures used for tracking the address space are allocated outside
    of the specified addresss space.

Author:

    Dave Hastings (daveh) creation-date 21-Jan-1994
    
Notes:

    Since this package does not actually access memory in the address space
    it is managing, it will work as well with real linear addresses or 
    "Intel Addresses" such as would be encountered with the Insignia Emulator
    on risc.

How to write flat 32->16 thunks

1. INTRO
--------------------------------------------------------------------
   

   - What are flat 32->16 thunks?

     THUNK.EXE is really three compilers that share a common parser.
     This file describes the "flat thunk" mode, which generates 32->16
     thunks that are mostly 32-bit (the other two modes are 16->32 thunks
     and 32->16 thunks that are mostly 16-bit).  


   - Why should I use flat thunks?

     Flat thunks do most of their work in 32-bit mode. This means better
     performance since they use a minimum number of selector loads
     and replace far16 calls with near32 calls. Also, the
     flat compiler is an aggressive optimizer: early results show
     a 30-40% code size reduction over the 16-bit code generator.


   - Then why use 16-bit 32->16 thunks at all?

     Approximately 200 thunks in Chicago have hand-coded portions which
     need to be ported by hand to 32-bit mode. For compatibility,
     16-bit thunks will be with us for some time to come.


   - Can I have both 16-bit and 32-bit thunks in my component?

     Yes, but you will need two thunk scripts: one for the 16-bit thunks
     and one for the 32-bit thunks. There is no way to mix types in a single
     script.


   - How does the thunk compiler work?

     The thunk compiler's input is a "thunk script", which is a list
     of C-style function prototypes and typedefs. It outputs a .asm file which
     is really two .asm files in one. Assemble it with the "-DIS_16"
     flag and you get a 16-bit .obj which you link into your 16-bit
     component. Assemble it with the "-DIS_32" flag and you get a 32-bit
     .obj which you link into your 32-bit component.

     The 16-bit component contains a jump table containing the 16:16
     address of each function named in your thunk scripts (these functions
     must exist elsewhere as PASCAL functions in your 16-bit component).
     The 32-bit half contains a STDCALL function for each thunk which
     converts its parameters to 16-bit and then calls (through some
     kernel32 magic) the 16-bit target named in the jump table. When
     a 32-bit app invokes a thunked api, it calles these compiler-generated
     STDCALL functions directly.

     For example, the thunk declaration for the LineTo api looks like this:

        typedef          int INT;
        typedef unsigned int UINT;
        typedef UINT         HANDLE;
        typedef HANDLE       HDC;
        
        BOOL LineTo(HDC, INT, INT) =
        BOOL LineTo(HDC, INT, INT) 
        {
        }

     The first function "prototype" declares the form of the 16-bit target
     and second declares the form the of the 32-bit target. As in most
     thunks, the two prototypes are identical. Like the C compiler, the
     thunk compiler interprets "int" as "short" in the 16-bit prototype
     and "long" in the 32-bit prototype.

     When this is fed through the thunk compiler, this is what pops out.
     On the 16-bit half, there is a jump table:

         externDef LineTo:far16

         FT_GdiFThkTargetTable:
                ...
                dw      offset LineTo 
                dw      seg    LineTo

     and LineTo is (say) entry #79. The 32-bit half contains the code:


        ; LineTo(16) = LineTo(32) {}
        ;
        ; dword ptr [ebp+8]:  param1
        ; dword ptr [ebp+12]:  param2
        ; dword ptr [ebp+16]:  param3
        ;
        public LineTo@12
        LineTo@12:
                FAPILOG16       1377            ;DEBUG only -- log api call
                push    ebp
                mov     ebp,esp
                sub     esp,40                  ;Work-space for kernel32
                push    word ptr [ebp+8]        ;param1: dword->word
                push    word ptr [ebp+12]       ;param2: dword->word
                push    word ptr [ebp+16]       ;param3: dword->word
                mov     cl,79                   ;Thunk index
                call    QT_Call16_ShortToLong
                leave
                ret     12

     When a Win32 app calls "LineTo", it transfers directly to this
     routine, which builds a 16-bit call frame and calls a local routine 
     asking it to please invoke api #79 in the 16-bit jump table and 
     sign-extend the return value (each component gets its own set
     of QT_ routines which knows what jump table to use.)






2. PROCEDURE FOR ADDING FLAT THUNKS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Write a thunk script containing thunk declarations and typedef's
        as above. core\thunk\gdifthk.thk and core\thunk\usrfthk.thk are
        good examples to start from. Put the lines:

                enablemapdirect3216 = true;
                flatthunks = true;

        at the start of your script. This tells the compiler you intend
        to write 32->16 thunks and to generate 32-bit code.

        The naming convention for flat thunk scripts is FooFThk.thk where
        "Foo" identifies your component. If you keep your script in
        the core\thunk directory, please follow this convention.



     2. Compile your thunk script:

            $(TNT) $(THUNK) -ynTb -t FooFThk FooFThk.thk FooFThk.asm

            $(TNT) = dev\tools\c\bin\tnt.exe
            $(THUNKCOM) = dev\tools\binr\thunk.exe

        The "-t FooFThk" provides a string which the thunk compiler uses
        to individualize identifier names. By convention, use the
        stem of your thunk script filename.

        For debug builds, eliminate the "-b" flag.

        The makefile in core\thunk has all this set up so it's easiest
        to check your thunk script there.




     3. Create a empty header file "FooFThk.inc". The 32-bit half of the *.asm
        file includes this header. This is where you put special-case 
        code for your thunks.




     4. Link the 16-bit half of FooFThk.asm into your 16-bit component. 
        Pass these flags to the assembler:
        
           -DIS_16

        Add the export:

            FT_FOOFTHKTHKCONNECTIONDATA
 
        to your *.def file and mark it internal. The 32-bit half 
        dynalinks to this symbol to access the 16-bit jump table.





     5. Link the 32-bit half of FooFThk.asm into your 32-bit component. 
        Pass these flags to the assembler:
        
           -DIS_32

        Core\thunk\fltthk.inc and FooFThk.inc must be in the
        include path.

        Do not pass the -DFT_DEFINEFTCOMMONROUTINES flag to activate
        the "ifdef"'d part of the .asm file. The "ifdef'd" part
        contains common support code that's to be linked into kernel32
        only. Including it in another module wastes code.




     6. In your DLL initialization procedure, execute the following
        for each PROCESS_ATTACH call:

                FT_FooFThkConnectToFlatThkPeer  PROTO near 
                                                pszDll16:dword, 
                                                pszDll32:dword

                pszDll16        db  'foo16.dll',0  ;name of your 16-bit dll
                pszDll32        db  'foo32.dll',0  ;name of your 32-bit dll

                ...



                invoke  FT_FooFThkConnectToFlatThkPeer, 
                        offset pszDll16, 
                        offset pszDll32
                or      eax,eax
                jz      failed
                ; success

        This initializes the flat thunks. The call executes a loadlibrary
        and getprocess address on the 16-bit module. The init routine
        itself is generated by the thunk compiler in the 32-bit half
        of the .asm file.



     7. Link your 32-bit module with dev\lib\kernel32.lib if you're
        not doing so already. The thunk code needs the import records
        for the support routines in kernel32.



     8. Build the components and test. Under debug, you
        can get a debug-port message for each flat thunk by
        setting the "fapilog16" variable in win32c.dll to 1.
        The "[F]" before the api name tells you that it's a flat thunk.




3. WHAT'S IN AND OUT FOR FLAT THUNKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The flat code generator supports:

        - Structures passed by value or reference.
        - Structures within structures.
        - Pointers within structures, provided that the object
          pointed to doesn't require repacking. The object can be
          another structure.
        - Arrays of scalars embedded in structures.
        - The "input", "output" and "inout" qualifiers for pointer 
          arguments. Default is "input".
        - "passifhinull" for pointer arguments.
        - The "hinstance" primitive type (for mapping instance handles)
        - "passifnull" for hinstances
        - "structsize" for integer structure fields

        - Returning pointers provided that the object pointed to requires
          no repacking. The object can be a structure.
        - The "voidtotrue" and "voidtofalse" qualifiers.


     Not supported:
        - Arrays of pointers or arrays of structures.
        - The "deleted" qualifier.
        - The "byname" qualifier
        - The "maptoretval" semantic.
        - The "sizeof" and "countof" semantics.
        - The "localheap" semantic.
        - The "reverserc" semantic.
        - The "callback" semantic.
        - "body = special", "raw pack/unpack", "push", "special".
          No hand-coding for flat thunks is allowed. Use wrappers
          instead to thunk complex routines.




4. SPECIAL-CASING A THUNK BODY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
**** HAND-CODING FOR THUNK BODIES IS BEING PHASED OUT. USE
     WRAPPERS TO THUNK COMPLEX API. SEE ATSUSHIK IF YOU NEED HELP
     ON THIS.
****




13. APPENDIX I: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NEW for the flat code generator:
    Revision 1: STRUCTSIZE and HINSTANCES


  Structure size fields:
     You can now thunk those fields that contain the size of its 
     containing structure. Just put the "structsize" keyword after
     the field name, like this:

            typedef struct tagFOO {
                DWORD cbSize   structsize;
                LPSTR this;
                LPSTR that;
            } FOO;

     The compiler will insert the 16-bit structure size when packing in,
     and the 32-bit structure size when packing out. You can mark
     any integral type field as "structsize", including UINT.


  HInstance:
     There's a new primitive data type "hinstance" (lowercase). I'll
     add a typedef for HINSTANCE (uppercase) as soon as I've cleaned out
     the old usage of HINSTANCE.

     "hinstance" maps to a 32-bit value for the 32-bit side and a 16-bit
     value for the 16-bit side. Hinstances can appear anywhere an integer
     can (except as the return value type). 

     NULL gets mapped to the current hinstance by default. You can make
     NULL map to NULL instead by adding the "passifnull" qualifier.
     If the hinstance is a structure field, add the "passifnull" qualifier
     as you would "structsize". If it's a parameter, put

     paramname = passifnull;

     inside the curly braces.

     Everyone is reminded that the 16-bit "hinstance" for a 32-bit app is
     really the hmodule. This works because most api that ask for hinstances
     really want hmodules.

ILINK 3306 README


INSTALLATION AND USE

Here in snap/bin, there are 3 linkers
	link.exe  (link.err)	the incremental linker, debug build
	rlink.exe (link.err)	the incremental linker, release build
	olink.exe (olink.err)	the non-incremental linker, release build

To use ilink, just sync.  Incremental linking is the default.

Ilink will create exe/dlls whose associated debug
info is stored in a program database (.pdb), in the so-called "NB10"
exe format.  (In contrast, the old link produced the "NB09" format.)
The shn0[d].dll here in snap/bin can debug any combination of
exes/dlls in either NB09 or NB10 format.

Ilink will automatically try to incremental-link, provided

* you aren't creating a map file
* you aren't specifying -debugtype:both or -debugtype:coff
* you aren't specifying -pdb:none
* you aren't specifying -incremental:no

To produce a Cuda compatible "NB09" .exe, link -pdb:none.


CVPACK R.I.P.!

Since ilink transports debug information without cvpack, we expect some
minor problems with the CodeView expression evaluator.  Please be on the
look out for any changes in EE behaviour, small or large and report them!


MIXING CUDA PDBS AND ILINK PDBS

Note that ilink can link objs created by the Dolphin and Cuda compilers,
e.g. both /Z7 and /Zi.  However, for now, please do not specify the
same .pdb for the compiler and the linker.

That is, do not specify
	cl -Zi -FdXYZ.pdb
when you are linking
	link -pdb:XYZ:pdb (or)
	link -out:XYZ.exe (which defaults to -pdb:XYZ.pdb).

Rather, change your "cl" line to use (for instance)
	cl -Zi -Fdmsvc.pdb (or)
	cl -Zi             (which defaults to -Fdmsvc.pdb)

Otherwise you will get this diagnostic when you link:
LNK1206: cannot (yet) overwrite Visual C++ 1.0 program database "%s"


PROBLEMS/COMMENTS

Please direct any comments/questions to JanGr or phinperf
as appropriate, and be sure to RAID and/or report any problems
you may have!

ILINK 3306 README


INSTALLATION AND USE

Here in snap/bin, there are 3 linkers
	link.exe  (link.err)	the incremental linker, debug build
	rlink.exe (link.err)	the incremental linker, release build
	olink.exe (olink.err)	the non-incremental linker, release build

To use ilink, just sync.  Incremental linking is the default.

Ilink will create exe/dlls whose associated debug
info is stored in a program database (.pdb), in the so-called "NB10"
exe format.  (In contrast, the old link produced the "NB09" format.)
The shn0[d].dll here in snap/bin can debug any combination of
exes/dlls in either NB09 or NB10 format.

Ilink will automatically try to incremental-link, provided

* you aren't creating a map file
* you aren't specifying -debugtype:both or -debugtype:coff
* you aren't specifying -pdb:none
* you aren't specifying -incremental:no

To produce a Cuda compatible "NB09" .exe, link -pdb:none.


CVPACK R.I.P.!

Since ilink transports debug information without cvpack, we expect some
minor problems with the CodeView expression evaluator.  Please be on the
look out for any changes in EE behaviour, small or large and report them!


MIXING CUDA PDBS AND ILINK PDBS

Note that ilink can link objs created by the Dolphin and Cuda compilers,
e.g. both /Z7 and /Zi.  However, for now, please do not specify the
same .pdb for the compiler and the linker.

That is, do not specify
	cl -Zi -FdXYZ.pdb
when you are linking
	link -pdb:XYZ:pdb (or)
	link -out:XYZ.exe (which defaults to -pdb:XYZ.pdb).

Rather, change your "cl" line to use (for instance)
	cl -Zi -Fdmsvc.pdb (or)
	cl -Zi             (which defaults to -Fdmsvc.pdb)

Otherwise you will get this diagnostic when you link:
LNK1206: cannot (yet) overwrite Visual C++ 1.0 program database "%s"


PROBLEMS/COMMENTS

Please direct any comments/questions to JanGr or phinperf
as appropriate, and be sure to RAID and/or report any problems
you may have!

The original error message is "Line too long".  If you don't see a line
that is too long, then you probably hit a Masm bug.

There is a long-standing bug in Masm 6.11 which generates error A2039
for no reason.  It's a bug in the parser that they cannot repro easily
(but of course, we can repro it just fine).  The workaround is to
insert comments and/or blank lines before the line where the parser
eventually chokes.

This is the reason for all the comments you see in source code that read

    ; Add unnecessary comment for MASM bug.

    ; This comment line works around a masm bug.

    ; This is a bogus comment because MASM is stupid and currently will
    ; not assemble this file without it.

    ; comment for masm 6.11 cause its a butthead

    ; comment to make masm happy

You can use one of the above, or make up one of your own.  Be creative!

Installable Virtual Device Driver (VDD) Support For NTVDM
==========================================================

Problem:
--------
There is a class of DOS applications which run on their
own custom hardware. Generally these applications will
have a pluggable card and a 16bit device driver for their
card. As these cards are beyond the scope of normal PC
architecture, NTVDM cannot virtualize them in a secure
manner. So all such applications are not supported under
NTVDM.

Solution:
---------

If an ISV is writing an NT native device driver for such a
card, it is technically quite simple to provide the support
such that the DOS application runs unmodified and in a secure
fashion. The vendor has to write a Virtual Device Driver (VDD)
which will virtualize the card for the DOS application by calling
the native device driver.

Following are the main work items to achieve the above solution:

    a. Loading the VDD
    b. Support for I/O mapped I/O
    c. Support for Memory mapped I/O
    d. Support for DMA operations
    e. Register manipulation services
    f. Memory accessing services
    g. Interrupt simulation services
    h. Miscelleneous services


a. Loading the VDD:

    The system administrator will add the command lines in the
    \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\CONTROL\"VirtualDeviceDrivers"
    section of the registry for all the VDDs to be loaded in the
    VDM process. The command line format is REG_MULT_SZ (i.e. ASCIIZZ).
    This key will laways be present and install program just need to
    add their VDD name.

    [VirtualDeviceDrivers]
      VDD = <full-path of the VDD1.DLL>\0<full-path of the VDD2>\0\0

    VDD ACTION :

    NTVDM will load all these VDDs from the registry at the VDM process
    initialization time and call their initialization routine. VDDs should
    make sure at this time that their respective NT device driver is
    present and make all the resource allocations. The VDD handle passed
    in this initialization routine will be the Id of the VDD when calling
    the VDD services as described below.


b. Support for I/O mapped I/O:

   Following services will be provided for VDDs to deal with  IO
   ports:

   BOOL VDDInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE, IO_PORT_HANDLERS);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE);

   The HANDLE is the one passed to the VDD in its DLLInit routine.
   Only one IO hook may be installed for a given port, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On DeInstalling, the default IO hook will be
   placed, which means no one is hooked on those IO ports. IO_PORT_HANDLERS
   should atleast provide a byte read and a byte write handler. In addition,
   word and string handlers can also be provided. In the absense of word
   or string handlers, these will be emulated using byte handlers.
   A port has to be hooked for both read and write. VDDs should not hook
   DMA ports as these are virtualized by NTVDM and services are provided
   for VDDs to access DMA.

   VDD Action:  On an IO access (or on a series of IO accesses) the VDD
                can check if it needs to start the DMA. If so it can call
                the DMA services given in the following section. If it
                does'nt require the DMA or if the DMA has transfered the
                buffer, then the VDD can call its NT device driver to
                complete the desired request. (Its also possible that the
                VDD first requests the device driver and than using DMA
                services copies the contents to the VDM buffer).


c. Support for Memory mapped I/O:

   Following services will be  provided for VDDs to deal with their
   memory mapped addresses:

   BOOL VDDInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE, MEMORY_HANDLER);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE);

   The addr_range should be a valid range i.e. above RMSIZE and below system
   rom. Only one Memory hook may be installed for a given range, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On deinstalling the range, VDD will no longer get page
   fault on those ranges.     Memory_handler will
   tell on which address the fault occured and whether it was a
   read or write fault. On its return from the memory handler it will be
   assumed that the fault was handled.


   A port-range will actually result in a whole page to be reserved. That
   means the page will not remain available to EMM for EMM page frames and
   UMBs.

   VDD Action: It can map the normal memory and let the app write to it.
	       Later they can use the WIN32 API's or its device driver
	       as per the case to deal the whole memory range.

d. Support for DMA operations

   Following DMA service will be provided for the VDD:

   DWORD VDDRequestDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, BUFFER, TRANSFER_BYTES);
   BOOL VDDQueryDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);
   BOOL VDDSetDma (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, INDEX, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);

   NTVDM will control all the DMA ports and will maintain all the
   information on per channel basis. There are two flavors in which
   a VDD can carry-out the DMA operations. It can call VDDRequestDMA
   and this service will interpret the DMA registers and do the
   DMA transfer. It should be clear at this point that this will
   involve two buffer copyings. For example, the VDD will ask the device
   driver to trasnfer some data in a buffer (allocated by VDD) then it will
   call this service to transfer this buffer to the address DOS application
   has asked for (through DMA programming).

   On the other hand, a VDD can collect all the DMA registers using
   VDDQueryDMA and figure out where the DOS application	has asked the
   DMA to take place, in what mode and how much to transfer. Then it can
   call the NT device driver with same address as asked by DOS app. In this
   case there will be only one copying. VDD should use VDDSetDMA after
   such an operation to update the DMA state.

e. Register manipulation services:

   See the reference section for details. There is a get and a set service
   for each V86 registers.


f: Memory Accessing services:

   Following services are provided for Manipulating VDM's memory.

   PVOID GetVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FreeVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FlushVDMPointer(ULONG Addr,
			ULONG Size, PVOID Buffer, BOOL ProtectedMode);

g: Interrupt simulation services

   Following services is provided for simulating an interrupt to the VDM.

   VOID VDDSimulateInterrupt (BYTE ms, BYTE line, WORD count);


h. Miscellaneous Services

   Following services will be provided for memory allocation/deallocation.

   VDDAllocMem (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);
   VDDFreeMem  (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);

   VDD will use VDDAllocMem when it gets a page fault on a page which
   it has hooked using VDDInstallMemoryHook. Later it can free this memory
   using VDDFreeMem. We are asking VDDs to use WIN32 API for all their needs
   and here also a VDD could have used VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree. The
   problem is that on a non-x86 machine this would'nt have worked because
   on such a plateform the VDM memory is under the emulator's control and it
   has to be told of such memory changes.

   Following service will be provided for VDM termination.

   VDDTerminateVDM (VOID);

   VDD will use this service to terminate the VDM. For instance if a VDD
   fails to allocate memory on a memory mapped IO, it may want to terminate
   the VDM as its state is inconsistenet.

   VDDs should always use these services to achieve plateform independence.

An Explanation of VDMDBG.DLL

                            BobDay - 10 Jun 93

Section 1.0 - Overview
Section 2.0 - The Simulated Environment
Section 3.0 - The 32-bit Environment
Section 4.0 - Communication Protocol via Exception
Section 5.0 - The VDM Debugging APIs

1.0 Overview

    This document describes the mechanism used to support debugging DOS and
    WIN16 applications under Windows NT.  The mechanism involves 2 parts
    in the simulated environment, one for v86 mode (or simulated real mode)
    and one for protected mode.  It also involves 3 parts in the 32-bit NT
    environment, one for fielding information from the simulated enviroment
    and sending it to the debugger, one for code in the debugger, and one
    for code in a DLL used by the debugger.

        16-bit simulated environment     32-bit environment

                NTIO.SYS                  DBG.LIB (in NTVDM.EXE)
                KRNL286.EXE               NTSD (WinDbg or equivalent)
                                          VDMDBG.DLL


2.0 Simulated enviroment

    Once the simulated environment is up and running, if one of the normal
    debugging type events occurs it gets simulated to happen exactly the
    way it would on a normal PC.  This means that if an INT 3 occurs, it
    pushes the flags, CS, IP, looks up the address in the IVT and then
    jumps to it.  Same goes for INT 1's and INT D's (GP Faults).  If the
    processor is in protected mode, these interrupts are normally trapped
    by the DOS extender (most of the time DOSX.EXE) and then reflected
    down into the real mode interrupts (except for GP Faults).

    In order to debug in the simulated enviroment, it is necessary to
    catch and process these events.  The simplest way to do this is to
    install our own routines to watch these interrupts and that is
    what NTIO.SYS and KRNL286.EXE do.  They are nothing but small
    stubs which insert themselves into the interrupt chains (NTIO.SYS
    inserts itself into the real mode interrupt chain, and KRNL286.EXE
    inserts itself into the protected mode interrupt chain).  It is important
    to install oneself as early as possible so that other programs (such
    as DEBUG.COM) can install themselves ahead of these small stubs.
    In this way the events are only detected when they are not handled by some
    program in the simulated environment.

    Also, segment loading and unloading notifications are routed to
    these small stubs so that the debugger can be notified when selectors
    are associated with programs and their symbols.

    The small stubs will perform a BOP (a method of transitioning from
    the simulated environment back to the real 32-bit NT environment and
    notifying it that a debug event has occurred). After the BOP, they will
    either perform an IRET instruction to return control back to the simulated
    program generating the interrupt, or pass the interrupt down to the
    previous interrupt handler (continue down the chain).  The decision
    whether to return from or pass the interrupt will be made on the basis
    of the ContinueDebugEvent continue status parameter.  DBG_CONTINUE will
    IRET, DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLE will pass it back down the chain.

3.0 32-bit environment

    Once the 32-bit environment has been notified that a debug event has
    occurred, it begins executing code in NTVDM (DBG.C) which parcels up the
    register context (based on the type of event which occurred) and
    communicates all the information to the debugger.

    Since the debugger is in another process's context, communication
    is done through exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception with the
    status STATUS_VDM_EVENT.  Exception information will be passed via the
    "lpArguments" parameter to the API RaiseException().

    The lpArguments parameter will cause an array of 4 DWORD values to
    be passed to the debugger. The values of the meanings of the array
    will be discussed in section 4.0

    The debugger should receive this exception and return from the call
    WaitForDebugEvent (debuggers should always have some thread waiting
    for debug events).  By examining the events dwDebugEventCode member,
    the debugger can determine the type of the debug event.  If this type
    is EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT, then the

          u.Exception.ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode

    member of the debug event structure will contain the exception type.
    If this value is STATUS_VDM_EVENT then the exception is coming from the
    16-bit environment.

    When an exception of this type is detected, a debugger should load (if
    it hasn't done so already) the VDMDBG.DLL and determine the addresses
    of the key functions needed.  The key functions are:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread
        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext


    The prototypes and structures used by this DLL are prototyped in the header
    file VDMDBG.H.  Section 5.0 explains each of these functions.

    Debuggers should not use these APIs to deal with the 16-bit environment:

        GetThreadSelectoryEntry
        GetThreadContext
        SetThreadContext

    The APIs ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory are still useful except
    that the debugger must convert the 16-bit addresses into 32-bit addresses
    (using VDMGetPointer).

    Each and every exception with the exception code of STATUS_VDM_EVENT
    should be passed to the function VDMProcessException.  This function
    filters out the extraneous communication between the 16-bit environment
    and the VDMDBG.DLL.  Most of this extraneous communication a debugger
    can ignore (deals with segment & module loading & unloading, this
    information will be provided via another interface).  If the event is
    part of this communication process, VDMProcessException will return
    FALSE, if not, it will return TRUE.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns FALSE, the debugger can
    immediately call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of
    DBG_CONTINUE and return to waiting for additional debug events.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns TRUE, then the lpArguments
    parameter of the exception should be processed to determine the type of
    event (INT 1, INT 3, INT D, etc.).  The debugger can then act accordingly.
    When it has completed operating with the thread, the debugger should
    call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of DBG_CONTINUE
    or DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED.

    For the processing of each of the debug events, the debugger should use
    the API VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry, VDMGetThreadContext, and
    VDMSetThreadContext instead of the likewise named functions listed above
    that are exported from KERNEL32.DLL.  These functions operate on an x86
    CONTEXT structure, even when running on a non-x86 machine.  The debugger
    should likewise present an x86 debugging view (x86 register dump, x86
    dis-assembly, breakpoints are INT 3's, etc.)

4.0 Communication Protocol via. Exceptions

    The method of communicating between the application and debugger
    will be exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception and debugger should
    receive it.  NTVDM can detect whether or not it is being debugged, and
    will conditionally raise the exception.

    If a debugger attaches itself to an existing NTVDM process, the
    32-bit environment detects this and comminicates an acknowledgement
    of this attachment.  This allows debuggers to perform initialization
    dealing with the 16-bit environment before beginning any new 16-bit tasks.

    For the simulated 16-bit environment, the exception code will always be
    STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    On NT, each exception can only contain up to 4 DWORD values.  Here is
    how they are used for this communication.  The first 2 DWORDs contain
    4 WORD fields.  The last two DWORDs are just DWORDs.

      +---------+
      | W1 | W2 | = DW1
      +---------+
      | W3 | W4 | = DW2
      +---------+
      |   DW3   |
      +---------+
      |   DW4   |
      +---------+

    The header file VDMDBG.H contains macros for isolating the individual
    parts of the exception information.

    The W1 field is a WORD which specifies which type of event has occurred.
    This can be one of the following:

        W1 ==  0 - Segment Load Notification (DBG_SEGLOAD)
        W1 ==  1 - Segment Move Notification (DBG_SEGMOVE)
        W1 ==  2 - Segment Free Notification (DBG_SEGFREE)
        W1 ==  3 - Module Load Notification  (DBG_MODLOAD)
        W1 ==  4 - Module Free Notification  (DBG_MODFREE)
        W1 ==  5 - Int 01h break             (DBG_SINGLESTEP)
        W1 ==  6 - Int 03h break             (DBG_BREAKPOINT)
        W1 ==  7 - Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)  (DBG_GPFAULT)
        W1 ==  8 - Divide Overflow           (DBG_DIVOVERFLOW)
        W1 ==  9 - Invalid Opcode Fault      (DBG_INSTRFAULT)
        W1 == 10 - Task starting             (DBG_TASKSTART)
        W1 == 11 - Task stop                 (DBG_TASKSTOP)
        W1 == 12 - DLL starting              (DBG_DLLSTART)
        W1 == 13 - DLL stop                  (DBG_DLLSTOP)

    They are described below.

    The debugger will probably need to be smart enough to know how to manage
    both protected mode selectors and segment numbers from simulated real mode.

    Segment/selector to symbol lookup should be mode sensitive and only use
    segments from the appropriate mode.

4.1 Segment Load Notification

    Under Win16, this event is used to indicate that a selector has just
    been created and that it maps to a module's segment.

    When a .EXE or .DLL is loaded, many of these events will be received.
    No module load notification event will occur (this is the way it is
    done under Windows 3.1 too).

    Under DOS, no segment load notifications will occur.

        W1  = DBG_SEGLOAD (0)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector assigned to new segment
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Segment within module
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Code/data information from segment definition
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.2 Segment Move Notification

    A segment has changed from one selector number to another.  If the
    new selector number is 0, this should be considered the same as
    discarding (freeing) the segment.

    This event only happens under Win16.  As such, these selectors should be
    tagged as protected mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_SEGMOVE (1)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Old selector number
        Selector2 - New selector number (0 to discard segment)
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.3 Segment Free Notification

    When a segment is being released, this event will be received.

    This event only happens under Win16.

        W1  = DBG_SEGFREE (2)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector number
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.4 Module Load Notification

    This event is used to indicate that a module is going to take up a
    range of memory.

    This event is used only under DOS.  As such, these segment numbers
    should be tagged as simulated real mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_MODLOAD (3)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Starting segment
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Length of module (in bytes)

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.5 Module Free Notification

    Module freeing notifications happen under both DOS and Win16.  For
    to determine which selectors to free for a Win16 application, all of the
    selectors must be scanned to determine if it was associated with this
    module.  Again, this is the way it is done under Windows 3.1.

        W1  = DBG_MODFREE (4)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.6 Int 01h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoint, trace bit setting mechanisms.

        W1  = DBG_SINGLE_STEP (5)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.7 Int 03h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_BREAKPOINT (6)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.8 Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_GPFAULT (7)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    It is also important to note that all GP Faults will not be sent via
    this interface.  The Win16 subsystem intercepts some of the GP faults
    in its parameter validation code.  Faults in the parameter validation
    code indicated that an invalid parameter is being passed to one of the
    16-bit APIs.  There is currently no way to intercept these faults, the
    APIs will just return errors in the same mechanism as under Windows 3.1.

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.9 Divide Overflow break (Int 0)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_DIVOVERFLOW (8)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.A Invalid Opcode Fault (Int 6)

        W1  = DBG_INSTRFAULT (9)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.B Task starting

4.F Attach Acknowlegement

    Once the 16-bit environment has detected that a debugger is present
    it sends this event to allow the debugger to perform any initialization
    processing specific to the 16-bit environment.

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

5.0 The VDM debugging APIs

    These APIs are described below:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMEnumProcessWOW
        VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The following APIs require WOWDEB.EXE to be loaded and running in the
    Win16 subsystem.  WOWDEB.EXE is started automatically if the debugger
    is present at process creation time (CreateProcess with debug options
    set). If the debugger is attached to the Win16 subsystem process after
    the process has already been created (with the DebugActiveProcess API),
    then the debugger should spawn WOWDEB.EXE before starting the Win16 task
    to be debugged.

        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext

    This following APIs are obsolete.  They return failure conditions.

        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread

5.1 VDMProcessException

    BOOL VDMProcessException(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent
    );

    The VDMProcessExecption function performs the pre-processing needed to
    prepare the debug event for handling by the debugger.

    This function filters all VDM debugee/debugger communication for
    information which is only used by the VDM debugging DLL (VDMDBG.DLL).
    This function is only valid in the context of processing for debug
    events that are of type STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    The return value is TRUE if the debug event should be processed by the
    debugger.

    The return value is FALSE if the debug event should be ignored.  This
    This indicates that no processing should occur for this debug event.
    The event should be continued using ContinueDebugEvent with a continue
    status of DBG_CONTINUE.

5.2 VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry

    BOOL VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector
        LPLDT_ENTRY     lpSelectorEntry
    );

    This function is used to return a descriptor table entry for the
    specified VDM thread corresponding to the specified selector.  This
    function is simimlar to the API GetThreadSelectorEntry except that
    it works on the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment, and it works on all
    systems, not just x86 systems.

    This API returns a simulated descriptor entry on non-x86 systems.
    Simulated descriptor entrys may (on some systems) have the base value
    adjusted to account for the fact that the simulated address space may
    not begin at linear (32-bit) address 0.

    It is also important to note that 16-bit applications may modify
    the contents of the LDT entries.  For example, the Win16 subsystem
    may change the selector's base value to coalesce discontinous memory
    segments.  Also, please see the description in VDMGetPointer.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.  The selector
                    value may be a global selector (GDT) or a local selector
                    (LDT).

    lpSelectorEntry If the specifed selector is contained within the
                    thread's descriptor tables, its descriptor table entry
                    is copied into the data structure pointed to by this
                    parameter.  This data can be used to compute the linear
                    base address that segment relative addresses refer to.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by lpSelectorEntry receives a copy of the
    specified descriptor table entry.

    Refer to the WinHelp entry for the structure of an LDT_ENTRY.

5.3 VDMGetPointer

    ULONG VDMGetPointer(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        DWORD           dwOffset,
        BOOL            fProtMode
    );

    This function is used to convert a 16-bit address into a flat 32-bit
    address.

    It is also very important to note that under the WIN16 environment,
    pointers derived from protected mode selectors may change.  WIN16 does
    this by changing selector's base value to coalesce memory during
    compaction.  For this reason, it is necessary that any addresses
    evaluated in the 16-bit environment should be reevaluated each time
    an access into 16-bit memory is needed.  An example would be
    placing and removing 16-bit breakpoint instructions.  If the debugger
    is told to place a breakpoint at a given address of SEL:OFFSET, then
    when the breakpoint is needs to be removed, the debugger must reevaluate
    the SEL:OFFSET address since it might have moved in terms of the linear
    32-bit address.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to determine the pointer for.

    dwOffset        Supplies the offset value to determine the pointer for.

    fProtMode       Indicates whether the 16-bit address specified is a
                    real mode (v86 mode) address or a protected mode address.
                    Protected mode addresses are translated through the
                    descriptor tables.

    The return value is a 32-bit linear address pointing to the memory
    in the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment that represents the 16-bit address
    specified.  The return value is NULL, if the address specified is invalid.
    On some systems, NULL may be returned for the address 0:0.

    To determine the address of the simulated 16-bit memory, VDMGetPointer
    may be called with the address 0:0 and an fProtMode of FALSE.

5.4 VDMGetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMGetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The context of a specified simulated DOS or WIN16 thread can be
    retrieved using VDMGetThreadContext.  The context returned will
    always be that of an x86 system.

    This API returns a simulated context for x86 and non-x86 systems.
    Under some systems, values within the context are meaningless.  For
    example, the CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS portions on RISC systems have
    no effect.

    Release 1 of Windows NT has a 286 emulator on RISC systems.  For this
    reason, only the 16-bit registers can be supported on RISC systems.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    If the specified thread is a simulated DOS or WIN16
                    thread, its context is copied into the data structure
                    pointed to by this parameter.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by <lpVDMContext> receives a copy of the
    simulated context.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.5 VDMSetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMSetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The VDMSetThreadContext function sets the simulated context in the
    specified DOS or WIN16 thread.  The function allows selective context
    to be set based on the value of the ContextFlags member of the context
    structure.  This API operates only when debugging a simulated DOS or
    WIN16 thread.  The caller must have a thread handle which was created
    with THREAD_SET_CONTEXT access.

    The context set will always be that of an x86 system.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    Supplies the address of a context structure that
                    contains the context that is to be set in the specified
                    thread.  The value of the ContextFlags member of this
                    structure specifies which portions of a thread's context
                    are to be set.  Some values in the context structure are
                    not settable and are silently set to the correct values.
                    This include CPU status register bits that specify
                    processor mode, debug register global enabling bits, and
                    other state that must be completely controlled by the
                    system.

    The return value is TRUE if the context was set; otherwise it is FALSE if
    an error occurred.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.6 VDMGetSelectorModule

    BOOL VDMGetSelectorModule(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        PUINT           lpSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        UINT            nSize,
        LPSTR           lpModulePath,
        UINT            nPathSize
    );

    The VDMGetSelectorModule function is intended to provide an interface
    such that debuggers can determine which module belongs to a code or
    data address.  Given the selector for that address, the function will
    return the module name, and the segment number (0 based) of the segment
    that corresponds to that selector.  If the selector is not a selector
    which directly corresponds to a module, the function will return FALSE.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.

    lpSegmentNumber Returns the segment number within the module.

    lpModuleName    Buffer to receive the module name.

    nModuleSize     Size of the buffer.

    lpModulePath    Buffer to receive the module path name.

    nPathSize       Size of the buffer.

    The return value is TRUE if the selector is mapped directly to a module.
    This means it must be either a code or data segment.  Selectors allocated
    using the global memory management functions are not mapped directly to
    a module.  The return value is FALSE if the function is not successful.

    The function returns the segment number in the address specified by
    the lpSegmentNumber parameter, and the module name in the address
    specified by the lpModuleName parameter.

    It is up to the debugger to determine from the module and segment number
    information the correct symbol, if a symbol lookup is needed.

5.7 VDMGetModuleSelector

    BOOL VDMGetModuleSelector(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        UINT            uSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        LPWORD          lpSelector
    );

    The VDMGetModuleSelector function is the reverse operation of the
    VDMGetSelectorModule function.  A module name and segment number
    are converted into a selector number.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    uSegmentNumber  Supplies the segment number to look up.

    lpModuleName    Specifies the module name of the segment.

    lpSelector      Returns the selector value.

    The return value is TRUE if the module and segment are found.  Also,
    the lpSelector value is filled-in with the selector of that segment.
    Otherwise, the return value is FALSE.

    It is up to the debugger to convert symbol names and expressions into
    modules, segment numbers and offsets.  Usings the modules and segment
    numbers, a selector value can be determined.  In combination with the
    offset, the selector can be used to index into the simulated Win16
    environment for reading, writing, etc.

5.8 VDMEnumProcessWOW

    INT VDMEnumProcessWOW(
        PROCESSENUMPROC fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumProcessWOW function enumerates all of the processes in
    the system which are Win16 subsystem processes.  In NT's first release,
    there is only one Win16 subsystem.  For later releases, there may be
    more than one process to support address space seperation for Win16
    tasks.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 subsystem processes, or the
    number enumerated before enumeration was terminated.

    BOOL ProcessEnumProc(
        DWORD           dwProcessId,
        DWORD           dwAttributes,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 subsystem process
    in the system.

    dwProcessId     Provides the process id of a Win16 subsystem.

    dwAttributes    Provides flags indicating information about the process.

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumProcessWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.

    The dwAttributes field should be compared with the bit mask WOW_SYSTEM
    to determine if the process is the main Win16 subsystem process.  The
    main Win16 subsystem process will be the process that the next Win16
    task that specifies no address space seperation requirements.

    Win16 subsystem processes which are created due to address space
    seperation will not have the WOW_SYSTEM bit enabled.

5.9 VDMEnumTaskWOW

    INT
    VDMEnumTaskWOW(
        DWORD           dwProcessId,
        TASKENUMPROC    fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumTaskWOW function enumerates all of the Win16 tasks currently
    running in the Win16 subsystem process id specified.

    dwProcessId     Supplies the process id of the Win16 subsystem.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 tasks or the number of
    tasks enumerated before terminating.

    BOOL TaskEnumProc(
        DWORD           dwThreadId,
        WORD            hMod16,
        WORD            hTask16,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 task.

    dwThreadId      Provides the thread id of the Win16 task

    hMod16          Provides the Win16 module handle for the task

    hTask16         Provides the Win16 task handle for the task

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.

5.A VDMModuleFirst

    BOOL VDMModuleFirst(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        LPMODULEENTRY   lpModuleEntry,
        DEBUGEVENTPROC  lpEventProc,
        LPVOID          lpData
    );

    This function is used to start enumerating all of the modules currently
    loaded in the 16-bit Windows environment.  It behaves in the same manner
    as the Windows 3.1 ToolHelp API ModuleFirst().

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    lpModuleEntry   Specifies the address of a MODULEENTRY structure which
                    will be filled in with the first module in the module
                    list.

    lpEventProc     Specifies the address of a procedure which might be
                    called in the event of a debug event occuring while
                    the communication session with the 16-bit enviroment
                    is occurring.

    lpData          Specifies a parameter to pass to the debug event procudure

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the MODULEENTRY structure will be filled in with information for the
    first module in the module list.

5.B VDMModuleNext

    BOOL VDMModuleNext(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        LPMODULEENTRY   lpModuleEntry,
        DEBUGEVENTPROC  lpEventProc,
        LPVOID          lpData
    );

    This function is used to continue enumerating all of the modules currently
    loaded in the 16-bit Windows environment.  It behaves in the same manner
    as the Windows 3.1 ToolHelp API ModuleNext().

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    lpModuleEntry   Specifies the address of a MODULEENTRY structure which
                    will be used to determine the next module and which will
                    be filled in with the next module in the module list.

    lpEventProc     Specifies the address of a procedure which might be
                    called in the event of a debug event occuring while
                    the communication session with the 16-bit enviroment
                    is occurring.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6E:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\TECH2.DOT s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.09 Microsoft Word 6.0s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.13 NOTE: This is BETA software, no shipping version will be version 2.13. Once this passes by all the interested parties, and the bugs are worked out, I will release the version. It will most likely be called version 2.50 since it changes the subclassing technique used.  I will be filling in the details of the new functions and features, for now I am VERY interested in knowing if this version breaks any existing applications. Please try the new version with your current products to see if anything has been upset by the new release of ctl3d. New Functions Ctl3dSubclassCtlEx(HWND hwnd, int ct) Subclasses the specified window using the window type given in ct. These can be: CTL3D_BUTTON_CTL Button  CTL3D_LISTBOX_CTL Listbox CTL3D_EDIT_CTL Edit Control CTL3D_COMBO_CTL  Combo Box CTL3D_STATIC_CTL Static Control This function is meant to be use to subclass superclassed ( or cloned ) classes. If you superclass the edit control to make your own edit control ( MyEDIT ) you can use this function to do the subclass. This API does not perform checking on style bits and such to see if the control would normally be subclassed by ctl3d. This means it is very easy to get into trouble using this function.  Ctl3dUnsubclassCtl(HWND hwnd) This funciton will remove ctl3d s subclass from the specified window. Ctl3d s subclass can only be removed if there are no other subclasses on the window after ctl3d s subclass. In other words, if the window has been subclassed by anyone after ctl3d has subclassed the window, the subclass will not be removed. Ctl3d will disable itself in this case. Ctl3dIsAutoSubclass(void) Want to know if this application has already been autosubclassed ? This function will return TRUE if it is. Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass(void) Want to turn off automatic subclassing, may only while you create this particular dialog ? This funciton is what you want. It will turn off autosubclassing.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6E:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\TECH2.DOT s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.09 Microsoft Word 6.0s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.13 NOTE: This is BETA software, no shipping version will be version 2.13. Once this passes by all the interested parties, and the bugs are worked out, I will release the version. It will most likely be called version 2.50 since it changes the subclassing technique used.  I will be filling in the details of the new functions and features, for now I am VERY interested in knowing if this version breaks any existing applications. Please try the new version with your current products to see if anything has been upset by the new release of ctl3d. New Functions Ctl3dSubclassCtlEx(HWND hwnd, int ct) Subclasses the specified window using the window type given in ct. These can be: CTL3D_BUTTON_CTL Button  CTL3D_LISTBOX_CTL Listbox CTL3D_EDIT_CTL Edit Control CTL3D_COMBO_CTL  Combo Box CTL3D_STATIC_CTL Static Control This function is meant to be use to subclass superclassed ( or cloned ) classes. If you superclass the edit control to make your own edit control ( MyEDIT ) you can use this function to do the subclass. This API does not perform checking on style bits and such to see if the control would normally be subclassed by ctl3d. This means it is very easy to get into trouble using this function.  Ctl3dUnsubclassCtl(HWND hwnd) This funciton will remove ctl3d s subclass from the specified window. Ctl3d s subclass can only be removed if there are no other subclasses on the window after ctl3d s subclass. In other words, if the window has been subclassed by anyone after ctl3d has subclassed the window, the subclass will not be removed. Ctl3d will disable itself in this case. Ctl3dIsAutoSubclass(void) Want to know if this application has already been autosubclassed ? This function will return TRUE if it is. Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass(void) Want to turn off automatic subclassing, may only while you create this particular dialog ? This funciton is what you want. It will turn off autosubclassing. However if another part of the application has also turned on automatic subclassing, then Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass may not remove the automatic subclassing. This funciton is meant to be used by DLLs who need to use automatic subclassing.

The document breifly describes DdeStrs.exe.

DdeStrs is intended to exercise and stress Dde/Ddeml.

Some areas exercised in the test are ...

    o  Async/fAckRequest advise loops
    o  Async executes
    o  CF_TEXT, CF_DIB, CF_BITMAP, CF_METAFILEPICT, CF_PALETTE,
       and CF_ENHMETAFILE (w32 only) formats.
    o  DdeConnectList/DdeDisconnectList
    o  AppOwned handles [when -a option used]
    o  Variable client/server connects (number of instances running
       of ddestrs.exe)
    o  Cross process/In process and multithread communication.
    o  System Timers


The command line options are ...

DdeStrs [-#%,-e#,-t#,-d,-a,-s,-c,-f#,-nNAME,-i#,-p,-?]

    where -#% allow the user to specify the intensity of
	the run (# = [1...100]) and can be read as stress
	percentage.  1 being low stress 100 being high stress.

    where -e# allows override of the delay set by the stress
	level.	-e0 is usefull if the stress test is the only one
	running and it is desirable for the test to cover ground
	(number of windows, classes, and messages that are
	exercised).  # is in milliseconds.

    where -t# specifies the number of minutes for the test to run.  At
	the end of # minutes the test will shutdown.  Default is 4320 min
	(About a weekend).  Test can also be exited manually at any
	point.

    where -d selects debug mode.  This mode of operation displays
	additional test information and outputs failures to
	the debug terminal.  This mode is intended for debugging
	DdeStrs failures and not for use in public stress runs.

    where -a specifies to use AppOwned handle for data communications.

    where -s specifies that this instance is to run as server only
	[default is -s -c].

    where -c specifies that this instance is to run as client only.
	[default is -s -c].

    where -f# allow specific formats to be used.  Default is all
	formats.  If any specific formats are specified then only
	to formats will be used in the communication.

	[Ex - ddestrs -f1 -f2] will only use formats 1 and 2.

	Formats    1  CF_TEXT
		   2  CF_DIB
		   3  CF_BITMAP
		   4  CF_ENHMETAFILE  (w32 only)
		   5  CF_METAFILEPICT
		   6  CF_PALETTE

    where -nNAME specifies the computer name to connect to.  This
	is used for netdde and only needs to be specified on client
	applications.  NAME=servername, Example '-njohnsp1' for
	computer \\johnsp1.  Use Ddeshare.exe (w31 resources kit or
	Nt sdk) to setup the dde share enabling netdde to work.  DdeStrs
	Service Name=DdeStrs, Topic=Test, and permissions must be
	change or greater (ddestrs.exe uses executes).

    where -i# specifies the number of threads to execute.  # can
	be in the range [1..5].  This option is only available
	for Win Nt.

    where -p specifies pause before data update.  With this specified the user can
	manually start executes and advise updates.  With this connections are established, but
	no data is passed until manually started. DdeStrs adds a 'pause' button to allow stress
	to be started and stopped.  Default is NO -p.

    where -? brings up a brief help list of DdeStrs Options.

Test Usage ...

    Ddestrs will communicate with multiple copies of itself.  Each
    new instance of ddestrs started will cause other instances to
    connect to all running copies available for conversation.  This
    allows the stress level to be tailored both by the -#% and
    by the number of copies of the test running.

Header File Organization
        ------------------------

This document describes the rules for public Windows 3.1 header files.  These
rules are designed to promote consistency, clarity, Win32 compatibility, ANSI
compatibility, motherhood, and apple pie a la mode.

In the past, windows.h has been fairly randomly organized: it wasn't very
easy to look in the file and figure out how constants, types, and functions
are related.  However, the new windows.h is much more rationally organized,
and it's now far easier to understand and modify.  In interests of
consistency, readability, and maintainability, it's important that all of our
public header files are consistently organized.

    *  Include a copyright banner at the top of the file.  Something like:

/*****************************************************************************\
*                                                                             *
* header.h -    Brief description of purpose of header file                   *
*                                                                             *
*               Version 3.10                                                  *                   *
*                                                                             *
*               Copyright (c) 1992, Microsoft Corp.  All rights reserved.     *
*                                                                             *
\*****************************************************************************/

       If this header file has been released before, the copyright date
       should be something like: 1985-1992.

    *  Arrange your header in functional groups, like windows.h.  Try to
       keep related types, structures, constants and functions as close
       together as possible in the header.  Separate functional groups
       within the header with a banner comment, as in windows.h.

    *  Within a functional group, general typedefs and constants should come
       first, followed by logically organized function prototypes.

    *  Constants or types used by only one or two functions should be
       declared near the function.

    *  Make sure that everything defined in the header file is included by
       default: don't require people to #define things to get certain
       definitions.

    *  If you do want to break up your header file, use the #define NOXXX
       convention used by windows.h.  Try not to have too many groups
       controled by NOXXX #defines, because they get confusing and hard to
       deal with.  Compiler speed and memory capacity is not the problem it
       once was, especially with precompiled headers.

    *  Constants designed to be ANDed or ORed should be defined in hex.
       The number of digits should reflect the data size: 2 for bytes,
       4 for words, and 8 for longs.  Long hex constants should have
       an appended L, e.g., 0x12345678L.

    *  Ordinal constants values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) should be declared
       in decimal.

    *  Provide a comment on all #else's and #endif's that suggests its
       corresponding #ifdef: e.g.

            #ifdef FOO
            ...
            #else   /* FOO */

            #endif  /* !FOO */

    *  Precede the header file with #pragma pack(1), and terminate with
       #pragma pack().  This ensures that the structures declared in the
       header will be packed properly, regardless of what compiler packing
       options the user is using for his own code.  Because the Windows RC
       compiler chokes on #pragma statements in .rc files, it's a good idea
       to include this (and any other #pragmas) in an #ifndef RC_INVOKED.

            #ifndef RC_INVOKED
            #pragma pack(1)         /* Assume byte packing throughout */
            #endif  /* RC_INVOKED */

       and:

            #ifndef RC_INVOKED
            #pragma pack()          /* Revert to default packing */
            #endif  /* RC_INVOKED */

    *  Prevent multiple inclusion of your header file with the following
       construct:

            #ifndef _INC_MYHEADER
            #define _INC_MYHEADER

            ...body of header...

            #endif  /* _INC_MYHEADER */

       This is the convention used by the C runtimes.  For each header there
       is a #define that can be used to determine whether the header has
       already been included.



        Win32 Upward Compatibility
        --------------------------

Part of the goal of 3.1 is to provide a more unified API that will scale with
minimal pain to 32 bits in Win32.  To this end, there are a few things you
have to worry about in your headers (and in your code, but that's a different
story...)

In 32-bit Windows, almost all 16 bit parameters, return values, and field
types have been widened to 32 bits.  This allows us to generate much more
efficient code on the 386 and on RISC machines.

We need a way of declaring the quantities that will "float" to 32 bits in
32-bit Windows.  It turns out that the C language already provides for this
capability: the "int" type, for example, is 16 bits on 16 bit platforms, but
is 32 bits on 32 bit platforms.  "short" is always 16 bits on any platform,
"long" is always 32 bits, and "char" is always 8 bits.

So, functions and structures with "int" declarations are already portably
declared.  The problem, though is with the WORD type.  "WORD" has become an
industry-wide synonym for a 16 bit unsigned quantity.  But, it's also used
widely in Windows header files.

Enter the UINT type.  The new UINT type is typedef'd as "unsigned int": an
unsigned value that is 16 bits on 16 bit platforms, and floats to 32 bits on
32 bit platforms.  In the 3.1 headers, UINT is used in place of WORD wherever
the size of the return value, parameter, or field will change depending on
the platform.

This is a rule that applies to code you write too: on 32 bit platforms, use
of the UINT type rather than WORD will generate faster smaller code.  But be
careful of hard-coded size dependencies on WORD: be sure to use sizeof()
instead of constants, etc.

In some cases there may be structure fields whose size WON'T be changing in
32-bit windows, perhaps because the structure is used in a file format and
compatibility is required.  If you know ahead of time that this is the case,
be sure to use short and WORD to indicate 16 bit quantities across platforms.
There are a few of these exceptions with the 3.1 bitmap information
structures in windows.h.  If you don't know, then use UINT and int.

The new WPARAM, LPARAM, and LRESULT types, used for polymorphic or arbitrary
parameters and return values (e.g., the SendMessage() function), also provide
a useful degree of platform isolation.  The WPARAM type is similar to UINT in
that its size varies with the platform.  WPARAM should be used in function
parameter, return value, AND structure declarations, even though its size may
vary.  The use of these types indicates to the programmer that the value must
be cast and assigned to the proper type before use.

Hence, the following rules:

    *  Use int and UINT instead of short or WORD, UNLESS you know for sure
       that the quantity will remain 16 bits in 32-bit Windows.  The Windows
       HIWORD and LOWORD macros use WORD, for example.  Be sure to check your
       uses of short as well as WORD: there are probably a few lurking out
       there that should be changed to int.  Use int FAR* or UINT FAR* instead
       of LPINT or LPWORD.

    *  Use the LPARAM, WPARAM, and LRESULT types instead of WORD, LONG, or
       DWORD as appropriate.


        ANSI Compatibility
        ------------------

Public header files should be ANSI compliant so that people can take
advantage of the highest compiler warning levels possible.  This also helps
ensure that our header files work with a wider range of development tools.

    *  Don't define constants, typedefs, or functions named with a preceding
       underscore.  This violates the ANSI namespace conventions.  There are
       a few violations of this rule already in existence (e.g., _lread), but
       try not to create any new problems.  (The rules are actually more
       complicated than "don't use underscores", but you're safe if you keep
       away from them).

    *  Don't use "//" style comments in the header: these are convenient
       but non-ANSI, and warning level 4 complains.

    *  Always test your header file by compiling it with the -W4 compiler
       option to ensure that it's ANSI-compatible.

    *  Make sure that you have no identifier conflicts with the following
       C library header files (NOTE: This list may be incomplete.  It's
       a good start, though).

            assert.h
            ctype.h
            errno.h
            float.h
            limits.h
            locale.h
            math.h
            setjmp.h
            signal.h
            stdarg.h
            stddef.h
            stdio.h
            stdlib.h
            string.h
            time.h

    *  Structure declarations should be declared with the "tag" prefix, rather
       than a leading underscore, as shown below:

         typedef struct tagFOO
         {
            int i;
            UINT u;
         } FOO;

    *  Declare fully-prototyped typedefs for all callback functions.  By
       convention, the type name should be all caps and end in PROC. For
       example, the window procedure callback function typedef from windows.h:

        typedef LRESULT (CALLBACK* WNDPROC)(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);

        Windows 3.0 Backward Compatibility
        ----------------------------------

In order to allow users to develop applications with 3.1 headers that will
still run on 3.0, users can #define the WINVER constant to be equal to the
version number of Windows they are compiling against.  For 3.0, this would be
0x0300.  This constant should be used to ensure that new, non-3.0 compatible
features are not declared when the user is compiling a 3.0 application.  Keep
in mind that this version number is hex, not decimal (to be compatible with
the GetExpWinVer() API).

Some of you may own headers that are designed to work with windows 3.0 as
well as 3.1: in this case, you won't have some of the new 3.1 typedefs and
macros defined (e.g., UINT).  You can use #ifdef _INC_WINDOWS to determine
whether you've included the 3.1 windows.h.  Because yours may not be the only
header that will want to define certain types like UINT and LPCSTR, you
should #define these to be WORD and LPSTR, respectively, since you cannot
typedef something twice.  The other option, of course, is to have separate
3.0 and 3.1 versions of your header.

    *  New, non-3.0 compatible declarations and definitions should be inside
       #ifdef (WINVER >= 0x030a)/#endif so that the 3.1 headers can be used
       to create 3.0-compatible applications.

    *  If your header must be compatible with the 3.0 windows.h, use #ifdef
       _INC_WINDOWS around #definitions that define the missing types.  The
       3.0 windows.h file did not #define _INC_WINDOWS.
       Use #define rather than typedef to ensure that other headers can
       safely do the same thing.  Here's an example that will handle
       most of the common problems:

        #ifndef _INC_WINDOWS    /* If not included with 3.1 headers... */
        #define LPCSTR      LPSTR
        #define WINAPI      FAR PASCAL
        #define CALLBACK    FAR PASCAL
        #define UINT        WORD
        #define LPARAM      LONG
        #define WPARAM      WORD
        #define LRESULT     LONG
        #define HMODULE     HANDLE
        #define HINSTANCE   HANDLE
        #define HLOCAL      HANDLE
        #define HGLOBAL     HANDLE
        #endif  /* _INC_WINDOWS */

        C++ Compatibility
        -----------------

To be able to use functions declared in your header directly from C++, you
need to do one thing:

    *  Bracket the header file typedefs inside an extern "c" {} block,
       conditionally using the __cplusplus #define:
       Near the beginning of your header:

        #ifdef __cplusplus
        extern "C" {            /* Assume C declarations for C++ */
        #endif  /* __cplusplus */

       And at the end:

        #ifdef __cplusplus
        }
        #endif


        STRICT Compatibility and Windows 3.0 Backward Compatibility
        -----------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important features of STRICT is that handle types are no
longer defined as WORDs.  They are declared in such a way that will cause a
compiler error if you try to pass the wrong type of handle or a non-handle
value to a function, for example.  It's important that all of our handle
types be declared this way when the user #defines STRICT.

A number of new types and such have been defined in windows.h, such as
HINSTANCE, HGLOBAL, and HLOCAL, which should be used where appropriate in
place of the generic HANDLE type.  HANDLE should be used only in cases of
an arbitrary handle type.

The WPARAM, LPARAM, and LRESULT types should be used for arbitrary or
polymorphic parameters or return values. Typedefs exist for all callback
functions, which are used in place of FARPROC.

In most cases, functions declared with these types are fully 3.0 compatible
unless STRICT is #defined.  It may sometimes be necessary to use #ifdef
STRICT/#else/#endif to provide 3.0-compatible, non-STRICT declarations in
some cases.

    *  Use DECLARE_HANDLE() to declare handle types.  If you have polymorphic
       API parameters (or structure fields) that are designed to accept more
       than one type of handle (e.g., the GDI SelectObject function), there
       are a few tricks you can employ.  1) Declare a generic handle type
       like HGDIOBJ as void _near*, which will accept any handle type. The
       HANDLE type can be used for this purpose.  2) if the number of
       polymorphic types is small, and there are lots of cases where they can
       be used polymorphically, use DECLARE_HANDLE to declare one handle
       type, and typedef the rest to be the same as the first one (e.g,
       HMODULE and HINSTANCE in windows.h).

    *  Structure and function declarations should use the appropriate STRICT
       type, rather than the generic HANDLE,

    *  Declare arbitrarily or polymorphic types with LPARAM, WPARAM, and
       LRESULT instead of WORD, LONG, or DWORD.  This indicates to a
       programmer that these values should not be used directly, but should
       instead be cast and assigned to the proper type of value before use.

    *  Declare arbitrarily or polymorphic pointer types with void FAR*
       instead of LPSTR or BYTE FAR*.  The nice thing about the void FAR*
       type is that you can pass any type of pointer to it without having to
       cast first.

    *  If any of the above STRICT rules result in declarations that are
       not compatible with previously released versions of the header file,
       use #ifdef STRICT/#else/#endif to ensure that both declarations
       are present.

    *  Use WINAPI instead of FAR PASCAL for declaring APIs.  Use CALLBACK
       instead of FAR PASCAL in callback function typedefs.

    *  Be sure to use "const" where appropriate in your pointer parameters.
       If the pointer is read-only, then it should be const.  If the function
       writes through the pointer, it must not be const.  For const
       zero-terminated string pointers, use LPCSTR instead of LPSTR.

    *  Don't declare NPXXX or SPXXX pointer parameter types for new structures.
       (but don't remove them if they've already been defined in a shipped
       header).  Users are encouraged to use "*", const, _near, _far, and
       _huge explicitly where appropriate.  Now that our headers contain
       "const" pointer types, having LP, NP, and const pointer type variants
       for every structure would just clog the compiler up with typedefs.

    *  Spell out pointer declarations, rather than using the LPXXX type form.
       This allows for use of const and _huge where appropriate, without
       having to define lots of new typedefs:

             SetFoo(const FOO FAR* pfoo);
             GetFoo(FOO FAR* pfoo);

    *  Use parameter names in your API function prototypes.  This greatly
       contributes to the readability and usefulness of your header, at
       very little cost.  Make sure all your APIs and callback declarations
       are fully prototyped.  Use the same naming conventions as in our
       documentation (contact gregro or ralphw for a summary of those
       conventions).  NOTE: As of this writing, windows.h does not yet
       include function prototype names.

New Executable Format

DOS 2.0 Windows will define a new executable format for .EXE files
that is a superset of the current DOS 2.0 .EXE format.  The purpose
of this new format is to provide the additional information needed
to support the new dynamic linking and segmentation facilities provided
by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  In order for Windows and DOS 4.0
to recognize the new executable format, the existing .EXE format
will be used with a slight modification:

    - the word at offset 18h in the existing .EXE file contains the
      relative byte offset to the relocation table.  If this offset
      is 40h, then that identifies this as a new format .EXE file and
      The word at offset 24h is the relative byte offset from the
      beginning of the file to the beginning of the new format
      executable header.  The remainder of the old format header will
      describe a small program that will either print an error message
      or bring in a loader that can handle the job.  See the picture
      below for the actual file layout.

    - this format will only be used for .EXE files that use the new
      memory model supported by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  Old .EXE
      files will continue with the DOS 2.0 file format, as modified
      by the DOS 4.0 group.  In that format, the DOS 4.0 behavior bits
      (2 bytes) are stored at offset 20h.

The format of the new .EXE file format looks like:

         |  point is its ordinal within the entry table, counting the

         |  bundles until it finds the bundle containing the entry point;
         |  the loader can then multiply by entry size to index the
         |  proper entry.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\base\mvdm\wow16\kernel31\patch.txt ===
This is an overview document describing how to create module patches
in Windows 95.

Legal aspects:
--------------
While we are obviously using this module-patching technology to
make already-shipping apps run or run better, it is possible
for us to make a mistake and wrongly patch a module. For example,
there might be two similar versions of an app which need to be
patched differently, but we only know about one of them. Due to the
obvious liability concerns, we need to obtain authorization from
the app vendor for each module patch we put into the registry.
The letter must specify the name of the module, the number of the
segment taking the patch, the bytes being replaced, and the new
bytes taking their place. The letter can be from any responsible
person at the vendor, eg. an engineer who is familiar with the code.
At the same time, talking to the vendor will help us find out how
many different versions there are of an app, so we can figure out
how to patch each one.

See brianrey if you have a module patch you want to check in.
It would be a good idea to get the ball rolling on getting the
letter as soon as possible after you know what the patch is, since
it can sometimes take a while to get these things taken care of.
We already get similar letters for app-hack bits.


How to check in a patch:
------------------------
Since the patch values go in the registry, and since the initial registry
contents are owned by setup, you must work with Andy Hill to get your
module patches checked in.

A common mistake when adding app-patches to msbase.inx is to leave out
field 4 (field 3 if you are a computer), which are flags.  The reason
for the confusion is the flag that means "This is a binary regkey" is 01,
and the opcode for "Change" is also 01, so everything just shifts down
one step and nobody gets hurt.  Except that the patch doesn't work.
eg: If you want to add a key whose value is <01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15>
WRONG
    HKLM,"SYSTEM\...",Change,01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15
BETTER
    HKLM,"SYSTEM\...",Change,1,01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15


How to make a patch:
--------------------
All definitions of the structures used below are in core\kernel\patch.asm.

The loader knows to look in the registry for patch data if the MCF_MODPATCH
bit is set in the [ModuleCompatibility] section in win.ini.
eg.
[ModuleCompatibility]
GENERIC=0x0002

All registry keys and values for module-patching are stored
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH:
(from dev\sdk\inc\regstr.h)
#define REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH "System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SessionManager\\AppPatches"

The actual patches are values stored in the registry under
REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH\<mod_name>\<signature>\<segment_number>
where
    mod_name        = the module name
    signature       = a signature string identifying the module version
    segment_number  = the hex number of the segment receiving the patches


Signatures:
-----------
Signatures are strings of ANSI characters representing hex numbers
in nibble-swapped byte format (what you see in wdeb386 if you type
db). Blanks and commas are ignored, and may be included for readability.

The easiest way to create a signature is to run dev\tools\binw\gensig.
eg. If you want to patch segment 3 in foo.dll, run "gensig foo.exe 3"
and a tight signature will be written to stdout.

type-1 and -2 signatures:
A type-1 signature specifies a list of byte sequences with byte offsets
(type-2 has word offsets) which must all match for the signature to match.
A 0 byte-count marks the end of the list.
A match-any-file signature is "0100".
eg. signature = "01 02,00,4e,45 02,3e,0a,03 00" is a type-1 signature which
                 || || || || || || || || || ||
    type --------++ || || || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || || || ||
    offset-------------++ || || || || || || ||
    match bytes-----------++-++ || || || || ||
                                || || || || ||
    byte count------------------++ || || || ||
    offset-------------------------++ || || ||
    match bytes-----------------------++-++ ||
                                            ||
    terminating byte count------------------++
matches if the 2 bytes starting at offset 0 in the exe header match
4e,45 ("NE") and if the 2 bytes starting at offset 3e match 0a,03.
Note- DO NOT include a match on NE in your signature. This is just
for illustrative purposes. The windows version and size(s) of the
segment(s) being patched are good candidates.


type-3, -4 and -5 signatures:
Type-3, -4 and -5 signatures are similar to type-1 and -2 signatures,
except that the offsets are offsets in the module file. Type-3 takes
word offsets, type-4 takes 3-byte offsets, and type-5 takes dword offsets.
eg. signature = "03,03,67,05,c2,0a,00,00"
                 || || || || || || || ||
    type---------++ || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || ||
    file offset--------++-++ || || || ||
    match bytes--------------++-++-++ ||
                                      ||
    terminating byte count------------++
matches if the 3 bytes at offset 567h in the file match c2,0a,00.


type-6, -7 and -8 signatures:
Type-6, -7 and -8 signatures specify the file size of the matching
module. The number of bytes used to specify the matching file size
is 2, 3 or 4 respectively.
eg. signature = "06,d0,0c"
                 || || ||
    type---------++ || ||
    file size-------++-++
matches if the file size is 0cd0h.


type-ff signatures:
Type-ff signatures are meta-signatures and consist of a list of the
other types of signatures. Each list element consists of a byte count
and a sub-signature. A 0 byte-count ends the list.
eg. signature = "ff 06,01,02,3e,0a,03,00 03,06,d0,0c 00"
                 || || || || || || || || || || || || ||
    type---------++ || || || || || || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || || || || || || ||
    sub-type-----------++ || || || || || || || || || ||
    sub-byte-count--------++ || || || || || || || || ||
    hExe offset--------------++ || || || || || || || ||
    match bytes-----------------++-++ || || || || || ||
    sub-type terminator---------------++ || || || || ||
                                         || || || || ||
    byte count---------------------------++ || || || ||
    sub-type--------------------------------++ || || ||
    file size----------------------------------++-++ ||
                                                     ||
    terminating byte count---------------------------++
matches if the 2 bytes at offset 3eh in the exe header match 0a,03
and the file size is 0cd0h.


Criteria for selecting a signature:
-----------------------------------
In terms of time required to validate a signature, the hExe types are
the fastest, the file size types are next-fastest, and the file data
types are the slowest. A signature specifying the expected Windows
version (hExe offset 3e) and the file size is probably sufficient
for most cases, since almost any code change changes the file size.
A signature which also requires a file match on the bytes being replaced
(if they are not fixed up and they are in a segment, they must be
somewhere in the file!) is very good, but might be overkill.
Since file match signatures hit the disk, they might noticeably increase
the load time of the module.

DO NOT match on the NE signature in the module header. This is
just a waste of bytes, since it always matches.
DO match on the file size unless you have a very good reason not to.
If going through the ifs, this is a very cheap test.
DO match on something, since we don't want to rely on just the
name of the module. We have signatures. Use them. If you have
no better idea (eg. there is only one version), match on the
windows version, the size(s) of the segment(s) being patched, and
the file size.


Patch data:
-----------
The patch values specify sequences of bytes to add or replace.
Add's must be placed after the end of the unpatched segment.
The segment is GlobalReAlloc'd as necessary to contain the new code.
Replace's must be within the limits of the unpatched segment,
and they must match the sequence of old bytes in the patch value.
Obviously, replaced bytes cannot contain fixups.
The contents of the value string are not used, except to be sent
to the debugger as a debugging aid when the value is loaded from
the registry. The contents of the value data must be in REG_BINARY
format.

Example:
--------
Note: The registry key show below will not work as shown, since it
has been broken into multiple lines for legibility. Join the lines
together and it works.

The Add value has data with a size of 8 bytes, saying that at offset
3f0h that the 3 bytes c2,0a,00 should be added.
    "Add"=hex:02,08,f0,03,03,c2,0a,00

The Replace value has data with a size of 0bh bytes, saying that at
offset 67h that the 3 bytes c2,0a,00 should be replaced with e9,86,03.
    "Replace"=hex:01,0b,67,00,03,c2,0a,00,e9,86,03

    new bytes-----------------------------++-++-++

The combined effect of these two changes is to replace a "retn a" at 67
with "jmp 3f0" and, at 3f0 to add "retn a". The app runs exactly as
before in this case, except for a small detour. When it reaches ip=67,
instead of doing "retn a", it does a "jmp 3f0" and then the "retn a".



Example for code segment 1 of module "INSTALL":
We want to change the message number they are checking against in a WndProc
from 181 to 402.   So here's what ya gatta do....

1. Open a patch.ini file in your favorite editor


2. Run private\tools16\gensig.exe :  gensig file.exe seg#
   where seg# is the 1-based HEX value of the segment you want to patch.  You
   will see the correct segment number to use if you do a "vdmexts!lm sel" 
   dump for the selector of interest under ntsd (it will be under the "Seg"
   heading).
      gensig install.exe 1
      ff06010242136500030600d600  <--- resulting hex string signature


3. Grab the resulting hex string & paste it in your patch.ini file with the 
   following format:  RegistryPath\ModuleName\HexSignature\SegNum

\Registry\MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppPatches\INSTALL\ff06010242136500030600d600\1


4. Now the fun part.  The patch bytes list needs to be done in groups of 4 bytes
   because it will be converted to DWORDS later.  

   The first DWORD is the 1-Byte_ByteCount with a bunch of leading zeros:
       0x0000000B  Note: this must match the 1-Byte_ByteCount in the next DWORD
                         See "^^Note:" at the end of this section on how to 
                                     calculate this.

   The second DWORD takes the following format:
      2-Byte_CodeOffset 1-Byte_ByteCount  1-Byte_PatchCode 
        where the 2-Byte_CodeOffset is the same offset you would type to
        disassemble the code under ntsd:  u seg:off
      For this example we want to alter 3 bytes at 1:305 so we need to write:
      0x03050B01 
        \__/\/\/
          \  \ \___ The 1-Byte_PatchCode (01 = "replace")
           \  \____ The 1-Byte_ByteCount (# bytes in the entire patch string)
            \______ The code offset

   Next write a 1-Byte_PatchByteCount followed by the PatchBytes.  For the 3
   bytes we are replacing in this example:
      03 2d 81 01   2d 02 04 00
      \/ \/ \___/   \/ \___/ \/                      ______
       \  \   \      \   \    \___ Zero pad the DWORD      |
        \  \   \      \   \_______ The value "402"         |
         \  \   \      \__________ "Sub" instruction code  |-- PatchBytes
          \  \   \________________ The value "181"         |
           \  \___________________ "Sub" instruction ______|
            \_____________________ 1-Byte_PatchByteCount

       Now DWORD arrange the above 4-byte clusters:
           0x01812d03 0x0004022d

   Put this all together as follows:
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d
                                       \/       \/
                                        \________\__ These two will be the same

            ^^Note: the 1-Byte_ByteCount is the count of the bytes in all of the
                    DWORDS we built except the first one (0x0000000B in this 
                    case) and doesn't count any of the padding zeros in the 
                    last DWORD.  See below:

                                 0 bytes    4 bytes    4 bytes    3 bytes
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d

                1-Byte_ByteCount = 4 + 4 + 3 = 0xB



5. Next add another registry path entry to the "ModuleCompatibility" section:
\Registry\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ModuleCompatibility

   Followed by a REG_SZ entry for the Module:
          INSTALL = REG_SZ "0x0002"
                            \____/
                               \____ use "0x0002" for WOW in general
                                     and "0x8000" for RISC WOW only


6. The resulting patch.ini file should look like this:

\Registry\MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppPatches\INSTALL\ff06010242136500030600d600\1
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d

\Registry\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ModuleCompatibility
          INSTALL = REG_SZ "0x0002"


7. Run "regini patch.ini" to update the registry

8. Install a checked krnl386 and run the app under ntsd to see any patching
   messages when the module loads.  If you have any problems set a bp at
   PatchAppSegWorker in krnl386 (source: wow16\kernel31\patch.asm) and step
   through what's going on.  Chances are you have the byte order mixed up and
   you can see how you will need to re-arrange the PatchBytes in patch.ini 
   to get what you really want.

This directory contains a special version of the kernel program for Microsoft Windows. By running this special version, called SKERNEL, you can get an accurate accounting of all calls, swaps, discards, and swap returns that occur during a Windows session. Reviewing the information provided by SKERNEL will allow you to develop the most efficient code segmentation scheme for your application.


What You Need to Run SKERNEL
----------------------------

To analyze the swapping activity for your application, you need the following:

1. A special version of the kernel, usually called SKERNEL.EXE and the corresponding symbol file, SKERNEL.SYM.

2. A utility program named SWAP.EXE that analyzes the swap information.

3. Symbol files for the modules you want information about.


How to Use Swap and SKERNEL
---------------------------

To set up Windows and your application for swapping analysis, follow the steps below.

1. Set up a "slow boot" version of Windows, and copy SKERNEL.EXE from this disk to your Windows directory.

1. In the win.ini file, set the SwapProfile variable found in the [kernel] section as follows:

0 = do nothing (acts just like a normal kernel except that thunks will be slightly larger and slower)

1 = record just swap calls, discards, and swap returns

2 = record swap calls, discards, swap returns, and all calls through thunks. Warning: This setting generates a very large amount of data.

If a value is not specified, 1 is assumed.

2. Start SKERNEL.

3. Run the application program that you want to analyze.

4. Exit from Windows.

5. Run SWAP.EXE.  


How SWAP Works
--------------

Swap reads a file named SWAPPRO.DAT that was created while the Windows session was running and combines it with the information found in the symbol files to produce the desired information. Swap then displays a tab delimited file to the screen. The output can also be redirected into a file and then read into a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.

If SWAPPRO.DAT contains a large amount of data, it will take SWAP quite a long time to look up all the module and symbol names. To limit the size of SWAPPRO.DAT (and therefore the time required to match names), you can specify the modules and segments for which SWAP should prepare output. To specify the modules and segments, type the following argument on the command line:

		[module[:segment]]

For example,

		swap gdi:_fontres 

displays only records that contain the _FONTRES segment of GDI. 

You can list multiple modules or module/segment pairs on the command line. Just separate them from each other with spaces.  For example,

		swap gdi:_fontres user

displays records that contain the _FONTRES segment of GDI or any segment of USER.

If you wish to track swap information for SKERNEL, as well as other modules, copy SKERNEL.SYM to your Windows directory, and rename it KERNEL.SYM.

If you have renamed SWAPPRO.DAT (the data collection file) or moved it to another directory since running your application, you can specify the path and filename with the -f command line argument. For example, if you have moved SWAPPRO.DAT to the \tmp directory and renamed it SWAPREC, type the following command to run the Swap program:

		swap -f \tmp\swaprec

What the Output Means
---------------------

The result of SWAP's analysis is displayed on the screen in tabular format. The columns are, from left to right:

Column			Explanation
------              -----------

Type				Tells which kind of event occurred. 
				CALL    = a normal call through a thunk.
				SWAP    = a call through a thunk that 
				          caused a swap
				DISCARD = discard of a segment
				RETURN  = return that caused a swap in 
				          of the caller

				If the segment discard was the result of 
				a swap, then the discard records will 
				occur after the swap record.

Time				The relative time that this event 
				occurred, in milliseconds, with 1/18.2
				second resolution. The first event is
				always time 0.

Segment			For CALL or SWAP, the segment being
(1st occurrence)	called. For DISCARD, the segment
				being discarded. For RETURN, the segment
				being returned to.

				If the module name appears in 
				parentheses, e.g. (USER), then the .SYM
				file for that module was not found.

Offset			For CALL or SWAP, the offset into the
(1st occurrence)	segment being called.  For RETURN, the
				offset into the segment being returned
				to. For DISCARD, this field is blank.

Segment			For CALL or SWAP, the segment that did
(2nd occurrence)	the calling.  For DISCARD and RETURN,
				this field is blank.

				If the module name appears in
				parentheses, i.e., (USER), then the .SYM
				file for that module was not found.

Offset			For CALL or SWAP, the offset into the
(2nd occurrence)    segment that did the calling. For 
				DISCARD and RETURN, this field is blank.

We never have built OLECLI.DLL for WOW.

Until NT 5, we just distributed the Win 3.1 version.

On NT 5, we distribute the Win '98 version.

The difficulty is that nobody seems to know how this gets built,
from what sources it was built, or the tools used to build it -- 
not even the Win'98 folks who built the Win'98 version (scary huh?).

So for now the Win '98 binary is just checked into the 
private\mvdm\bin86 dir with the respective FE Win '98 versions.

This document is intended to provide preliminary information on Sherlock, a system diagnostic tool.  The purpose of Sherlock is to diagnose the cause of system errors.  Currently, when an application fails, the system provides a simple dialog box:

UNRECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERROR
Terminating Current Application
OK

This doesn't supply enough information to find and fix the problem.  If a user gets too many UAE errors, they can install Sherlock in windows.  Sherlock will generate a special file on disk with information that will help technicions fix the problem.
Installing Sherlock
Make sure SHERLOCK.DLL is in your windows or windows\system directory.  Make sure SHERLOCK.EXE is in your windows or windows\system directory.
Add SHERLOCK.EXE to your LOAD= or RUN= line in WIN.INI.  Alternatively, use ProgMan or FileMan to run Sherlock.  You will see the Sherlock icon on your desktop.
Using Sherlock
When a system error occurs, such as Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE), Sherlock will write a special file in your windows\system directory.  By default, this file will have a large amount of information.  You can reduce the size of this file by instructing Sherlock to skip certain less-important information.
By default, this report is called "SHERLOCK.LOG".  You can change the name and location of this file by adding a "logfile=" entry to the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.  You can also redirect output to a serial or parallel device.  For example, to send reports to a debugging terminal, add this line:
[sherlock]
logfile=com1
Report Format
Each section of a Sherlock report can be disabled by adding it to the "skipinfo=" entry of the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.  For example, to disable the module list output of a report, add this line:
[sherlock]
skipinfo=module
Sherlock Report Header
The first section of the report indicates the Sherlock software version (0.7), time and date of event, the fault type ('Invalid Opcode'), selector:offset of the fault, and segment number and file name of the current application.

Sherlock 0.7 Failure Report - Fri Apr  5 21:39:16 1991
Elementary - a 'Invalid Opcode' fault has occured at 0df5:0416.
This is from segment 1 of 'C:\TEMP\DIBTEST.EXE' (DIBTEST)
The cause appears to be 'Invalid Opcode'.

This part of the report is mandatory, it cannot be disabled.
CPU Registers
The 16 bit CPU registers, segment registers linear base address and limit, whether the selectors are Code, Data, or NULL.  This section is important, but you can disable it by adding "skipinfo=regs" to the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.

32 Bit CPU Registers
If the CPU is a 386 or 486, the 32 bit register contents will be displayed, unless "skipinfo=32bit" is added to WIN.INI.

Disassembly
The instructions before and after the faulting instruction are disassembled.  In this case, an illegal opcode was executed in the application, and so it is disassembled as an unknown instruction.  This section can be disabled with "skipinfo=disasm".  The faulting instruction is marked with the (module name:symbol+offset) of that address.  This last feature requires the presence of a .SYM file with debugging symbols in the same directory as the associated .EXE file.

Stack Dump/Trace
The stack dump shows stack frames, letting you know the calling sequence that produced the fault.  The example shows that function GPFault was called by DoCommand, which was called by MAINWNDPROC, called by USER:DISPATCHMESSAGE, called by WINMAIN.  The CS:IP and SS:SP of the stack frame are also displayed.

Other Reports
At this point, Sherlock's GP Fault decoding logic is incomplete.  We detect many possible GP faults, but not all.  Examples we detect are null pointer usage, writing to code segments, segment limit violations, divide by zero.  Other faults may occur that display as "Unable to detect."  Let us know if that is a problem for you.
Here are some other sample fault displays.  They were generated with the WIN.INI entry  "skipinfo=info, modules, tasks, stack, 32bit".

Building user16:

If you don't have USER sources that match the build you're testing on,
and you're building x86 free, you will want to use:

nmake NONX86=1

which will build a version which does not embed copies of user32.dll

When you're building checked or on RISC, this is a non-issue.

        MS-WRITE for version 2.0 of Windows is a weird bird in that it 
cannot be compiled with standard tools (ie: MASM 5.0 etc.).  You will
need to set up a separate environment from which to make it using the 
tools in the \WRITE\TOOLS subdirectory.  We are sorry for this inconvenience
and will attempt to remedy this in future versions of MS-WINDOWS.

Sincerely,

OEM Support Group

                                                     ** 27-February-1989

I am trying to remove the above restriction.  The Win "DEV" SLM project is
being used to build MS-WRITE for Windows 3.0, currently without problems.
Make sure autoexec references are made/added as follows:
        set path=\dev;\dev\tools
        set include=\dev\inc
        set lib=\dev\lib

WRITE is the makefile for this project.  DO NOT USE MAKEFILE -- I do not
know where it came from or why it's here, and of course we may learn that
things are not currently as rosy as we believe, but this is how I *THINK*
the product has been made in the past...
        
        MAKE WRITE              MAKE "DEBUGDEF=-DDEBUG" "DFLAGS=/Zd" WRITE
        builds the standard     builds a debugging version
        release version

        
                                                     ** 28-March-1989
                                                        pault

The above procedure was not generating quite the same WRITE.EXE as we've 
previously had (Win 2.x).  In talking with anyone who's ever been involved
at all, this is the information I have learned:

   1. Nobody wants this product or claims responsibility for it.
   2. It has been a nightmare for everyone who has worked on, with,
      or around it. 
   3. The international version was incorporated at some time during
      2.x and is now "built in".
   4. There was at one time an online help system designed which was 
      never included in a shipped version.
   5. The 6 or 8 batch files, .libs, and makefiles "makefile" and 
      "wrtmake" are for the 2.x version; since we have since grown up 
      I am removing them...
   6. The K*.* files (or *.K* files) apply to the Kanji make process and
      they have N-O-T been updated yet, but are being left in the project
      (i.e. they must be modified or add to the "write" makefile).  Also
      see the file EDM.EDM (hey, file naming is our specialty here at MS).
   
I have made mods to the project and "write" makefile to incorporate the
subtle changes from 2.x.  Variations of the make process are/will be 
documented inside the makefile.

        
                                                     ** 8-June-1989
                                                        pault

In order to ease localization of this product, all string-related info
in GLOBDEFS.H should really be moved to WRITE.RC because that's where
it belongs and it'll also make things a lot cleaner.  [True for Kanji?]

                                                        
                                                     ** 31-August-1989
                                                        pault

Due to major changes in Write.rc and the split into Write.dlg, whoever
takes on the task of localization to Intl or Kanji should be sure to
start over with the new Write.rc and Write.dlg.

                                                        
                                                     ** 18-October-1989
                                                        pault

I've just made a major revision with regard to font handling in Write.
The first one was to make sure that the endmark is always displayed in
the system font.  The Kanji version already ensured this so I grouped
all the code concerning this under the define 'SYSENDMARK', and enabled
it in the Z version.

The second one was to revamp font enumeration... (under 'NEWFONTENUM')

Old method: Call EnumFonts to get a list of fonts available, and "filter 
            out" fonts which did not match our desired aspect ratio (based 
            on the overall display dimensions).  In addition, any fonts 
            which were not the ANSI character set (i.e. the tmCharSet or 
            lfCharSet fields in the TEXTMETRICS and LOGFONT structures, 
            respectively) were "swallowed".  A specific byproduct of this 
            was that screen fonts such as Modern, Script, Symbol, etc.
            could not be used in Write.

New method: Call EnumFonts to get a list of fonts available.  No filtering-
            out is done.  The major problem here became an issue with the
            Write file format: the font name and font family are stored in
            the document but naturally not the appropriate character set 
            value (since only ANSI had been previously allowed).  So now
            when we read a new document in, we enumerate all the fonts and
            then for each font in the doc we try to match up the correct
            character set value.  

            This slows things down ever-so-slightly and we also have the 
            possibility of getting confused if someone names a font of one
            character set the same as one of a different character set, but 
            there wasn't much alternative -- it was either make this kind
            of guess or revise the file format which would have created a
            lot more problems at this point.


                                                     ** 23-October-1989

FernandD has worked on the localization issue mentioned above and checked
in changes for Rel 1.46

                                                        pault

One change involved in the above NEWFONTENUM was to use FORM1.C instead 
of the (presumably) faster FORMAT.ASM.  So this sparks the idea to keep
a list of some performance ideas for future use...

done?   task
-----   ----
        1) handcode critical routines (including the use format.asm 
           instead of form1.c)
        2) make use of register vars
        3) chipa suggests breaking up really large segments, and eliminating
           very small ones
  X     4) remove inefficient lockdown of dialog procs, etc.  not sure
           why this is currently done but it forces a large amount of 
           code to be fixed at write startup, and this hampers the general
           idea of movable segments in a winapp!
        5) remove use of C run-time libs

                                                     ** 25-October-1989

It has just been decided to remove support for ExtDeviceMode from Write
(primarily because none of the other apps had it!)  This means that when
you change Printer.Setup inside Write, that affects the global Windows
printer settings (rather than just those for the current Write session).

readme for genwowit.exe

This tool generates two source files for wow32, wowit.c and wowit.h,
from the input file wow.it.  wow.it contains one pseudo-prototype
for each API we want to have an interpreted thunk for.  The program
converts these psuedo-prototypes into interpreted thunk byte streams
in wowit.c's InstrSwamp byte array, and entries in wowit.c's
IntThunkTable which point to the API and the thunk instruction stream.
The psuedo-prototypes can have two names separated by an equals sign,
indicating the 16-bit API name on the left is thunked to the 32-bit
API name on the right.

The bytecode instruction streams consist of 0 or more argument conversion
opcodes, which don't have the high bit (0x80) set, followed by a return
code conversion opcode, which does have the high bit set.

genwowit tries to keep InstrSwamp as small as possible by pointing
multiple interpreted thunks at the same instruction stream when they
share prototypes (args & retval types).  See for example below how
UpdateColors, StartPage, EndPage, and GetTextCharacterExtra all
use the first instruction stream because they all take a GDI handle
and return an int.

Further, genwowit will point into the middle of an existing instruction
stream if it contains the instruction stream it needs.  For example see
below how the wowit.c IntThunkTable GetRasterizerCaps entry points to
InstrSwamp + 0xb, which is 3 bytes into the instruction stream for
TextOut, because ignoring the first three TextOut args they have the
same prototype.

An example, here's a tiny wow.it and the wowit.h and wowit.c that result.

----- wow.it begin
INT   UpdateColors(HGDI);
INT   StartPage(HGDI);
INT   EndPage(HGDI);
DWORD GetFontData(HGDI, DWORD, DWORD, PTR, DWORD);
WORD  GetRasterizerCaps(PTR, INT);
WORD  IsGDIObject=GetObjectType(HGDI);
WORD  GetTextAlign(HGDI);
INT   GetTextCharacterExtra(HGDI);
INT   SetTextCharacterExtra(HGDI, INT);
DWORD GetTextColor(HGDI);
INT   GetTextFace(HGDI, INT, PTR);
INT   SetTextJustification(HGDI, INT, INT);
WORD  TextOut(HGDI, INT, INT, PTR, INT);
----- wow.it end

here's the output genwowit produces on the console:

Generated wowit.h and wowit.c from wow.it
13 thunks, 8 unique instruction streams, 29 instruction bytes, 5 max args.

And the files:

How to add a new thunk table for a new 16-bit thunk DLL:

 - modify wow16\kernel31\kernel.def and add an export similar to __MOD_KERNEL
   rebuild the 16-bit libraries  (nmake in mvdm\wow16\lib)

 - modify the Thunk macro in inc\wow.h and add another externA
   update the MOD_ constants in wow.h, the profiling code still uses them.
   regenerate wow.inc

 - update kernel31\kdata.asm and add another MOD_ variable

 - declare and make public a new __MOD_ value for exporting  (ldboot.asm)

 - create the table (.h file) for inclusion into wowtbl.c

 - wowtbl.h  - add a field to the tableoffsets structure

 - wowtbl.c  - #include the table into aw32WOW and update apszModNames,
    InitThunkTableOffsets, ModFromCallID, and TableOffsetFromName

 - update makefile.inc with the new dependency

readme for interpreted thunks

Interpreted Thunks are an attempt to replace the simplest thunk functions
in WOW with a bit of data.  Each thunk consists of a pointer to the Win32
API routine (actually to a callable loader thunk in one of the pages set
aside for fixups if needed) and a pointer to a variable-length byte stream
which dictates how to convert arguments and return values.  The first byte
is an opcode indicating how to thunk the leftmost argument, the last byte
is distinguished by having its high bit set (0x8?) and indicates how to
thunk the return value.

A tool called genwowit reads a source file called wow.it which contains
psuedo-prototypes (really thunk descriptions) and generates wowit.h
and wowit.c with the actualy thunk table and assiociated instruction
"swamp" containing all the bytecode instruction streams.  See
\nt\private\sdktools\genwowit\readme.txt for details.

Note that the major restriction of interpreted thunks as implemented is
that pointers to structures which need thunking are not supported.

Here's a tiny wow.it and the wowit.h and wowit.c that result.

----- wow.it begin
INT   UpdateColors(HGDI);
INT   StartPage(HGDI);
INT   EndPage(HGDI);
DWORD GetFontData(HGDI, DWORD, DWORD, PTR, DWORD);
WORD  GetRasterizerCaps(PTR, INT);
WORD  IsGDIObject=GetObjectType(HGDI);
WORD  GetTextAlign(HGDI);
INT   GetTextCharacterExtra(HGDI);
INT   SetTextCharacterExtra(HGDI, INT);
DWORD GetTextColor(HGDI);
INT   GetTextFace(HGDI, INT, PTR);
INT   SetTextJustification(HGDI, INT, INT);
WORD  TextOut(HGDI, INT, INT, PTR, INT);
----- wow.it end

here's the output genwowit produces on the console:

Generated wowit.h and wowit.c from wow.it
13 thunks, 8 unique instruction streams, 29 instruction bytes, 5 max args.

Assigned Node Type Codes

Most system structures start off with a two byte identifier.  Some components
refer to this as a NodeTypeCode.  To make development and debugging easier each
each component is assigned a range of type code values.


The following table is used to keep track of assigned type code values used
by various system components.

Locking Rules for Po interface code

1.  The Dope structure and all elements in it
    or referred to by it, including idle, notify,
    and channel structures, are protected by a
    global lock named PopDopeGlobalLock.
    use PopLockDopeGlobal and PopUnlockDopeGlobal.

    EXCEPTION:  PoSetDeviceBusy is allowed to wack
                directly on the IdleCount variable.


2.  The Irp serial list is protected by the
    PopIrpSerialLock, accessed via
    PopLockIrpSerialList and PopReleaseIrpSerialList,
    note that the later does NOT lower IRQL.
    PowerFlags (sys state, dev state, pend, active) are
    also protected by the irpserial list lock.

3.  Notify network protected by eresource named PopNotifyLock,
    dope/notify data protected by the DopeGlobalLock.

4.  Lock order:
        PopNotifyLock, DopeGlobalLock, IrpSerialLock.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\base\ntos\po\notes.txt ===
Questions:
    If we send an inrush IRP to A (which is inrush) and A sends it on
    to B, which is not (so we'll process it normally), does anything weird happen?

Driver Rules:
    1.  Must call PoCallDriver for IRP_MJ_POWER regardless
        of the minor code.

    3.  When a driver has received a power irp, and wishes to pass it
        on to other drivers, the following rules apply.

        a.  The SystemContext field must be copied into the next stack location.

        b.  if a driver passes a given irp on to multiple parallel drivers
            (for example, an FT driver that calls multiple disk drivers with
            a single request) then the driver must pass the power irp on to
            each driver one at a time.  it could pass on multiple copies in
            parallel, but if and only if they are not INRUSH.

    4.  If a single irp's stack of functions contains both Power functions and
        non-power functions, the SystemContext field must be propogated accross
        the non-power functions.

        Example:

            driver A gets MJ_PNP_POWER, MN_SET_POWER, incoming SystemContext = s0

            A calls B with MJ_IOCTL, MN..., to get B to do some side function
            associated with powering down (flushing a hardware cache, say)

            B calls C with MJ_POWER, MN_SET_POWER, ...

            Then A must pass SystemContext on to B, which must pass it on to C
            (via a call to PoCallDriver)  PoCallDriver may modify the SystemContext
            that was passed in, so that C gets a different one.

        If this is not done, when the power IRP is passed to C, PoCallDriver won't
        know it's a continuation of a previous IRP, and therefore may do the wrong
        thing.

        (For example, if A and C have INRUSH set, and B doesn't pass on the
            SystemContext value passed into A, then when B does PoCallDriver(C, irp)
            it will be enqueued forever because PoCallDriver thinks it is
            another, different, inrush irp.)

    5.  Any code that fills in a stack location with the first Power function
        of that IRP's stack must set SystemContext to 0.

@@  inrush will lead to deadlocks if two inrush DOs are ever in the same
    stack
!!> special context rules allow an irp to flow up and down a stack,
    need to be sure this is well doc'd.
    if a driver has D0_INRUSH set, and an INRUSH irp arrives, that irp
    might get held up waiting for some other irp to clear in that driver.
    (e.g. some other driver power state irp that didn't set power TO D0
          might hold up all inrush irps in the system)
    if DO is marked inrush, we will always call it at DPC level, just
    to avoid confusion over what is pageable and what is not.

    inrush applies only to device irps, or to device irps and system irps?
    if the later, then an inrush DO can only ever see one irp at time regardless
    of type!!!
!!> driver can receive a SystemPowerState irp even while INRUSH is locked.

!!> when calling any driver that does not set PAGE or INRUSH, we must call
    it from a worker thread at IRQL 0, regardless of where PoCallDriver was called.
    if it is an INPAGE device, we must call it from DPC at IRQL 2.
    not sure about INRUSH, I think it's at DPC too.

??  how will MN_POWER_SEQUENCE and MN_WAIT_WAKE fit into all this?

DOE content

    The contents of the DOE are 100% private.  There is a special
    declaration that allows the PoSetDeviceBusy() call to be a macro.
    (Actually, best if PoSetDeviceBusy() takes a system returned pointer,
     then there are no longer any fixed offsets to worry about.)

    The idea is that any value not needed by every DO is stored in a
    power control block (POB).  Any operation that might allocate this
    object must allow for failure of the allocation!!!


SPEC NOTES:
    Any operation that might allocate a POB must allow for failure to allocate.
    None of the DOE data is public.


Power irp rules.  Allowed one DevicePowerState and one SystemPowerState
irp at a time.

Context Values:
    If low order bit of the context field is 1, it is a flag.
    If 0, it is a pointer.
    If the whole thing is null, then no value.
    So:
        if (SystemContext == 0)
            no context set
        else if (SystemContext & 1)
            test for flag values
        else
            it's a pointer to some structure

    (need to change some code to match this.)

IRP Queues:
    Use a single global holding queue.  When a DO is busy, the IRP is
    enqueued on the tail of this queue.  Whenever a power IRP completes
    AND the "pending" bit is set, run the entire list looking for an
    IRP of that type for that DO, and dispatch it to the DO if we find it.

    This means that each DOE has only 2 bits to mark S and D active,
    and 2 bits to mark S and D pending.

    If we search the entire list and do not find any Irps for that DO,
    then the pending bit is cleared along with the active one.


Power IRPs, Inrush, and copying
    Globally, only one IRP is allowed to be active on any INRUSH DO in
    the system at any time.

    Active and Pending bits have different meanings for INRUSH DevObj
    than for normal devobj.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\base\ntos\wmi\sample\wmilib\readme.txt ===
This directory contains a sample PnP upper filter driver whose only 
purpose is to provide WMI data blocks. Typically driver writers will copy the 
sample code into their own driver and make any minor modifications so that the
WMI data blocks are always available when the driver is loaded. Alternatively
WmiSamp can be left as a filter driver if WMI data blocks should only be made
available when the filter driver is loaded. Drivers that link to classpnp.sys
should use a similar library that is part of classpnp.

    WMI enabling a driver with the sample code consists of doing 5 things:

1. Determining what data needs to be provided and organize it into data blocks
   that contain related data items. For example packets sent and bytes sent
   could be part of a single data block while transmit errors could be part
   of a data block that contains other error counts. Determine if the device
   needs notifications of when to enable and disable collections in the case
   of data blocks that impose a performance hit to collect.

2. Write a Managed Object Format (.mof) file that describes the data blocks. 
   In doing this the driver writer will need to run the guidgen tool to 
   create globally unique guids that are assigned to the data blocks. Guidgen
   *MUST* be run so that no two data blocks will have the same guid. Reference
   the .bmf file (.bmf files are created when mof files are compiled by the 
   mofcomp tool) in the driver's .rc file so that the .bmf file data is 
   included as a resource of the driver's .sys file. WmiLib hardcodes the 
   resource name as MofResourceName.

3. Build the GUIDREGINFO structure with the guids for the data blocks defined
   in the .mof file. If the device wants to be notified of when to start and
   stop collection of a data block the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag should be
   set for the data block in the GUIDREGINFO structure.

4. Implement the 6 WMI function callback routines and reference them in a 
   WMI_INFO structure.


    The sample code supports does not support more than one instance of a 
data block for each device, that is a single device object can only supply
one instance of a data block. Drivers that create multiple device objects
will supply multiple instances for a data block (ie, 1 data block per device
object).

    The sample code does not support dynamic instance names. Instance names 
are statically defined when device registers with WMI. The PQUERY_WMI_REGINFO
callback allows the device to specify a unique instance name for the device or
the PDO for the device. If the PDO is specified then WMI will translate it to 
the device instance name and use that as the unique instance name.

    All data blocks registered for a device will use the same instance name.
That is different data blocks for a device object cannot specify different 
instance names.

    The sample code can be extended to overcome these limitations if the need
arises, however this sample code should be sufficient for most applications.

    All WMI callback functions that pass the irp as a parameter are 
responsible to call WmiLibCompleteRequest when the request has been satisfied
so that the IRP can be completed. If the WMI callback function cannot 
complete the request immediately it can mark the irp pending and return
STATUS_PENDING, but it must call WmiLibComnpleteRequest when the request 
actually finishes.

    The sample code uses a simple linear search to determine the guid index
for any guid passed. If a driver provides a long list of guids then 
WmiLibFindGuid may need to be updated to use a better searching mechanism.

    WmiLib counts on a number of fields being present in the device extension
in order for it to process the WMI requests. See Wmilib.h for their 
description.

    Finally the sample code uses a static global variable to store the 
values for the data block. This is not quite correct since each device object
will typically have its own set of data that composes its instance of a 
data block. Really the global variable should be part of the device extension,
however I did not want to confuse the device extension with extra stuff.

Das Eigentum und alle Rechte an den BS-Komponenten verbleiben bei Microsoft. Alle nicht ausdrcklich gewhrten Rechte bleiben Microsoft vorbehalten.

Gewhrleistung.

Wenn das jeweilige BS-Produkt an Sie von Microsoft oder einer ihrer 100 %-igen Tochterfirmen lizenziert wurde, gilt die gegebenenfalls im EULA des jeweiligen BS-Produkts enthaltene Beschrnkte Garantie fr die BS-Komponenten, wenn die BS-Komponenten von Ihnen innerhalb der Laufzeit der Beschrnkten Garantie im EULA des jeweiligen BS-Produkts lizenziert wurden. Dieses ergnzende EULA verlngert jedoch nicht den Zeitraum, fr den die Beschrnkte Garantie gewhrt wird.

Wenn das jeweilige BS-Produkt an Sie von einer anderen juristischen Person als Microsoft oder einer ihrer 100 %-igen Tochterfirmen lizenziert wurde, schliet Microsoft alle Gewhrleistungen in Bezug auf die BS-Komponenten wie folgt aus:
AUSSCHLUSS DER GEWHRLEISTUNG.

Ungeachtet aller Schden, die Sie aus welchen Grnden auch immer erleiden mgen (einschlielich, aber nicht beschrnkt auf alle oben angesprochenen Schden sowie alle direkten oder allgemeinen Schden), ist die gesamte Haftung von Microsoft und deren Lieferanten unter allen Bestimmungen dieses Ergnzenden EULAs und Ihr ausschlielicher Anspruch fr alles Vorstehende beschrnkt auf den tatschlich fr die BS-Komponenten gezahlten Betrag oder US-$ 5,00, je nach dem, welcher Betrag hher ist.

This test harness helps in testing the compliance
matrix without creating the actual media.

It parses a text file which specifies the matrix
in sections. 

Each section name starts with '[' and ']'. The '#' 
character is used as string separator.

Some well known sections are [type#values], [var#values],
[suite#values] and [error#vaules] etc. These sections 
define keys which can be used in the actual testcase.
For e.g. [type#values] defines "pro=0x40" which indicates
that product type professional's internal representation
using DWORD is 0x40.

The value sections need to be at the start of the
test matrix text file. The other kind of sections 
which can be present in this test case matrix file are
called "Test Sections". These sections contain the actual
test cases.

For e.g.

[test#pro#5.0#2031#none#retail#fpp]
win3x#3.1#950#none#any=typeerr,no
win9x#9.5#950#none#any=none,yes
ntw#3.1#1057#none#any=vererr,no


indicates that the sections is for testing professional, 
version 5.0, build 2031, with not product suites and is
of type FPP retail variation. Each line in this section 
indicates the target platform for which this media needs
to be tested for upgrade. 

For e.g.

win9x#9.5#950#none#any=none,yes

Indicates that Windows 9X, version 9.5 and build number 950
with no product suites and of type any variation needs to
pass on upgrade with this professional media. 

Another e.g.

ntw#3.1#1057#none#any=vererr,no

Indicates that NT workstation version 3.1, build number 1057,
with no product suites and of type any variation, needs to
fail on upgrade with version error with the given professional
media.

MICROSOFT LICENSE AND NON-DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT FOR PRE-RELEASE CODE 

for the Microsoft Product code-named "Whistler" 

   1. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR DUAL DISTRIBUTION. 
      
   (a) Microsoft may provide the software accompanying this
   Agreement (the "Product") as a web-based download or on a
   CD-ROM.  Solely for internal testing, Microsoft grants
   Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
   nontransferable, royalty-free license to:  (i) install and
   use two (2) copies of the server software component of the
   Product on computers residing on Recipient's premises (a
   computer running the server software component of the
   Product shall be referred to as the "Server"), and (ii)
   install and use an unlimited number of copies of the client
   software components of the Product (including any profiles
   created using the Product), on client computers residing on
   Recipient's premises and connected to a Server.  The
   foregoing server software component limit is aggregate and
   applies regardless of how many copies of the Product
   Recipient obtains from Microsoft.  If Recipient is
   downloading the Product from a Microsoft web site,
   Recipient may make one (1) additional copy of the Product
   onto a CD-ROM to exercise the rights granted above.  All
   other rights are reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall
   not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise
   transfer the Product or any accompanying printed materials
   ("Documentation").  Recipient may not reverse engineer or
   decompile the Product, except to the extent that local law
   expressly prohibits the foregoing restriction.  Recipient
   may not use the Product in a live operating environment
   where it may be relied upon to perform in the same manner
   as a commercially released product or with data that has
   not been sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
   Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
   and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
   rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
   construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
   ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
   information therein, except as specifically stated herein.

   (b) YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT SHALL BE
   EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST
   INSTALL ANY PORTION OF THE PRODUCT ON
   ANY DEVICE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED
   EIGHTY (180) DAYS. THE PRODUCT IS TIME
   SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT FUNCTION UPON
   EXPIRATION OF THE 180 DAY PERIOD.
   NOTICE OF EXPIRATION WILL NOT ACTIVELY
   BE GIVEN, SO YOU NEED TO PLAN FOR THE
   EXPIRATION DATE AND MAKE A COPY OF AND
   REMOVE YOUR IMPORTANT DATA BEFORE
   EXPIRATION. If you desire to use the Product after your
   evaluation is completed, you will need to acquire a validly
   licensed copy of the non-evaluation version of the Product.

   (c) At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
   reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not limited
   to usability, bug reports and test results, with respect to
   the Product testing.  In addition, if requested by
   Microsoft, Recipient will use reasonable efforts to review
   and comment on all documentation supplied.  All bug
   reports, test results and other feedback made by Recipient
   shall be the property of Microsoft and may be used by
   Microsoft for any purpose it sees fit.  Due to the nature
   of the development work, Microsoft is not certain if errors
   or discrepancies in the Product may be corrected.

   (d) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
   Recipient's site.  Recipient may not demonstrate or show
   the Product to third parties without the express written
   permission of Microsoft.


   (e) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
   accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
   Services, or application-sharing functionality may require
   additional licenses - please consult the license agreement
   accompanying such software.


   2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall
      commence upon Recipient's copying, installing or
      using the Product and shall continue unless
      terminated by Microsoft in writing at any time, with
      or without cause.  This Agreement will terminate
      without notice upon the commercial release of the
      Product.  Upon the termination of this Agreement,
      Recipient shall cease use of the Product and, shall,
      upon request, promptly return to Microsoft, or
      certify destruction of, all full or partial copies of
      the Product and related materials provided by
      Microsoft.

   3. SUPPORT.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide technical
      or other support for the Product.  However, limited
      technical support ("Support Services"), if noted in
      the materials provided to Recipient by Microsoft, may
      be available.  Use of any such Support Services is
      governed by the Microsoft policies and programs
      described in "online" documentation, and/or in other
      Microsoft-provided materials.  Any supplemental
      software code provided to Recipient as part of the
      Support Services shall be considered part of the
      Product and subject to the terms and conditions of
      this Agreement.  With respect to technical
      information Recipient provides to Microsoft as part
      of the Support Services, Microsoft may use such
      information for its business purposes, including for
      product support and development.  Microsoft will not
      utilize such technical information in a form that
      personally identifies Recipient.  Such limited
      Support Services may not be available in all
      countries outside the United States and will be
      discontinued once the Product is commercially
      released.

   4. MAINTENANCE.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide
      maintenance, technical support, or updates to
      Recipient for Product licensed under this Agreement. 
      In no event shall Microsoft be obligated to provide
      Recipient, free of charge, a copy of the commercial
      release version of the Product in connection with
      Recipient's participation in the testing program. 
      Microsoft is not obligated to make the Product
      commercially available.

   5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  To the
      maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft
      and its suppliers provide to Recipient the Product
      and Support Services AS IS
      AND WITH ALL FAULTS; and
      Microsoft and its suppliers hereby disclaim with
      respect to the Product and Support Services all
      warranties and conditions, whether express, implied
      or statutory, including, but not limited to, any (if

      THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF
      USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT
      AND ANY SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS
      WITH RECIPIENT.

      AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO
      THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
      APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
      MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE
      LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,

retain title and all ownership rights to the Product, and
this Agreement shall not be construed in any manner as
transferring any rights of ownership or license to the
Product or to the features or information therein, except as
specifically stated herein.

	(b)  At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not limited
to usability, bug reports and test results, with respect to
the Product testing. In addition, if requested by Microsoft,
Recipient will use reasonable efforts to review and comment

technology (as permitted in Section 1(a) above), with all 
Microsoft application products for multi-party conferences. 
For non-Microsoft applications, Recipient should consult the

support ("Support Services"), if noted in the materials
provided to Recipient by Microsoft, may be available. Use of
any such Support Services is governed by the Microsoft
policies and programs described in "online" documentation,
and/or in other Microsoft-provided materials. Any
supplemental software code provided to Recipient as part of
the Support Services shall be considered part of the Product
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
With respect to technical information Recipient provides to
Microsoft as part of the Support Services, Microsoft may use
such information for its business purposes, including for
product support and development. Microsoft will not utilize
such technical information in a form that personally
identifies Recipient. Such limited Support Services may not
be available in all countries outside the United States and
will be discontinued once the Product is commercially
released.

4.	MAINTENANCE. Microsoft is not obligated to provide
maintenance, technical support, or updates to Recipient for
Product licensed under this Agreement. In no event shall
Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient, free of charge,
a copy of the commercial release version of the Product in
connection with Recipient's participation in the testing
program. Microsoft is not obligated to make the Product
commercially available.

5.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. To the maximum extent 
permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and its suppliers 
provide the Product and any (if any) Support Services AS 
IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, and hereby disclaim all warranties 
and conditions, either express, implied or statutory, 
including, but notlimited to, any (if any) implied warranties 
or conditions of merchantability, of fitness for a particular 
purpose, of lack of viruses, of accuracy or completeness of 
responses, of results, and of lack of negligence or lack of 
workmanlike effort, all with regard to the Product, and the 
provision of or failure to provide Support Services. ALSO,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF TITLE,
QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION,
CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE PRODUCT.

ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE
PRODUCT AND SUPPORT SERVICES, IF ANY, REMAINS
WITH YOU. 

6.	EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND 
CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES. To the maximum extent permitted 
by applicable law, in no event shall Microsoft or its 
suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect,
or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not 
limited to, damages for loss of profits or confidential 
or other information, for business interruption, for 
personal injury, for loss of privacy, for failure to 
meet any duty including of good faith or of reasonable 
care, for negligence, and for any other pecuniary or 
other loss whatsoever) arising out of or in any way 
related to the use of or inability to use the Product, 
the provision of or failure to provide Support Services, 
or otherwise under or in connection with any provision 
of Agreement, even in the event of the fault, tort 
(including negligence), strict liability, breach of contract
or breach of warranty of Microsoft or any supplier, and even
if Microsoft or any supplier has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. 

7.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. 
Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur for 
any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, 
all damages referenced above and all direct or general 
damages), the entire liability of Microsoft and any of 
its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and 
your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall 
be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid 
by you for the Product or U.S.$5.00. The foregoing 
limitations, exclusions and disclaimers shall apply 
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.

8.	GOVERNING LAW; ATTORNEYS' FEES. This 
Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the 
laws of the State of Washington and Recipient consents 
to the jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts 
sitting in King County, Washington, unless no federal 
subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case 
Recipient consents to the jurisdiction and venue in the 
Superior Court of King County, Washington. Recipient 
waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction 
and forum nonconveniens. Process may be served on either 
party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court 
rule. If either Microsoft or Recipient employs attorneys 
to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees.

will not export or re-export the Product or Documentation to
