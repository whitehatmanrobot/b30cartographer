The Xbox is a video game console that allows users to play games on television sets.  The Xbox closely resembles a desktop computer in its main specifications: it is powered by an Intel Pentium III 733 MHz processor and an NVIDIA 233 MHz Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).  The Xbox has 64MB of RAM, 1024kb of ROM (firmware), an internal 8 GB hard drive, a 5x DVD-ROM drive with movie playback, 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port, broadband compatibility and HDTV support. The Xbox will be generally available for purchase by the public through retail outlets independent of Microsoft, and will be sold in large volume without restriction through mail order, electronic and telephone sales.  Microsoft will distribute the Xbox its mass-market retail channel distribution system, including thousands of resellers and distributors.  This product will be available to customers from many third-party resellers via various combinations of retail presence, web, phone or mail order.  The recommended retail price of an Xbox is $299. Despite its many functions   video games, DVD and music CDROM playback, Internet connectivity to gaming servers and websites - the Xbox is not a general purpose computer that can host arbitrary applications; it is designed primarily for online and local gaming. Game titles are distributed on Xbox Game Media in a special DVD format or downloaded via the Xbox online service. In this version, the Xbox makes use of encryption mainly for authenticating and securing communication between two or more Xbox consoles on a local area network using IPSEC. Another use of cryptography concerns methods specially designed to protect software and content against copying or illicit use. These copy protection schemes are not disclosed in the technical part as per provision 8 of Decree no. 99-200 of March 17, 1999. The Xbox encryption and decryption functions are not directly accessible to the user and cannot being re-purposed to allow general purpose encryption or decryption capabilities. rence de l ment du moyen s il a   soumis au minist re charg  des t communications ..........................................................................

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation [Note: This quickstart is taken from an email I (pnewson) sent 7/16/2004   depending on the current date, your mileage may vary] Title[Note: This quickstart is taken from an email I (pnewson) sent 7/16/2004   depending on the current date, your mileage may vary] Paul Newson Normal.dot Paul Newson Microsoft Office WordOj}`_J CB~jMx d-sp_J >_gxYmbjbjqPqP [Note: This quickstart is taken from an email I (pnewson) sent 7/16/2004   depending on the current date, your mileage may vary] Now that a few brave souls have used the new Config class, we have a pretty good idea of the steps required to convert your component from private ini files to the new common Config class. For C# Components: Step 1) Remove the namespace xonline.server.mgmt.mc.oldconfig from your cs files if present Step 2) Add the namespace xonline.common.config to any cs file that will call the Config class Step 3) Add XLUSE_CONFIG and XLUSE_DIAGNOSTICS to your component's sources file Step 4) Find all the places in your code where you lookup topology information (i.e. IP addresses, ports, database names, etc.) Scenario A) Your component wants to communicate with a front door through a load balanced vip. Your component needs to ask the Config class for a virtual interface like this: IVirtualInterfaceInfo vInterfaceInfo = Config.GetVirtualInterface(VirtualInterface.xarb_int, Config.SiteId); Use the properties of IVirtualInterfaceInfo to retrieve the IP address, port number, vdir, and timeout values you should be using to talk to that virtual interface for the site that you are currently in. If there is a piece of information that you think should be part of IVirtualInterfaceInfo that is not there today, come talk to me. For example, Peter requested the addition of Timeout, which is a fine addition. Scenario B) If your component wants to talk to a singleton non-virtual interface. By "singleton non-virtual interface" we mean a non-virtual interface (i.e. not a load balanced VIP) where there will only ever be one instance of that interface in the service. NPDB is a perfect example.  Your component needs to ask the Config class for an interface like this: IInterfaceInfo interfaceInfo = Config.GetSingleInterface(Interface.npdb); Use the properties of IInterfaceInfo to retrieve the information you need to communicate to that interface. In this case, you would use interfaceInfo.IPAddress, interfaceInfo.DBName, and interfaceInfo.Timeout to construct a sql connection string to connect to npdb. Scenario C) Your component needs to talk to a particular instance of a non-virtual interface. This scenario occurs when we partition load across servers in a stateful way. For example, the query service (which Peter has already converted) supported several query databases. Each query dataset is assigned to a particular query database. The front door code must figure out which query database its needs to talk to given a particular dataset. Stateful services are partitioned into buckets, and buckets are then assigned to servers. A bucket can be defined by a natural partition in the structure of your data. For example, with the query service, the combination of titleid + datasetid defines a bucket. Or a bucket can be defined via a hash of some value. For example, presence defines a bucket based on a hash of the user PUID. You need to understand how the service you're trying to communicate with is partitioned before you look up an interface on the correct server. If your buckets are defined using the hash of some value, then you can translate that value into a bucket like this: uint bucket = InterfaceBuckets.GetBucketNum(Interface.xpserver, puid); If your buckets are defined directly, then you can skip the GetBucketNum step. Once you have the bucket figured out, to get an IInterfaceInfo object for the server you need to talk to, use one of the following calls: BucketServer bucketServer = InterfaceBuckets.GetBucketServer(Interface.querydb, bucket); BucketServer bucketServer = InterfaceBuckets.GetTitleBucketServer(Interface.querydb, titleid, bucket); Use the 1st call if your bucket definition does not include titleid. Use the 2nd call if your bucket definition includes titleid. The BucketServer object contains information related to stateful server migration. The details of stateful server migration is beyond the scope of this mail. However, to get the interface information for the current active stateful server, use the CurrentServer property of BucketServer, which provides you with the IInterfaceInfo object for the current server. Scenario D) Your component needs to talk to a webstore application. Because webstore application span multiple database servers, they are also represented as a virtual interface. You ask the Config class for the virtual interface info just like in Scenario A: IVirtualInterfaceInfo vInterfaceInfo = Config.GetVirtualInterface(VirtualInterface.uodb, Config.SiteId); Use the IVirtualInterfaceInfo.WebstoreApp property to retrieve the webstore application name, and pass it to the webstore client libraries. Additional notes on the Interface, VirtualInterface, and Component enums: The Config and BucketServer classes use Enums to identify the allowed values for interfaces, virtual interfaces and components, because the complete set of allowable values is at build time. These enums are defined in CommonConfigEnum.cs. I have taken a first stab at defining these for most of the components, but part of converting your component should be fixing up these enum values for your component. The semantics of these enums are: A Component represents an executable file or a database. To create the initial list, I went through and built each project in the tree, and noted what dll and exe files were binplaced. For databases, I used what I believed to be the database name. Feel free to fixup any mistakes I've made for your component. An Interface represents a network location where a component exposes a service to other components. I created one Interface for each component, with the same name as the component, as a placeholder. In many cases, a Component will expose more than one interface. For example, many front doors have an "external" interface that is called by Xboxes via the SG, and an "internal" interface that is called by other front doors, tools, etc. This is TWO interfaces, not two instances of the same interface. So for the xqry component, the Interface enums might be xqry_ext and xqry_int. You should fix up these interface definitions for your components. A VirtualInterface represents a load balanced VIP or a webstore application. Each Interface that can be exposed via a load balanced VIP should have a corresponding VirtualInterface defined. So, for example, the xqry component which exposes the xqry_int and xqry_ext Interfaces that can be load balanced, and therefore should also define the xqry_int and xqry_ext VirtualInterfaces. However, NPDB cannot be accessed through a VIP, and therefore has no corresponding VirtualInterface defined in the enum. Make sure the VirtualInterface enum values for your components are correct. UODB on the other hand, is a webstore application, and therefore has a VirtualInterface enum value defined for it. I've noted in comments within each enum what build directory each value derives from. Please try to keep these comments consistent. The enum organized alphabetically by build directory. Step 5) Find all the places in your code where you load non-topology information from ini files, and replace them with a call like this: string enableTitleLog = GetSetting(Setting.query_enableTitleLog); Note that as with Interfaces, VirtualInterface, and Components, the settings your component queries for is known at build time. Therefore we represent it with an enum and not a string. This enum is also defined in CommonConfigEnum.cs. As part of converting your component you will need to add settings to this file. The naming convention for a setting is "componentname_settingname". You can see examples in the file for components that have already been converted. Note that setting names are global. In some cases, there will be settings that are read and honored by multiple components. If you believe that one of your settings should be treated this way, you have two choices. You can either call it "global_settingname" to indicate that it is global. Or, if you are reading the setting from shared code, you can use a prefix that is appropriate given the nature of the shared code, for example "config_settingname" might be a setting used by the config class itself, which will be honored by any component using the Config class. 6) Add information to private\ops\sitecfg\xblbox\CommonConfig.xml, and unit test your changes. This file is our budding single box configuration (thanks to Peter). It uses "localhost" for servernames and "127.0.0.1" for IP addresses. If your unit tests are designed to run on your dev workstation, then adding information to this file and copying it to the same directory as your component executable should allow you to unit test your changes. The format of this file is pretty self explanatory, so I won't go into detail. If you have questions about it, let me know. Step 7) Add information to private\ops\sitecfg\bvtnet\CommonConfig.xml.  This is the CommonConfig.xml file for bvtnet. Figure out where your stuff runs on BVT net and add the appropriate information. If you don't then you'll break bvtnet the next time it gets rebuilt after your changes. For C++ Components: C++ components use the same C# Config class as C# components, but C++ components need to access it via a COM interop layer. To use the COM interop layer: Step 1) add XLUSE_CONFIG to your sources file.  This adds $(INETROOT)\private\common\configdll\$(O) to your INCLUDES path, which is where CommonConfig.tlb is found. Step 2) add the following lines to your C++ code: #import "CommonConfig.tlb" raw_interfaces_only, no_smart_pointers using namespace CommonConfig; This generates a header at build time (look in objd\i386) that contains the declarations you need to call the Config C# class as if it were a COM object. It also translates the C# enums into C++ enums. For this to work, you must have built the private\common\config directory to generate CommonConfig.tlb, which has probably already happened if you've done a full build recently. See \private\common\test\configtlb for a working example of how to instantiate and call methods using COM interop. (Thanks to Dan for getting this working!) Step 3) Make sure CommonConfig.dll is in the same directory as your C++ executable that calls Config methods. Step 4) Invoke "regasm.exe CommonConfig.dll" to add COM interop info to the registry. Note that Dan checked in a setup change to many of the C++ components already to install CommonConfig.dll in their directory and regasm it. But you may have to do steps 3 and 4 manually for your unit testing. Where we go from here... I am working on replacing CommonConfig.xml with tables in NPDB. As part of this work, I'll translate anything that's been added to the CommonConfig.xml files into sql population scripts for NPDB. I'll send more details on how to work with the NPDB version of Config when the time comes. The client interface should change very little, but instead of editing xml files to specify setting and configuration, you will need to edit sql population scripts. Thanks all, Paul.

This document describes this common configuration store, as it will exist in the Xenon M1 timeframe, in enough detail to allow a test plan to be written. Post-M1 work is also described, but in less detail. M 0.5 Design The common configuration functionality will be developed iteratively. The design discussed in this section will be implemented first, as an interim step before the complete M1 implementation, to allow other on the Xbox Live team to convert their services over to using the new common configuration classes as early in the dev cycle as possible, which will hopefully bring problems, issues and suggestions to our attention early and allow as many services as possible to convert to using the new class. Architecture For M 0.5, a Config class will be provided for C# and a COM wrapper around the C# class will be provided for C++ client applications.  The Config class will read configuration data from a file named CommonConfig.xml in the current directory. One copy of CommonConfig.xml will be checked into private\ops\sitecfg\<environment> per Xenon environment. This xml file will then be included in each Xenon MSI and deployed by the MSI with each component. This will result one copy of CommonConfig.xml for each service component, but they should all be the same unless they have been modified by hand after setup runs. C# front doors restart their AppDomain if any file in their application is changed, therefore changing CommonConfig.xml will restart the AppDomain and any changed setting will be reflected in the new AppDomain. Non-C# front doors, and other services will need to implement an xmgmt command to trigger a reload of their configuration info. Many services already have a command that is suitable for this purpose. The Config class will implement a cache flush method that can be called by the service to cause it to discard all it s cached information, ensuring that any new settings will be reloaded from CommonConfig.xml IConfig C# Interface The Config C# class will implement the IConfig C# interface defined below: namespace common.config // Note: all methods are static, no explicit initialization is required by the component // to get configuration information. The current environment name, siteid, server name, // and component name are detected automatically by the class. The current // component name is set to the current assembly name for C# components. Non-C# // components or C# components that need or want to specify a different component name // (e.g. shared code) may use one of the GetSetting overrides. public interface IConfig // Gets a list of server names that are exposing a particular interface name public static string[] GetServerListByInterface(string interfaceName);     // retrieves the information required to reach an interface on a particular server     // The value returned for  protocol  determines which of the     // other out parameters contain valid information     public static void GetInterface(         string server,          string interface,         out string protocol,         out IPAddress ipAddress,         out int port,         out string vdir,         out string dbname,         out string sharename,         out string otherInfo1,         out string otherInfo2);     // retrieves the information required to reach a virtual interface.      // The value returned for  protocol  determines which of the     // other out parameters contain valid information     public static void GetVirtualInterface(         string virtualInterface,         int siteId,         out string protocol,         out IPAddress ipAddress,         out int port,         out string vdir,         out string otherInfo1,         out string otherInfo2);     // use this API to retrieve the value for a setting for the      // current component on the current server     public static string GetSetting(string setting);     // this API provides a way to explicitly specify the component name     public static string GetSetting(         string setting,          string component);     // this API provides a way to explicitly specify the environment, server, and component     public static string GetSetting(         string setting,          string component,          string server,          string environment);     // this API is provided to make porting a bit easier. The database does not     // have a concept of section, but instead composes a setting name      // such as SECTION.SETTING, which is the value queried from the database     public static string GetSetting(         string section,          string setting);     // the following methods are intended for use by Setup and not services     public static string[] GetInstallUnitsByServer(string server);     public static void GetIntallUnit(         string installUnit,         out string installUnitInfo1,         out string installUnitInfo2,         out string installUnitInfo3,         out string installUnitInfo4);     public static string[] GetComponentsByServer(string server);     public static void GetComponent(         string component,         out string componentInfo1,         out string componentInfo2,         out string componentInfo3,         out string componentInfo4);     public static string[] GetInterfaceListByServer(string server);     // This method discards all cached configuration information, // forcing it to be reread from the source public static void DiscardCachedValues(); [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]  public class Config : IConfig     // class implementation here... } // end namespace IConfig COM Wrapper Config.cs will be built into a standalone assembly called config.dll. tlbexp.exe will be run on this assembly during the build process to generate a type library that can be referenced by C++ clients using a statement similar to the following: #import "<path>\config.tlb" raw_interfaces_only By using the raw_interfaces_only option, the C++ client does not need to import the entire mscorlib.tlb type library. The config.dll assembly will not be strongly named, and therefore must be used by C++ clients as a private assembly. This means that each service that uses the Config COM wrapper will need to install config.dll in the same directory as the client executable. Additionally, the setup for the C++ client must call  regasm config.dll  to add the required COM entries to the registry so COM clients can find and use the COM wrapper for IConfig. As shown above, the [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)] attribute will be used on the Config class. Therefore only the IConfig interface is exported by tlbexp.exe. CommonConfig.xml Example Shown below is an example of a CommonConfig.xml file. It represents a de-normalized version of the proposed NPDB configuration schema (see \public\doc\npdb\npdb\npdb.vsd). For development purposes, we should be able to use one copy of this file per environment. Some features of the NPDB implementation of the Config class are not supported in this xml file. Specifically, the ability to specify setting overrides on a per site, per server, and per component basis is not supported. Settings are global. If an override is required, then the copy of CommonConfig.xml being used by the component requiring the override should be modified manually. <Environment name= testnet <Site siteid=   <Server name= xonteiis001     <InstallUnit name= frontdoor.msi  installUnitInfo1= info1  installUnitInfo2= Info2       <Component name= xstats.dll  componentInfo1= installutil.exe         <Interface name= statsfd  protocol= x.x.x.x  port= 10000  vdir= xstats         <Interface name= statsfd-internal  protocol= x.x.x.x  port= 10001  vdir= xstats       </Component>       <Component name= xmatch.dll  componentInfo1= installutil.exe         <Interface name= matchfd  protocol= x.x.x.x  port= 10002  vdir= xmatch         <Interface name= matchfd-internal  protocol= x.x.x.x  port= 10003  vdir= xmatch       </Component>     </InstallUnit>     <InstallUnit name= xmgmt.msi  installUnitInfo1= info1       <Component name= xmgmtsrv.exe  componentInfo1= domain\username  componentInfo2= password         <Interface name= xmgmtc-admin  protocol= x.x.x.x  port=         <Interface name= xmgmtc-trace  protocol= x.x.x.x  port=       </Component>     </InstallUnit>   </Server>   <Server name= xontesql001     <InstallUnit name= npdb.msi  installUnitInfo1= info1       <Component name=  componentInfo1= npdb_populate.sql         <Interface name=  protocol= sqlserver y.y.y.y  dbname=       </Component>       <Component name= webdb  componentInfo1= webdb_populate.sql         <Interface name= webdb  protocol= sqlserver y.y.y.y  dbname= webdb       </Component>     </InstallUnit>   </Server>   <Server name= xontesql001     <InstallUnit name= npdb.msi  installUnitInfo1= info1       <Component name=  componentInfo1= npdb_populate.sql         <Interface name=  protocol= sqlserver y.y.y.y  dbname=       </Component>       <Component name= webdb  componentInfo1= webdb_populate.sql         <Interface name= webdb  protocol= sqlserver y.y.y.y  dbname= webdb       </Component>     </InstallUnit>   </Server>   <VirtualInterface name= statsfd y.y.y.y  port= 10000  vdir= xstats   <VirtualInterface name= matchfd y.y.y.y  port= 10002  vdir= xmatch </Site id= <Settings>   <Setting name= VERIFY_AUTH  value= </Settings> </Environment> Given the XML example above, the table below shows concrete examples of the xpath expressions that will be used by the Config class to implement the methods described in section 2.2.

Additionally, the Config class implementation will be enhanced to provide the following functionality: The Config class will retrieve information from NPDB the first time is requested. Subsequent requests for the same information will be filled using an in-process in-memory cache of that information. Clients of the Config class can register to be notified before config changes are committed to the in process cache, so they can veto changes they are not capable of dealing with dynamically Clients of the Config class can register to be notified after config changes are committed to the in process cache, in the case where they can adapt to a change in setting, but need to do perform some extra work. Documentation for the NPDB schema related to configuration information can be found at private\doc\sql\npdb\npdb\npdb.vsd. A t_config_changes table will be present that notes the last datetime at which any changes were made to any configuration tables. This timestamp is used by clients to efficiently detect if they need to query for updated configuration information. The timestamps in the t_config_changes table will be maintained via triggers on each configuration table. The use of triggers ensures that even if SQL Analyzer is the method by which a configuration setting is changed, the t_config_changes table will be updated. Since configuration updates are relatively rare, it is not expected that trigger performance will become an issue. C# Config Interface Shown below is the updated definition of the IConfig interface reflecting the enhancements described in section 3.1 namespace common.config // Note: all methods are static, no explicit initialization is required by the component // to get configuration information.

[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]  public class ConfigEventArgs : EventArgs, IConfigEventArgs     // class implementation here... } // end namespace Expected Use of M1 IConfig Interface If no event handlers are registered, then the client service must be prepared to use a different value each time it queries for a setting or interface, and it should not save this information beyond the context of a single transaction or operation. This is the preferred method for using configuration information, since the service will adapt to new configuration information in NPDB with no further operator intervention. For example, stateless front doors could query for required settings and interfaces on each XRL transaction, and only store the information returned for the length of that XRL transaction. Unfortunately, the reality of building software that performs well demands that certain types of information structures be constructed during initialization, and then simply referenced in each transaction. If configuration information changes, those persistent structures may become out of date, and therefore may need to be reconstructed. For this purpose, the IConfig interface provides the Changed event. If a client of the IConfig interface uses a piece of configuration data to construct a persistent structure, then it should add an event handler to the Changed event, so it will be notified of configuration changes. The event handler will be provided with information regarding what configuration information has changed, and can determine if any persistent structures need to be updated or reinitialized and can take the appropriate application specific actions. Even more unfortunately, in certain situations, the software may be completely unable to adapt to certain configuration changes, and must be completely reinitialized in a user-impacting way. For those cases, the IConfig interface provides the Changing event. This event is signaled before a configuration change is committed to the in process configuration cache. If any event handler registered to this event sets the veto member of the IConfigEventArgs interface passed to the event to true, then the configuration change is not committed to the in process configuration cache, and any requests for that configuration information will return the old, stale value. However, if the configuration change is vetoed in this fashion, an NT event will be logged to inform the operations team that a server requires maintenance. The NT event will be logged each time the stale setting is requested, but not more often than once every 60 seconds, to avoid spamming the event log. Note: The current C# Config class is xonline.server.mgmt.mc.Config. This new one is common.config.Config. Putting the new class in a new namespace means that both can coexist during the transition period. I will live in common, because it will be shared between tools and server code. The current Config class supports the following features: Rotating settings Changing settings using xmgmt GetSettingWithDefault These features will not be supported in the new Config class for the following reasons: Rotating settings are no longer required because of the move to NIC teaming. Servers no longer need to know about multiple IP addresses to reach a single interface. According to ErnieC, barring some large surprise, NIC teaming will be used on all servers in Xenon, shielding server code from the complexity of multiple NICs. You will no longer be able to query for supported settings and change them on the fly using xmgmt. ConfigDB provides an authoritative list of supported settings by component, and provides the ability to specify an override for a setting by environment type, environment, site, and server, so I believe this xmgmt feature is no longer required. Defaults should be specified in configdb, not in C# source code, so this feature will be removed. Steve Lamb wrote some C# code that allows you to specify attributes on a class which automatically loads their values from ini files. I don t plan to replicate this functionality, but I have a suspicion that Steve will port this over to the new Config class when he ports his service, so if you re interested, talk to Steve :). M1 Config Class Sequence Diagram The sequence diagram below depicts the interaction between server code consuming a setting, the Config class, and NPDB. The sequence diagram for interfaces and virtual interfaces would look the same, except that instead of looking up a simple named value pair, the Config class is asks for interface details or virtual interfaces from NPDB.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Impact on Setup Setup will interact with these tables as follows. Step 1) create NPDB schema and stored procs Step 2) populate config tables in NPDB using SQL scripts (see section 3.3) Step 3) the rest of setup is then data driven based on the information that was populated into NPDB For more details on how setup uses the data in these tables, see MichioN s setup dev spec (currently at private\doc\common\xenon-m1-setup.doc) Populating Config Tables in NPDB The population scripts will be divided as follows: npdb_config_base_info.sql   populates relatively static domain tables: t_protocols, t_ip_roles, t_environment_types, t_server_states, t_domain, t_install_units npdb_config_component_info.sql   populates t_components, t_interfaces, t_virtual_interfaces, t_environment_type_protocol_details. This is the scripts that a component developer uses to describe the structure of their component.  npdb_config_server_type_info.sql   populates t_server_types, t_server_type_interfaces. This defines the different types of servers that can be built out. A component developer will modify this to add their interfaces to applicable server types. npdb_config_settings.sql   populates t_settings, t_environment_type_settings. This is where the developer will specify the default values for settings their component consumes, and any required environment type override values. The four scripts above completely populate the environment invariant portion of the database. Then we will have one script per environment that populates the environment specific portion of the database, i.e. t_environments, t_servers, t_sites, t_server_ips, t_environment_virtual_interface_ips, t_environment_virtual_interface_details, t_environment_protocol_details, t_server_protocol_details, t_environment_setting_overrides, for example, the one for testnet might be called npdb_config_testnet.sql. Note that setup can run all of these scripts during setup, because any information that is not relevant to the current environment will simply not be used. Post M1 Features / Work Items Add xmgmt between Config and NPDB, where it can periodically poll and proactively notify services of any configuration changes, as well as cache a local copy of the server s configuration in an xml file on disk. Provide tool support for modifying settings in running environments. Add a column to interface definitions that is  extra setup info  that is consumed only by setup and not when querying for  where do I find interface X . (protocol_implementation_details?) Examples You are a developer assigned the project of creating a new front door service, called XFD. You have decided that XFD will be implemented in xfd.dll, and will be installed as part of the consolidated front door MSI. Therefore, you update npdb_config_component_info.sql to add one row to t_components for your new component: vc_component_name vc_install_unit_name vc_component_install_details consolidated front door installutil You have also decided that XFD will provide three interfaces. All will be http based, and will be exposed via the /xfd vsite. The external interface that will be used by xboxes (via an SG) will usually be provided on port 10082, will be exposed on the middle tier IP address of whatever server it is on, and can be fronted by a VIP. The second interface is an internal interface intended for use by other front doors. It will usually be exposed on port 10083, and can also be fronted by a VIP. The third interface is intended for use by admin tools only, will usually be exposed on port 10084, and cannot be fronted by a VIP. Therefore you update npdb_config_component_info.sql to add the following three rows to t_interfaces corresponding with your three new interfaces: vc_interface_name vc_component_name vc_ip_role vc_protocol vc_protocol_details xfd-ext mid tier 10082/xfd xfd-int mid tier 10083/xfd xfd-admin mid tier 10084/xfd Also in npdb_config_component_info.sql two rows will be added to t_virtual_interfaces that correspond with the two interfaces that can be fronted by a VIP. vc_virtual_interface_name vc_interface_name vc_virtual_interface_details xfd-ext xfd-ext 10082/xfd xfd-int xfd-int 10083/xfd Then, you need to consider what server types your interfaces will be exposed on. Looking at the list of defined server types, and what other interfaces they expose, you determine that server types  stateless front door two-box A , and  compact net B  should expose your interfaces. You therefore edit npdb_config_server_type_info.sql to add your interfaces to those three server types. This is three interfaces on three server types, for nine rows total: vc_interface_name vc_server_type_name xfd-ext stateless_front_door xfd-ext two_box_A xfd-ext compact_net_B xfd-int stateless_front_door xfd-int two_box_A xfd-int compact_net_B xfd-admin stateless_front_door xfd-admin two_box_A xfd-admin compact_net_B While implementing your component you find several places where it would be useful to customize the behavior of your front door via a setting. Some of these are common functionality that other components already consumer, like VERIFY_AUTH, and others are unique to your component. In the case of VERIFY_AUTH, you need do nothing in npdb, since there is already an entry in t_settings that defines VERIFY_AUTH and provides a default of TRUE. Additionally, there is an entry in t_environment_type_settings that overrides the default VERIFY_AUTH setting of TRUE and sets it to FALSE for development type environments. But you also need a new setting called DO_EXTRA_XFD_DEBUG_STUFF. It should default to FALSE, so you add the following to t_settings via npdb_config_settings.sql: vc_setting_name vc_value DO_EXTRA_XFD_DEBUG_STUFF FALSE However, you want to enable this behavior by default in development environments, so you also add a row to t_environment_type_settings via npdb_config_settings.sql as follows: vc_environment_type_name vc_setting_name vc_value development DO_EXTRA_XFD_DEBUG_STUFF Note that if test or ops wants to flip this setting for a particular environment, a particular site, or a particular server, they can do so via the t_environment_setting_overrides table. They can also turn VERIFY_AUTH on and off for the whole environment, or just for XFD via the same table. For example, to enable DO_EXTRA_XFD_DEBUG_STUFF for just your component on one server in production to try and troubleshoot a problem, ops could add the following row to t_environment_setting_overrides: vc_environment_name vc_component_name i_site_id vc_server_name vc_setting_name vc_value production tukpriis001 DO_EXTRA_XFD_DEBUG_STUFF If test wants to run testnet in a secure mode, they could add the following row to override VERIFY_AUTH for all components on all servers in testnet: vc_environment_name vc_component_name i_site_id vc_server_name vc_setting_name vc_value testnet VERIFY_AUTH TODO: Add example on how to populate the server information for an environment.

Operations should use this document as a starting point to create a more detailed document. In general, all these keys should not need to be migrated unless we suspect there has been a compromise. Ops could also adopt the policy of changing the easier to change keys on a regular basis just to be paranoid. In any case, these key migration procedures should be tested before we go live.  You should be able to run (lightweight) stress testing during these key migrations without the clients receiving any errors or noticing any problems. The key changes described in section 2, 3, and 4 are easier and could be changed on a regular basis if we wanted to. The key changes described in section 5, 6, and 7 are much harder and scarier and should be avoided if possible.  Changing the PASSPORT.NET Key This section describes how to change the PASSPORT.NET krbtgt Key; this key is used to encrypt TGT s during chained AS requests. The following description describes how to change the key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V, and that the master key version in use is MKV. xkeymgr addfreq 1 V+1 MasterKey.pub , which will create a random new  type 1  PASSPORT.NET key with version V+1. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload . This will make all the AS KDCs know what the V+1 key is.  Modify all the askdc.ini files on the KDC INH boxes to contain V+1 as the key version to use for the PASSPORT.NET key (i.e. the type 1 key). (See bug 20529) Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc SetPassportKeyVersion V+1 . This will make all the AS KDCs start issuing TGTs encrypted with the V+1 key. xkeymgr removefreq 1 V krbtgt PASSPORT.NET MKV . This will remove the  type 1  PASSPORT.NET key with version V. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload . This will make all the AS KDCs forget about the version V key and no longer accept it. Changing the XBOX.COM Key This section describes how to change the XBOX.COM krbtgt Key; this key is used to encrypt TGT s to be read by the XKDC during TGS requests. The following description describes how to change the key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V, and that the master key version in use is MKV. xkeymgr addfreq 2 V+1 MasterKey.pub , which will create a random new  type 2  XBOX.COM key with version V+1. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :xkdc reload . This will make all the XKDCs know what the V+1 key is.  Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload . This will make all the AS KDCs know what the V+1 key is, and start issuing new TGTs with this new key. Wait 30 days. xkeymgr removefreq 2 V krbtgt XBOX.COM MKV . This will remove the  type 2  XBOX.COM key with version V. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload . This will make all the AS KDCs forget about the version V key and no longer use it. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :xkdc reload . This will make all the XKDCs forget about the version V key and no longer accept it. Note: If we are rolling the XBOX.COM key because it is compromised, we need to skip step 4. Therefore we should test it without step 4 to make sure it works. The tricky thing is to make sure that the XKDC will return the Kerberos error KDC_ERR_TGT_REVOKED when it receives an incoming TGT that is encrypted using a key version that is no longer supported. Changing the SG Site Keys This section describes how to change the pre-shared key between the XKDC and the SGs. The following description describes how to change the key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V, and that the master key version in use is MKV. It also assumes we are changing the key for site  . If more than one site key needs to be changed, then this procedure will need to be performed on all such sites. The SG is assumed to be installed on drive D. xkeymgr addfreq 6 V+1 MasterKey.pub  c sg_S_V+1.ini , which will create a random new  type 6  SG key with version V+1, and output the corresponding sg_S_V+1.ini file for use on the SG. Copy the file sg_S_V+1.ini to all SGs of site S and open a cmd window on each machine. In these cmd windows, run  xkeymgr protect sg_S_V+1.ini D:\sgcfg\sg_S_V+1_protect.cfg  to generate the protected files. Then you can delete the sg_S_V+1.ini files. Make the SG accept the new key in sg_S_V+1_protect.cfg by running the management command  e :sg configure_file_secure D:\sgcfg\sg_S_V+1_protect.cfg Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :xkdc reload . This will make all the XKDCs know what the V+1 key is, and start issuing tickets using the new key version. Double check to make sure all logons that are issued fresh new tickets are logging on correctly. Wait 36 hours. xkeymgr removefreq 6 V sg siteS MKV . This will remove the  type 6  SG key with version V for site S. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :xkdc reload . This will also make them completely forget about the version V key. Run the following management command on all the SGs to make them stop accepting the version V key: e :sg configure_string  ExpireKeys {SiteId S BelowVersion V+1} Note: If we are rolling the SG keys because it is compromised, we need to skip step 6. Therefore we should test it without step 6 to make sure it works. What should then happen is that all the users that use a cache ticket will get no reply from the SG Key Exchange, and the client logic should then go back to the XKDC to get a fresh ticket and retry. The second time, this should all work since the new ticket should be encrypted with key V+1. Changing the Key Encryption Key This section describes how to change the Key Encryption Key. The following description describes how to change the key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V, and that the master key version in use is MKV. xkeymgr addfreq 5 V+1 MasterKey.pub , which will create a random new  type 5  key encryption key with version V+1. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload . This will make all the ASKDCs know what the V+1 key is.  xkeymgr migratekek V V+1 MKV SomeXONWatchUser , which will convert the one user with the GamerTag  SomeXONWatchUser  to have its keys encrypted with the new V+1 KEK. Verify that the one migrated user can logon (without using cached tickets). Modify the KeyEncryptionKeyVersion ini file parameter for XMACS and UACS to be V+1. The UACS servers should pick up the new ini files via ASP.NET magic. The XMACS servers will need to be restarted or forced to use the new KeyEncryptionKeyVersion using a management command.  To do this use the SetKEKVersion command in xmgmtc then call the reload command to make XMACS load the new key encryption key. xkeymgr migratekek V V+1 MKV , which will convert all the users to have its keys encrypted with the new V+1 KEK. This could take a long time depending on how many users we have. Verify that everything works. xkeymgr removefreq 5 V  . This will remove the  type 5  key encryption key with version V. To the extent that is possible, destroy any UODB tape backups that contain the version V KEK. Changing the Master Key This section describes how to change the Master Key. The following description describes how to change the master key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V. xkeymgr createmk V+1 MasterKey.pub MasterKey.prv , which will create a random new master key pair. Copy the new .pvk and .pub files onto a floppy and remove the files from the original machine used in step 1. xkeymgr storemk MasterKey.prv  on all the machines that need it. This includes XMACSINH, XKDCINH, UACSIIS, XCUST and XBOSIIS. xkeymgr migratemk V MasterKey.pub  to copy all the rows in the t_service_keys table into new rows encrypted with the V+1 master key.  (this must be run from a server which has the V1 MasterKey installed on it) Touch the uacs.ini and xbos.ini files to force the UACSIIS, and XBOSIIS servers to reload the new keys.  Use xmgmtc on all the XKDCINH boxes and run  e :askdc reload  and  e :xkdc reload  to make it reload the keys again using the new master key.  Use xmgmtc on all the XMACINH boxes and run  e :xmacs reload  to make it reload the keys again using the new master key.  Verify that everything works. Remove all entries in t_service_keys table encrypted with the old master key (version V) using either a SQL statement or using  XKEYMGR REMOVEFREQ  for all key types. Remove the old master key (version V) from all machines using  xkeymgr REMOVEMK V Backup the new .prv and .pub files on a CD-R and lock it (and the floppy) in a safe. Destroy all the previous floppies and CD-Rs that contain the version V master key. Changing the Master Signature Key This section describes how to change the master signature key; this key is used to sign data within the signature server. The following description describes how to change the key from version V to version V+1. It assumes that the system is currently already working correctly with key version V, and that the master key version in use is MKV. xkeymgr addfreq 7 V+1 MasterKey.pub  d1 signatureKey  d2 signatureKey  , which will create a random new  type 7  master signature key with version V+1. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the signature server boxes and run  e :xsig reload . This will make all the signature servers know what the V+1 key is.  Modify all the xsig.ini files on the signature server boxes to contain V+1 as the key version to use for all new signatures. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the signature server boxes and run  e :xsig setSignWithKeyVersion V+1 . This will make all the signature servers start signing data with the V+1 key. Wait 3 month (or however long we are willing to accept data signed with the old key). xkeymgr removefreq 7 V signatureKey signatureKey MKV . This will remove the  type 7  master signing key with version V. Use xmgmtc sequentially on all the signature server boxes and run  e :xsig reload . This will make all the signature servers forget about the version V key and no longer accept it. Changing the nCipher Key This particular procedure is very complicated and probably doesn t warrant testing until the need actually arises (i.e. an nCipher device or operator card is stolen). What to do when what gets compromised This section describes the what keys need to be changed when certain keys are suspected to be compromised. When an SG site key is compromised This could happen if the floppy/CD-R containing the site key is compromised, or if a hacker was able to poke around on an SG machine. Only the steps describes in section 4 need to be performed for the site of concern. When the PASSPORT.NET key is compromised This should rarely happen. Only the steps described in section 2 need to be performed. When the XBOX.COM key is compromised This should rarely happen. Only the steps described in section 3 need to be performed. When UODB is compromised This could happen when a UODB tape backup disappears or if we have reason to believe a hacker has had access to UODB for some time. In such a case, we unfortunately need to change almost all keys. The steps to follow are: Change the master key (section 6). Change the key encryption key (section 5). Change the remaining keys (section 2, 3, and 4) in any order. When the Master Key is compromised This could happen if we know that a hacker has been playing around on a machine that has the master key. In such a case, we unfortunately need to change almost all keys. The steps to follow are: Change the master key (section 6). Change the key encryption key (section 5). Change the remaining keys (section 2, 3, and 4) in any order. Microsoft Confidential Key Migration Specification Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES  gdBPD gdBPD gdBPD gdD*7 gdFpZ gdD*7

The service uses two different types of accounts:  user accounts and machine accounts.  The machine account is used to authenticate an Xbox console to the network before any services can be accessed.  Machine account creation and provisioning covers the entire process to create and secure this machine account from the time of manufacturing until user first sign in.  This document describes the entire machine account creation and provisioning process. The key point to understand in Xbox machine account creation is that we leverage manufacturing to generate a unique  secret  that is shared by each individual Xbox and the service.  This secret is used to bootstrap secure communication and the process of authenticating an Xbox.  The threat of compromising our machine account creation process is that computers can masquerade as Xbox machines. This document covers the machine account creation process that begin with the generation of keys at manufacturing to the completion of the process by accepting the machine long-term key for the Passport machine account.  The Design Section will describe the protocols used to securely communicate information to our service; the manufacturing genealogy database and the Machine Account Provisioning Database; the Machine Account Provisioning Key Distribution Center (MAP KDC); and the threat model of a compromise or attack on our machine account creation process. The Xbox Network Security specification (  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Specs"  http://sts/xbox_online/Specs ) describes the network security protocols that an Xbox uses after the initial machine account creation. Architecture Diagram Figure 3.1: Machine Account Creation process  HYPERLINK  \l "_Xbox_DNS_Resolution"  DNS Lookup  HYPERLINK  \l "_Xbox_Initial_Kerberos"  Xbox Initial Kerberos AS Request  HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_Account_Provisioning_3"  Machine Account Provisioning Database Lookup  HYPERLINK  \l "_Passport_Machine_Account_1"  Passport Machine Account Creation  HYPERLINK  \l "_MAP_KDC_Reply"  Passport Machine Account Long-term password returned in Kerberos AS Reply Design The design of the machine account creation system is to securely create a Passport account for each Xbox when it comes online and to put the machine account strong password onto the Xbox.  This strong password is used to authenticate the Xbox upon future connections to our service. This section describes the design of: the Online Key generated during manufacturing and how it is used to establish trust; the database schema that contains the machine credentials; the network protocols used to authenticate Xbox consoles for the purpose of providing secure online services for the Xbox; Passport machine account creation; and the Machine Account Provisioning Servers.  Manufacturing Processes and Keys Before the service can create an Xbox Machine Account, it must have some way to trust that the entity on the other end is really an Xbox and not a PC (or some other easily programmable computing device) masquerading as an Xbox.  If a PC were able to masquerade as an Xbox and create an Xbox Machine Account, then the PC can continue to create user accounts and participate in Xbox online subscription services.  Participation in the service includes creating users, downloading content and playing games.  To solve the problem of PC s masquerading as Xbox consoles, we leverage the manufacturing process to create a secret that both sides can share for each Xbox produced.  Spoofing and masquerading attempts are thwarted by creating a random Online Key during manufacturing that is only known to both the Xbox and online service. Each production line has a system integration test computer that runs thorough diagnostic information on each Xbox before it is sent to the more general system level test.  The system integration test computer also generates unique, machine-specific data and several random keys.  These keys are used to protect various different parts of the Xbox gaming system to insure that malicious users cannot subvert their Xbox consoles. This section describes what these keys are for, how they are generated, what needs to be recorded and how some of the recorded data gets secured during transit.   The system test computer sends the machine-specific data to the Xbox and records relevant information into a   HYPERLINK  \l "_Manufacturing_Genealogy_Database"  manufacturing genealogy database Online Key The system integration test computer generates a random, machine-specific Online Key that will be used as a shared secret between the Xbox and online service. The Online Key is 16 bytes long. The system integration test computer sends machine-specific data to test software running on the Xbox that writes the data to the EEPROM.  The system integration test computer also encrypts the Online Key and writes the machine-specific data to the manufacturing genealogy database.  Periodically, the manufacturing genealogy database is transferred to our data center where the appropriate fields are moved to our Machine Account Provisioning Database.  The Machine Account Provisioning KDC will extract the Online Key (and machine-specific serial number) from the Machine Account Provisioning Database to authenticate that this is an Xbox during machine account creation. The system integration test computer encrypts the Online Key before it is recorded into the manufacturing genealogy database because unlike the hard drive key and the recovery key, the Online Key is much more sensitive and needs to be strongly protected from being compromised. The reason the Online Key is sensitive is because a malicious user can use the machine credentials and Online Key to create an Xbox Machine Account on their PC.  The hard drive key and recovery key are only useful to a particular Xbox and do not have to be protected in our manufacturing process as strongly. We will encrypt each online key with a public key at the factory before we store the data into the manufacturing genealogy database. The Xbox online team possesses the corresponding private key and it is held within (nCipher brand) secure hardware devices.  These nCipher devices decrypt the Online Key during online account provisioning.  Only the Xbox online team will be able to decrypt the Online Keys.  The Online key is only briefly exposed in memory during creation at the factory and in memory upon a machine account provisioning request.   The Xbox online team uses 1024 bit RSA public key encryption to protect these online keys.  The encrypted Online Key will be 128 bytes.  As an added precaution against compromise of the private key, we want to be able to change the public/private key pair used to encrypt the Online Key.  The system integration test computer will also send a  Key Version  field to the manufacturing genealogy database. Key Version  field is currently  If the private key is compromised, the online team will generate a new public/private key pair and increment the  Key Version  field.  Since the current Online Keys in the Machine Account Provisioning Database (MAP DB) were encrypted with the old private key, they must be decrypted and then re-encrypted with the new public key.  This process is documented more thoroughly in the section   HYPERLINK  \l "_Compromise_of_the"  Compromise of the Online Key Management System Hard drive key We want to lock the contents of each Xbox hard drive so that malicious users cannot read the contents of the hard drive on a PC.  However, we do not want the key to lock the hard drive to be the same for all Xbox consoles because one person who broke their key can advertise how to unlock other hard drives.  In order to solve this problem we generate a random hard drive key for each Xbox manufactured.  The hard drive key is 16 bytes long. The hard drive key will be written into the EEPROM on the Xbox motherboard at manufacturing time. The ROM loader will use the key to unlock the hard drive during each Xbox initialization.  The key will also need to be recorded into the genealogy database at manufacturing time because repair facilities need it to unlock the hard drive of an Xbox with a motherboard problem. Recovery Key If an end user gets their Xbox hard drive into an inconsistent state, the user will need to recover the hard drive back to a state that will allow the Xbox to function again.  The Xbox will clear the user and game data from the hard drive.  There is some information that persists between recovery and is not covered in this document.  We do not want any user to arbitrarily recover their hard drive since they might not be aware of the consequences.  The solution is to have a random button press sequence generated for each Xbox that our call center will tell the user when they wish to perform a hard drive recovery operation.  The user will be told recovery sequence for their particular box by calling our support center and after being educated on the consequences of this operation.  The button sequence is recorded in the manufacturing genealogy database so that Call Center Support staff can access it. MarcW: Is the recovery documented? The Recovery Key will be recorded in the genealogy database using 8 bytes of data. Each byte will be an ASCII character having one of the following 9 values: : The A button should be pressed. : The X button should be pressed. : The Y button should be pressed. : The up button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The down button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The left button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The right button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The zero byte represents that no more characters are in the sequence. Note:   is intentionally omitted because it is  The zero bytes will only be present at the end of the 8 byte string. The current plan is to only require 4 button presses, thus the trailing 4 bytes will always be  . The button press sequence is derived from the hard drive key using an algorithm, thus making it unnecessary to record this button press sequence into the EEPROM. Generating, Writing and Verifying machine-specific data An Xbox goes through the system integration test phase after it has been completely assembled.  A system integration test computer communicates through the Ethernet port with both the newly assembled Xbox and with a central genealogy database located in the factory.  The system integration test computer collects and generates the unique data per machine and sends this data to the Xbox and genealogy database to be recorded.  Software running on the Xbox writes this data into the Xbox EEPROM along with various checksums.  The system level test computer will verify these checksums during a later test phase. The Xbox software team will deliver to the System Level Test Software Development team three software routines that correctly generate, write and verify the machine-specific data. Contact for the System Level Test Software Development team is Brad Inman of Intel.  The development of System Level Test Software will transition to the Xbox team sometime after launch. The System Level Test Software Development team will incorporate these routines into the system integration test and extended test phases of the manufacturing process.  GeneratePerBoxData The Xbox software team will create a Win32 library (GenPerBoxData.lib) that contains a single function called GeneratePerBoxData. The system integration test computer uses this function to generate the binary array containing the machine-specific data.  HRESULT GeneratePerBoxData (     IN DWORD GameRegion,     IN DWORD AVRegion,     IN LPBYTE pbMACAddress, // 6 bytes     IN LPCHAR pcXboxSerialNumber, // 12 bytes     OUT LPBYTE pbHardDriveKey // 25 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPCHAR pcRecoveryKey // 8 bytes     OUT DWORD* pdwOnlineKeyVersion     OUT LPBYTE pbOnlineKey // 173 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPBYTE pbOutputBuffer,     IN OUT DWORD* pdwOutputBufferSize,     ); The game region, TV region, the 6 byte Ethernet MAC address, and the Xbox serial number is passed into the routine and the routine will generate an array of data that is sent to the Xbox and passed into the function WritePerBoxData to be written on the EEPROM.  The system integration test computer sends the hard drive key, recovery key, online key version and online key to the genealogy database. The online key encryption process is here: Xbox-Machine-Specific-Data-Spec.doc WritePerBoxData The Xbox software team will create an Xbox library (WritePerBoxData.lib) that contains two functions called WritePerBoxData and VerifyPerBoxData. The Xbox uses the WritePerBoxData function to write the binary array containing the machine-specific data to EEPROM. HRESULT WritePerBoxData (     IN LPBYTE pbInputBuffer,     IN DWORD dwInputBufferSize     ); This routine takes the buffer of data generated by GeneratePerBoxData, formats the information, computes checksums and writes the result into the EEPROM. VerifyPerBoxData The Xbox calls the VerifyPerBoxData function in the Xbox library (WritePerBoxData.lib) as the last function during manufacturing to read the data on the EEPROM and verify that the checksums are valid, lock the hard drive and to clear the manufacturing region code that allows system test software. HRESULT VerifyPerBoxData (); Manufacturing Genealogy Database The Manufacturing Genealogy Database is maintained by the hardware operations (HOPS) team and contains information required for manufacturing.  It is periodically sent to the Xbox online data center and the Xbox online team pulls out a few required fields for the online machine account creation process.  Here are the fields (and their lengths) that are recorded into the genealogy database during manufacturing but are needed by the Xbox online team: Length Description SerialNum Unique primary key.  12 digit serial. No dashes. MaterialNum Microsoft Part number. (SKU) OnlineKeyVer Version of encryption (only meaningful to us) OnlineKey 128 byte PK.  Base64 encoded to 172 bytes Manufacturing Genealogy Database Contact: Arch Holder  HYPERLINK  \l "_Manufacturing_and_Hardware"  HOPS team  will have to provide this information for each added or modified genealogy database record. And this for each deleted genealogy database record: SerialNum JPotter: what format do you want these in?  What is the current process to get them to our data center and what do we do with them? DamonD: The process and formats should go here and get reflected in the External Dependencies section. These fields are inserted into the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_Account_Provisioning"  Machine Account Provisioning database  from the manufacturing genealogy database: Length Description SerialNum Unique primary key.  12 digit serial. No dashes. MaterialNum Microsoft Part number. (SKU) OnlineKeyVer Version of encryption (only meaningful to us) OnlineKey 128 byte PK.  Base64 encoded to 172 bytes Machine Account Authentication and Sign Up Process Once the machine credentials (including the Online Key) have been moved into the Machine Account Provisioning database, the process to authenticate and create an Xbox machine account (also called  Sign Up ) can take place.  The process and protocols described here follow the chronological steps required for machine account creation. Threat Model and Security Any malformed packets or non-compliance to the protocol may mean the attempted spoofing by a PC and results in the blocking of the machine account by setting the  Block Account  value in the MAP DB to true.  The account may be unblocked after investigation.  In the beginning, the process for investigation of security violations will be on a case-by-case basis by the product team.  Future processes may be created and documented once patterns emerge. DNS Resolution to the Machine Account Provisioning KDC Upon initial online sign up, the Xbox will use an asynchronous resolution method to resolve the address to the Machine Account Provisioning KDC (MAP KDC): machine.xbox.com will be hard-coded in the XTL code that the title links with.  The asynchronous model is described in   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/API Spec - Online Work Pump.doc"  http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/API Spec - Online Work Pump.doc Initial Kerberos AS Request Once the domain name to the MAP KDC is resolved, the Xbox initiates the authentication process through the Kerberos protocol [RFC 1510].  The shared Online Key that was generated during manufacturing is only used in this process to establish trust between the entities.  The Xbox starts the Kerberos AS request cycle to the MAP KDC.  First the Xbox sends a Kerberos AS request (KRB_AS_REQ) to the MAP KDC.  The principal is the Xbox serial number that was generated at manufacturing and stored on EEPROM.  The realm is  account.creation.xbox.com The preauthorization field contains the PA_ENC_TIME (encoded time) encrypted with the shared Online Key.  If the time is out of tolerance (or not set), a standard Kerberos exchange happens to set the offset to the clock. Machine Account Provisioning Database Lookup The MAP KDC must first validate the received packet is in the right format and that the keyed hash of the serial number is valid.  The MAP KDC will   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  alert the data center when receiving invalid packets .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated. The MAP KDC will then lookup the pre-shared key for that particular Xbox in the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_Account_Provisioning_1"  Machine Account Provisioning Database  (MAP DB) through a special extension to the KDC that allows  stand-alone  authentication. The contact for the KDC is John Brezak. The MAP KDC will query the following fields through a SQL command to separate server containing the MAP DB: SerialNum MaterialNum OnlineKey AccountBlocked AccountCreated CreationAttempts If the record does not exist, the data center will be alerted that   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  invalid credentials are being sent .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The alert will be sent using the general alerting, monitoring and logging mechanism put in place by the Ops team. The first check is if this account has been blocked by checking the  AccountBlocked  field.  If set, this machine account has been blocked.  The data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated. CreationAttempts  field is incremented and written back to the MAP DB. The second check is if this account has been blocked due to a possible attack by checking the  CreationAttempts  field.  If this over 20, a possible DDoS replay attack of credentials is being mounted or a spoofing attempt by a PC is being performed.  The data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The  AccountBlocked  field for this serial number should be set in both the MAP DB and the KDC DB described in the Network Security Specification. The third check is if this account has already been acknowledged as set up by checking the  AccountCreated  field.  If this is set, a possible DDoS replay attack of credentials is being mounted and the data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The  AccountBlocked  field for this serial number should be set in both the MAP DB and the KDC DB described in the Network Security Specification. The Online Key is encrypted by the public key at manufacturing and base64 encoded so the MAP KDC must base64 decode, then decrypt the Online Key using an nCipher box that will be installed on the MAP KDC.  If the information is formatted correctly but the decryption fails, then MAP KDC will alert the data center when   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  receiving invalid packets .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The  Account Blocked  field for this serial number should not be set as this might be a random set of information generated by an attacker. Passport Machine Account Creation After the MAP KDC verifies the information passed in the preauthorization field of the Kerberos AS request sent from the Xbox, the MAP KDC will create a machine account on the Passport KDC using the delegated administrator functions through the MAPS interface provided by the Passport team.   The contact for the MAPS interface is ??????.  VanVan: What contact should we use here? Passport uses email addresses as the account name so a special machine account name is created for each Xbox. xnnnnnnnnnnnn@machine.xbox.com Were nnnnnnnnnnnn is the unique 12 digit Xbox serial number.   The long-term password for the machine account is never seen (or entered) by users and will be randomly generated to guarantee a strong password that is not susceptible to dictionary attacks. A random 128-bit string is used as the long-term Passport machine account password. If the  PassportCreated  field is set in the MAP DB, then the new password will be set for the current serial number.  Otherwise, the account is created and the  PassportCreated  field is updated. All Xbox machine accounts are Passport accounts and will have a unique 64 bit Passport ID associated with them. The Passport ID is return by Passport for each new account created.  We cache the Passport ID and serial number on the Xbox upon sign in. Upon failure, the UAP server will return an error code to the Xbox and alert our data center that   HYPERLINK  \l "_Passport_Machine_Account"  Passport cannot create a user account The MAPS interface documentation is located at:   HYPERLINK "http://maps"  http://maps Van Van and TonyChen: If you find the right document (I hunted around a little bit), please tell me and I ll put it in.  I didn t see delegated admin functions in the 5.0 or 5.1 specs.   Van Van: who can Tony talk to over there for getting the right developer information? MAP KDC Reply Once the Passport account is created successfully, the MAP KDC sends back a Kerberos AS reply.  In the Kerberos AS reply, the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) the long-term password that was generated for the Passport machine account will be the session key. The Xbox first validates that the reply is properly formatted and encrypted with the proper Online Key.  If these checks fail that the Xbox gives the  Online service is busy.  Try again later  message. The Xbox does not use the TGT in the Kerberos AS reply but stores the Passport ID and session key contained in the encrypted part of the response onto the hard drive and it will be used subsequently as the machine credentials sent to authenticate to the Passport KDC.   The Passport machine account long-term password is stored on the Xbox hard drive so that is can be persisted over shutdowns and reboots.  Since it is considered harder to figure out the hard drive key of an Xbox than it is to crack open its hard drive and read the contents, will we encrypt all passwords and keys we store on the hard drive with the hard drive key.  This makes the difficulty level of obtaining information from an Xbox that you have physical access to about the same as figuring out the hard drive key of the Xbox. The Xbox will store machine keys and user keys in the configuration sector of the hard drive, because the configuration sector will survive a hard drive reformat and recovery. This makes Xbox accounts persist over most hard drive recoveries. Sign In At this point, the Passport machine account has been created and the credentials have been stored onto the hard drive.  Subsequent sign in attempts go directly to the Passport KDC to get the TGT [see Figure 3.1: Step 4] and are covered under the network security specification. Encryption Scheme used in Kerberos We use  RC4-HMAC  encryption in the Kerberos request and reply.  All encrypted data is prefixed with a 16 byte checksum and an 8 byte confounder.  The encryption process generates random bytes for the confounder then combines the confounder with the raw data and computes a keyed HMAC checksum.  The checksum is then used to compute a new key.  The new key is used to encrypt the confounder and the raw data.  The decryption process first computes the decryption key based on the checksum and then decrypts the confounder and the raw data.  Then it performs the same computation to derive the checksum and verifies that the checksum matches. Since the real key that is used during encryption and decryption is only 16 bytes long (the size of the MD5 hash output) we use 16 byte keys for all of our encryption.  Using larger size keys will not increase our cipher strength and only increase our headaches during export approval. Machine Account Provisioning Database The Machine Account Provisioning Database (MAP DB) contains these fields: Length Description SerialNum Unique primary key.  12 digit serial. No dashes. MaterialNum Microsoft Part number. (SKU) OnlineKeyVer Version of encryption (only meaningful to us) OnlineKey 128 byte PK.  Base64 encoded to 172 bytes PassportCreated Set upon Passport machine account creation AccountAck Set upon successful first sign in by the Xbox KDC AccountBlocked Machine account creation has been blocked CreationAttempts Incremented to block DDoS against Passport The first four fields are pulled from the manufacturing genealogy database and the  AccountAcknowledged  and  AccountBlocked  are null upon row creation.  The  CreationAttempts  field is set to zero.  When the Xbox successfully signs in for the first time, the KDC DB will set the  AccountAcknowledged  value to true.  The KDC DB is documented in the Network Security Specification.  This is to prevent denial of service attacks against us by continuously replaying machine credentials and taking up Passport resources to verify if the machine account has already been created.  The  Account Blocked  value is automatically set when a potential attack is being preformed on a serial number with the valid Online Key. Machine Account Provisioning KDC The Machine Account Provisioning KDC (MAP KDC) is the first Xbox server that an Xbox will talk to.  The MAP KDC runs a special  Stand-Alone  version of the Microsoft KDC that does not rely upon Active Directory to authenticate requests coming in from clients.   Kerberos The communication protocol with the MAP KDC will be Kerberos on port 88. MAPS object The latest MAPS object (  HYPERLINK "http://maps"  http://maps ) is installed on the MAP KDC.  This object communicates with the Passport authority to create accounts. Authentication Plug In The stand-alone KDC will allow authentication plug-in DLLs to be installed that will do our own authentication using the Online Key and provide Passport machine account information in the encrypted portion of the ticket.   More details on the implementation will be forthcoming. nCipher Devices There will be an nCipher device installed in each MAP KDC machine.  The nCipher device decrypts the Online Key that is stored in the Machine Account Provisioning Database (MAP DB).  The MAP KDC should issue and alert if the   HYPERLINK  \l "_nCypher_device_not"  nCipher device is not responding Clock Synchronization Skew The MAP KDC and Xbox client-side code will enforce time checks for the initial Kerberos AS cycle to create a machine account.  The Xbox sends the local time and zone to the KDC.  If the time is off by more than 5 minutes, the KDC returns the server time.  The Xbox adjusts and sends the new request.   If the user has not set their time zone in the dash, the default one (GMT) will be sent. Security This section covers potential security issues and how these will be addressed.  Xbox uses an augmented threat model that we call K-STRIDE which is based on the STRIDE put together by the Secure Windows Initiative team.  The STRIDE model has been augmented with several network-specific topics that I wanted to discuss separately from the general STRIDE groupings.  For more information on security, see the SWI team web site at   HYPERLINK "http://swiweb"  http://swiweb This section discusses the known vulnerabilities of the Xbox Machine Account Creation process, server and protocol. For each vulnerability we know about, we describe the importance of the vulnerability, the possible known attacks that could be deployed, and if the vulnerability could be caused by a title, we discuss what certification requirements we should have on all released titles to make sure that the vulnerability is minimized. Key Management and Exchange The only thing worse than cryptographically weak keys is exchanging strong keys with an adversary.  The secure management and exchange of keys is a fundamental requirement.  Online Key The system integration test computer generates a unique, machine-specific Online Key that will be used as a shared secret between the Xbox and online service.   Importance The compromise of the Online Key would let a hacker create a valid Xbox machine account on their PC. Attack During manufacturing, the system integration test computer creates, encrypts and stores the Online Key into the manufacturing genealogy database.  Periodically, the manufacturing genealogy database is transferred to our data center where the appropriate fields are moved to our Machine Account Provisioning Database.  The Machine Account Provisioning KDC will extract the encrypted Online Key and decrypt it using a secure nCipher hardware device.  The Online Key is only held temporarily in memory and is never sent or persisted in the clear. Compromise of the Online Key Management System In case of: A compromise of the private key used to encrypt the Online Key; The disappearance of an operator smart card used to start an nCipher device; The disappearance of an administrator smart card used to initialize nCipher devices, create operator and administrator smart cards; or The disappearance of an nCipher device  These steps must be considered: Machine Account Provisioning Servers and Databases taken offline The valid and invalid machine ID ranges must be determined A new nCipher device must be procured and initialized to match the scalability requirements (with a minimum of 2 active devices online in case of failover) with 2 more backups owned by dev and test, respectively A new security world must be set up for the nCipher devices 6 administrator smart cards must be created; At least 2 administrator smart cards must be used to do any operation 4 Operator cards must be created A new public/private key pair must be generated The new public key is sent to manufacturing and used for encryption of the manufacturing "Online Key" All current Online Keys in the MAP DB need to be decrypted and re-encrypted with the new public key.  The  Key Version  field needs to be updated. All genealogy database updated with the old version of the public key must be decrypted and re-encrypted with the new public key before insertion into the MAP DB.  The  Key Version  field needs to be updated. 2 operator smart cards are sent to operations 1 operator smart card is put into the Redmond ITG secure operations center 1 operator smart card is put into the Dublin secure operations center 4 administrator smart cards are put into the Redmond ITG secure operations center 2 administrator smart cards are put into the Dublin secure operations center All currently encrypted keys decrypted with the old private key and re-encrypted with the new public key The Online Key Version field in the MAP DB is updated with the new version Machine Account Provisioning Servers and Databases reinstated Spoofing Identity Machine account creation attempted without valid credentials The connection will be dropped on the server without sending any information back to the Xbox.  Valid users will timeout and be directed to our call center by the Xbox.  The timeout is determined by development based on standard network protocol durations and retries.  An alert will be signaled:   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  Alert: Machine account creation attempted without valid Online Key The credentials passed to create a machine account were not valid.  This has these possible causes in order of likelihood: A hacker has attempted to spoof information. The valid machine information created at a refurbishing facility has not been populated into our machine account provisioning database. The valid machine information created at the factory has not been populated into our machine account provisioning database. An invalid Xbox has been created by a compromise of the manufacturing security. PC Spoofing Attempt A hacker is attempting to send bogus credentials to either gain authentication or to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Denial_of_Service_from Account Crea"  deny service to the Machine Account Creation Servers  by taking up resources to validate the bogus credentials.  This is similar to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted "  replaying credentials from a valid Xbox Valid machine information created by a refurbishment center but not entered into our database A valid, but refurbished Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate credentials created by the refurbishment center has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Valid machine information created by the factory but not entered into our database A valid Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate credentials created by the factory has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Invalid Xbox Manufacturing security of the Xbox creation process has broken down and the rogue Xbox is attempting to create a machine account.  This should be a very rare scenario.  Since the user will have to subscribe to the service, however, they will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials The connection will be dropped on the server without sending any information back to the Xbox.  Valid users will timeout and be directed to our call center by the Xbox.  An alert will be signaled:   HYPERLINK  \l "_AID_00000002:_Machine_account creat"  Alert: Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials The credentials passed to create a machine account were valid but for an existing account.  This has these possible causes in order of likelihood: A hacker has attempted to replay information. The valid machine information created at a refurbishing facility has been duplicated across separate consoles. The valid machine information created at the factory has been duplicated across separate consoles. An invalid Xbox has been created by a compromise of the manufacturing security. PC Spoofing Attempt A hacker is attempting to replay credentials to either gain authentication or to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Denial_of_Service_from Account Crea"  deny service to the Machine Account Creation Servers  by taking up resources to validate the credentials.  This is similar to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _2"  sending bogus credentials Valid machine information created by a refurbishment center and entered into our database twice A valid, but refurbished Xbox is attempting machine account creation but it is in our database already.   The process to populate unique credentials created by the refurbishment center has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Valid machine information created by the factory and entered into our database twice A valid Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate unique credentials created by the factory has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Invalid Xbox Manufacturing security of the Xbox creation process has broken down and the rogue Xbox is attempting to create a machine account.  This should be a very rare scenario.  Since the user will have to subscribe to the service, however, they will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD PC Masquerading as an Xbox If a hacker compromises an Xbox serial number and Online Key pair and the Xbox has not signed up for the service, then they can write a program that would follow our machine account creation protocol and get the Passport machine account long-term password.   The protection against such an attack is checking the machine credentials sent. Any replay of the credentials after a successful account creation or deviation of the protocol (malformed packets, etc) will cause the account to be blocked.  Subsequent attempts will not return any results. Tampering with Data Tampering with data involves the malicious modification of system or user data with or without detection. An unauthorized change made to stored or in-transit information, the formatting of a hard disk, the introduction by a malicious intruder of an undetectable network packet in a communication, and an undetectable change made to a sensitive file are all examples of tampering threats. Tampering with the Machine Account Creation protocols The information in the Kerberos AS cycle is protected by the  Online Key .  Tampering with the encrypted data will be rejected and the data center alerted. Tampering with the Hard Drive This requires access to the hard drive key and the threat model is discussed elsewhere. Repudiability  Repudiability threats are associated with users malicious or otherwise who can deny performing an action without administrators having any way to prove otherwise. An example of a repudiability threat is a user performing an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace such operations. Blocking of a valid account There are situations where a valid account may blocked due to suspicious activity.  An eavesdropper might record the machine account creation protocol and replay it at a later time and block that machine account.  This threat will have to be weighed against the more common scenario of a hacker watching their own Xbox traffic and trying to write a PC program to spoof the system. If the person calls the call center, they can log the issue and unblock the machine account.  Multiple machine account unblocking logs can be investigated and the user banned if malicious activity is highly probable. Information Disclosure Information disclosure threats involve the compromising of private or business-critical information through the exposure of that information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user's ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to and an intruder's ability to read data in transit between two computers are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that in this case the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to appear as a legitimate user. Discovering machine credentials in the Xbox Kerberos AS request The Xbox sends the serial number and machine credentials encrypted with the  Online Key  in the Kerberos AS request.  Access to this information involves breaking the  Online Key .  There is a confounder in the payload so a test against known information in the cipher text is more difficult.   Denial of Service (DoS) Denial of service (DoS) threats when carried out deny service to valid users for example, by making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable or by forcing a reboot or restart of the user's machine. You must protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability. Other types of DoS threats, however, are very hard to protect against; at a minimum, you should identify and rationalize such threats. Denial of Service to the Machine Account Provisioning KDC The MAP KDC must be able to withstand DoS attacks by sending bogus credentials and replaying valid credentials.  It must determine both of these scenarios as quickly as possible and not lock resources that are used for valid credentials.   The quick validity check should be a stateless procedure that can be preformed by the server by checking the keyed hash of the serial number.  After a validity check of the serial number, a SQL query is performed and cached so that subsequent messages with that serial will not cause another SQL query. If valid credentials are replayed without incrementing the sequence number, then the machine account should be suspended until further investigation and the alert that   HYPERLINK  \l "_AID_00000002:_Machine_account creat"  machine account credentials are being replayed  should be triggered.  If invalid credentials were sent, then the alert   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  invalid credentials are being sent  should be triggered. All detected attacks should free all resources and should not return anything back to the Xbox. Elevation of Privilege Not applicable for machine accounts. Compromised Passport KDC A malicious user hacking into the Passport Key Distribution Center and retrieving keys from the Passport database. Importance Needless to say, this would be very serious if it should happen. All of our online authentication security relies on the secrecy of these shared keys. And if the keys are compromised, then most of the vulnerabilities discussed in this section will also be exposed. Attack This is a well known problem with lots of possible attacks and lots of ways to prevent such attacks. We should always keep in mind that a compromised KDC renders everything else we do to ensure online security, completely useless, and because of this we need to do everything in our power to secure our KDC from attacks. The Passport team is well aware of these issues and will put lots of infrastructure in place to guarantee the security of the KDC. Compromised MAP KDC A malicious user hacking into our MAP KDC and retrieving keys from our database. Importance While this vulnerability is serious, it is not as serious as the Passport KDC being compromised. The malicious user with these compromised keys can crack open all the tickets for all the services and be able to access the session keys within the tickets. In reality though, since most malicious users do not have access to the Internet backbone, they will only be able to do this for tickets sent to their own Xbox. With this session key, they will be able to morph, inject, and drop packets send to and from the Xbox, which will give them some game cheating capabilities. Attack This is a well known problem with lots of possible attacks and lots of ways to prevent such attacks.  All keys retrieved from our MAP DB without going through our code on the KDC will be useless as all keys are stored in an encrypted form using public/private keys and nCipher devices.  The encryption will be performed by the system integration test computer during manufacturing.  The decryption requires access to our nCipher device. Cracking an Xbox/User Key over the Network A malicious network user figuring out somebody else s Xbox/User key, without physical access to the Xbox. Importance Most of the security of our authentication protocol relies on the strong Xbox/User key not being known by a malicious user. If a malicious user was able to obtain an Xbox/User key of another Xbox or user, he would be able to impersonate that Xbox/User and purchase online items that would get billed to that Xbox/User. This section only discusses the vulnerability of a malicious network user obtaining the Xbox/User key. The vulnerability of an Xbox owner (or anybody with physical access to the Xbox) figuring out his/her own Xbox/User key (which is easier) is discussed in another section. Attack The Xbox/User key is 128 bits of random data generated by the MAP KDC. It is always encrypted with the hard drive key before being stored on the hard drive of the Xbox and is never sent over the wire in the clear.  We believe this key is secure from a malicious user on the network that does not have physical access to the Xbox. A brute force attack would be out of the question due to the key size.   Cracking Xbox/User Credentials from an MU Machine and/or user credentials that are decrypted and copied from a Memory Unit (MU) to a PC. Importance The machine and user credentials are encrypted with a MU-specific key and stored onto the MU to allow roaming of the user account.  Malicious hardware could copy the credentials off of the MU onto a PC similar to a   drive. Attack The PC now has the credentials of a (possibly) paying customer.  These credentials can be replicated across the network and possible PC spoofing attempts will succeed. This attack needs to be considered in more detail. Cracking the Hard Drive Key A malicious user figuring out the hard drive key of an Xbox that he/she has physical access to. Importance The hard drive key is used to lock the hard drive from usage on a PC. It is also used to encrypt any keys we store on the hard drive. If it is compromised, the malicious user could unlock the hard drive and retrieve and decrypt information like the Xbox key and user keys from the hard drive. Attack The hard drive key is stored on the EEPROM in encrypted form. I am omitting details here to avoid unnecessary info from being leaked out. Most readers of this document do not need to be concerned about the details here, but just need to know that we recognize the risk and have plans in place to secure this key from the owner of the Xbox as much as we can. Authentication Replay Attacks A malicious user could reuse packets sent over the wire to achieve malicious goals. Importance Tickets to the various online services are sent over the wire and a malicious user who sniffs the packets can reuse the tickets to gain services that would otherwise be denied or to replay the packets to deny service to authentication. Attack Most of the attacks in this area have already been thought through when Kerberos was designed. We are relying on the security of the Kerberos protocol to prevent against such attacks.  In addition, we keep a count of how many account creation attempts have been done and block the account after a certain number. Hijacking Xbox Online Service A malicious user hijacking the DNS name resolution of  passport.com  and  xbox.com  and directing all online traffic to his own special Xbox online service. Importance A malicious user that can hijack the DNS resolution of  passport.com  and  xbox.com  for a region of Xbox users could provide an alternate Xbox online service, and deprive Microsoft of the revenue stream. Attack The attacker cannot easily fool an Xbox to create an online account at his site since mutual authentication will be performed by using the Online Key during the Xbox machine account provisioning step.  The generation and storage of the Online Key is discussed at length throughout this document.  The Xbox will not respond if an improperly formed packet comes back from the rogue  MAP KDC Blanking out the Online Key or Passport Machine Account Long-Term Password Arbitrary code executing on the Xbox could write either the Online Key and/or Passport machine account long-term password (and checksums) that would be known to a malicious online service provider. While this Xbox will not be able to create a machine account nor authenticate with Xbox online services, it could connect to another service.  Then the impersonating online server could provide services to these Xbox s from the impersonating servers.  This kind of a scenario could play out in a college dorm where one user legally downloads a lot of expensive content and sets up his own server to provide the content to anybody else in the dorm that allows him to crack open his Xbox and modify the key.  This requires a full scale attack on Xbox keys and each user to actively subvert their Xbox.  This type of attack could also be much more easily carried out by somebody that has stolen the genealogy database and has the nCipher device or private key. Stealing the Xbox Genealogy Database At manufacturing time we record information about every Xbox created into a genealogy database.  The database contains the matching serial number, hard drive key and Online Key for each Xbox. The Online Key will be encrypted with a public key at manufacturing time which deprecates the threat of the genealogy database being stolen without additional information.  The hacker would also need an nCipher device and operator smart card or the private key stored inside the nCipher device.  None of these are easy to accomplish. The hard drive key is still in the database in unencrypted form and thus we still need to keep the database as controlled as possible to prevent people from actively subverting their Xbox. Importance A malicious user that has access to this information can obtain the hard drive of his own Xbox and thus the Passport machine- and user-account long-term passwords.  This allows the user to perform everything associated with  PC emulating an Xbox  and  PC Spoofing as an Xbox However, the malicious user can only do these bad things on their existing Xbox account.  In any case the user still cannot impersonate another Xbox or user that he does not have physical access to. Attack The most obvious attack is to compromise any location that has this database. This database is located at all the manufacturing and refurbishment sites. These sites will most likely have less stringent security measurements and will have lower paid workers that are willing to steal the information for a price, or that are unaware of the importance of this information and more likely to perform actions that compromise the information. This information also makes some kind of journey from the manufacturing facility to the various refurbishment sites.  This exchange must be made very secure also. Operations Machine Account Provisioning KDC The Machine Account Provisioning KDC (MAP KDC) receives the first request from an Xbox to create a machine account, create the Passport machine account and return account information and strong password to the Xbox.   Location The MAP KDC will be located in Building 11 due to the sensitive nature of the data. Performance and Load Considerations This section should contain best estimates of how the feature will perform and impact the service once deployed.  This section should include (but is not limited to) items like the following: Average size of data transferred from Xbox to server and/or server to server Average size of data that is stored on the server by the feature The frequency of this data exchange Maximum data size allowed to be transferred / stored Number of data exchanges the servers will have to support over a given time (i.e. 50 requests / second) Setting message Manually set to immediately return error code One idea is to allow the Operations team to set a message manually that will get returned upon machine account creation attempts. Any messages displayed to the user will have to go through loc, but there are no TCRs required because this is our code. Errors and Alerts Kelly Altom: We should have a standard Alert ID (AID) that all documents reference.  In the ops Alert document, it would list the AID, description, immediate action and process.  This should be put into a  clickable  web interface so that our data center can walk through processes and click to find more information or run commands. Machine account creation attempted without valid credentials AID: 00000001 Description: The MAP KDC received either a malformed packet or the encryption failed. Causes: A DDoS attack is being mounted against the KDC. The Online Key was encrypted with a different version of the public key at manufacturing than the private key stored in the nCipher device (rare) The format of a valid request changed but hasn t been updated on the server. The version of t. Immediate Action:  Watch network traffic to Machine Account Provisioning servers. Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be directed to call center by Xbox. Threat:  Possible DoS attack being mounted by PCs sending bogus credentials. Alert data: Source IP address Serial number of the request Flag whether the packet was malformed or the encryption failed Process: Contact product team with serial number and source IP address for investigation. Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials AID: 00000001 Immediate Action:  Watch network traffic to Machine Account Creation Front-Door servers. Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be directed to call center by Xbox. Threat:  Possible DoS attack being mounted by PCs replaying valid credentials. Alert data: Machine account information Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address (in packet) Process: Disable machine account in credentials if DoS attack is being performed. Contact product team with credentials sent for investigation. Passport Machine Account failure AID: 00000001 Description: Passport cannot create a machine account with the name xnnnnnnnnnnnn@machine.xbox.com where nnnnnnnnnnnn is the 12-digit serial number. Causes: Passport is down or offline. Account name already exists. Data center problems at Passport (disk space, failures, etc) preventing account creation. Our Machine Account Provisioning Database did not record the Passport machine account creation and tried to create a machine account twice. Immediate Action:  See if Passport is up and contact Passport data center if not up. Check if serial number already exists in our Machine Account Provisioning Database and alert Passport that this machine account should be able to be created. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be told to  try again later Threat:  (Rare) possible spoofing attack being mounted by PCs replaying valid credentials with a serial number that already exists in the Passport database. Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address (in packet) MAC address Process: Check Passport. Disable machine account in credentials if spoofing attack is being performed. Contact product team with credentials sent for investigation. Machine Account Provisioning Database write failure AID: 00000001 Description: The MAP KDC cannot set the  account acknowledged  field for the machine account into our MAP DB and therefore cannot create a machine account for a valid user. Causes: Our database is not able to write data (disk space, failures, etc) preventing account creation. Immediate Action:  Check what is happening with our MAP DB. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be told to  try again later Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address Process: Check our MAP DB. nCipher device not responding AID: 00000001 Description: The MAP KDC cannot communicate with its nCipher device.  The device might need a reset, to be power-cycled or replaced. Causes: Lock up or failure of nCipher device. Immediate Action:  Check MAP KDC machine operation. Get operator smart card out of safe. How is this done?  What is the process? Take MAP KDC offline and restart nCipher. Can you restart the nCipher device without taking the machine down?  Is it external? Restart MAP KDC. Replace nCipher with backup unit. Order another nCipher device.  How is this done?  What is the process? A new nCipher device must be procured and initialized to match the scalability requirements (with a minimum of 2 active devices online in case of failover) with 2 more backups owned by dev and test, respectively. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will eventually try another MAP KDC or will be told to  try again later  if no MAP KDCs can operate. Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Server name of MAP KDC Server IP address Scalability of the nCipher devices The consistent load on a device is no more than 50%.  This is determined through perfmon statistics. Machine Account Provisioning Database The Machine Account Provisioning Database (MAP DB) is a SQL server that contains the machine account creation information.   Location The MAP DB will be located in Building 11 due to the sensitive nature of the data. Router Filter TBD: Document all packet formats and how we can filter incoming traffic. Refurbishment There will be several Xbox Repair/Refurbishment centers distributed throughout the world, and in the repair/refurbishment process, an Xbox could easily get its motherboard or hard drive replaced. Because the hard drive is locked with the hard drive key, each refurbished Xbox that wants to use a used hard drive will need to have its original hard drive burned into EEPROM of the new. This means that the genealogy database needs to record the hard drive key and be present at these refurbishment centers.  This needs to happen anyway for other reasons. A lot more work needs to happen here.  No process in place yet. Dependencies Manufacturing and Hardware Operations (HOPS) Contact: Arch Holder The HOPS team needs to provide periodic updates of manufacturing information to the Xbox team. Schedule The first drop of manufacturing data will happen immediately after the first Xbox consoles roll off of the line.  We might not be able to fix those due to cost if there is something wrong.  We will have to rely upon manual account creation through our call center. Call Center operations TBD Stand Alone KDC Contact: John Brezak Schedule The milestone for delivery of our Stand-Alone KDC is 9/15/2001. nCipher Devices and Smartcards Contact: Walt Dorsey Schedule Xbox team has already received 6 nCipher devices and the smart cards necessary. Dashboard requirements Account Sign Up Account sign up is in another document. The dashboard owner is tbd. Machine Reset and Hard Disk Recovery DamonD: This should go into the call center? Product Support User account Sign Up User account sign up is in another document. Machine Account Reset Before any online authentication can be performed, an Xbox account needs to first be created in order to bootstrap the Xbox online authentication process. Both Xbox accounts and user accounts can only be created through the Xbox Dashboard. If an Xbox account key is ever suspected of being compromised, an administrator can reset the Xbox account key and subsequent attempts to logon from that Xbox will fail. The Xbox user will then need to reboot into the dashboard and perform the steps described in this section again to obtain the new key to use for future authentication requests. DamonD: Specific machine reset procedure for the call center Any parts of the feature that are cut from the spec should be moved to this section for consideration in future releases.

"_Toc14522310"  Technical Specifications  PAGEREF _Toc14522310 \h  General Description of the product The Microsoft Xbox Video Game System (Xbox) is Microsoft's future-generation video game system.  The Xbox is a video game console that allows users to play games on television sets.  The Xbox closely resembles a desktop computer in its main specifications: it is powered by an Intel Pentium III 733 MHz processor and an NVIDIA 233 MHz Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).  The Xbox has 64MB of RAM, 1024kb of ROM (firmware), an internal 8 GB hard drive, a 5x DVD-ROM drive with movie playback, 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port, broadband compatibility and HDTV support. The Xbox will be generally available for purchase by the public through retail outlets independent of Microsoft, and will be sold in large volume without restriction through mail order, electronic and telephone sales.  Microsoft will distribute the Xbox its mass-market retail channel distribution system, including thousands of resellers and distributors.  This product will be available to customers from many third-party resellers via various combinations of retail presence, web, phone or mail order.  The recommended retail price of an Xbox is $299. Despite its many functions   video games, DVD and music CDROM playback, Internet connectivity to gaming servers and websites - the Xbox is not a general purpose computer that can host arbitrary applications; it is designed primarily for online and local gaming. Game titles are distributed on Xbox Game Media in a special DVD format or downloaded via the Xbox online service.  The Xbox System Software (XSS) is statically linked into the game title DVD and has been pared down to the essential functions for fast and stable operation as a gaming platform. No cryptographic algorithms are contained in the code of the title.  All cryptographic algorithms are stored in the firmware of the Xbox.   The purpose of this technical part is to disclose encryption in the Xbox which is mainly related to the use of the Xbox Secure Protocol (XSP) at the network level. XSP is used to secure communication between several Xbox consoles in System Link Play mode and Online Play mode. System Link Play is a mode of play where several Xbox consoles are connected on a LAN for multi-player gaming.  Online Play is a mode where an Xbox console is communicating over the Internet with our online service or with another Xbox console.  Further information about the Xbox product may found on the Xbox web site at   HYPERLINK "http://www.xbox.com"  http://www.xbox.com Technical Overview of system The technical specifications are located in the Appendix. Xbox Hardware Components Central Processing Unit (CPU) The Xbox runs on a Pentium III 733 MHz chip.  Intel s website for CTP calculations list this chip at just over 1710 MTOPs.  (  HYPERLINK "http://support.intel.com/support/processors/ctp.htm#13"  http://support.intel.com/support/processors/ctp.htm#13 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) The Xbox GPU (XGPU) is a graphics processor capable of a 3D vector rate of less than 100 million.  Hard drive (HD) The Xbox contains an 8MB (or larger) hard drive that stores data cached from the game title DVD, downloaded games and content, Kerberos user account credentials, Kerberos machine account credentials, and machine and user settings. Memory Unit (MU) The standard Xbox Game Controller supports up to 2 slots that can accept Memory Units.  A memory unit is a cartridge that can store game data and user credentials.  The MU may be removed so that data can roam with the user. General Cryptographic Principles There are some principles that help understand the design goals and cryptography of the Xbox: No cryptographic algorithms are contained in the code of the title.  All cryptographic algorithms are stored in the firmware of the device. Game developers cannot directly access the cryptography algorithms in the Xbox firmware for generic encryption services.  All access to these algorithms is done by the XSS with set purposes described below.  The game title code statically links with the XSS. The XSS is only accessible to approved Xbox game developers, not to the Xbox user or general public. The XSS only exposes functionality for purposes of securing data from the Xbox (e.g. authentication, System Link Play gaming data, credit card information, etc). There are specific algorithms and key lengths in the XSS that cannot be replaced or enhanced by the developer or the user. The exposed services define one transport encryption means (modified IPSec). The Xbox is not designed for significant user-defined secret messaging. System Link Play System Link Play is when two Xbox consoles are directly connected together via a network cable or into the same Ethernet hub.  System Link Play does not include  Online Play  where Xbox consoles are connected to our online service over the Internet. There are no trusted 3rd party authentication mechanisms in this scenario so an alternative method of mutual authentication is described below. Online Play This document will describe: the method of authenticating Xbox consoles to the online service (and authenticating the online service to the Xbox console); how session keys are created, stored and exchanged; and how network traffic is protected.  Encryption Algorithms All cryptographic algorithms that are used by the game titles are located in the firmware shipped with the Xbox hardware.  The game titles use these algorithms for network authentication, network traffic encryption, key exchange, data encryption, content signing and content verification.   The processes for network authentication, network traffic encryption and key exchange for System Link Play are disclosed in this document.  A later submission will include Internet play. The processes of content encryption, signing and verification used for software copy protection schemes are not disclosed in this document. Location of cryptographic algorithms All cryptographic algorithms are located in the firmware of the Xbox.  Only the Xbox System Software provided by Microsoft can access the cryptography routines in firmware.  The game title code cannot directly access these methods for generic cryptography services, but must use the XSS code to perform tasks securely. These algorithms and key sizes are enabled: Component Algorithm-Key Length(s) Xbox Firmware DES-56 3DES-168 RC4-128 RC4-384 SHA1-HMAC-128 RSA-1024 RSA-2048 DH-KEYX-768 DH-KEYX-1024 DH-KEYX-2048 Xbox System Software MD5-128  MD5-HMAC-128 Xbox Game Titles Usage of cryptographic algorithms Traditionally, gaming systems with a dedicated console were standalone machines that accommodated a limited number of players (e.g., 2-4 players).  Personal computer-based gaming grew in popularity in part due to the ability to play games online with many remote players over the Internet.  Thus, one trend for dedicated gaming systems is to provide capabilities to facilitate gaming over a network, such Internet-based online gaming and LAN-based gaming where multiple consoles are connected through a local area network (LAN).  One challenge in network gaming is to protect network traffic between any two game consoles from tampering or observation by other devices on the network.  Gamers are notorious for developing creative cheating mechanisms.  For example, gamers have used computers to display portions of a game map which would otherwise not be visible, or modified unprotected network traffic to give themselves advantages during play, such as perfect aim, faster players, and so on.  Unfortunately, previous console-based gaming systems did not provide for secure communications.   Accordingly, there is a need for a system architecture that supports secure communications between two or more gaming systems over a local area network. Cryptography algorithms and where they are used: Component Used Algorithms-Key Length(s) DES-56 3DES-168 SHA1-HMAC-160 MD5-HMAC-128 RC4-HMAC-128 DH-KEYX-768 Development and Debugging Approved game developers receive an Xbox Development Kit (XDK) that contains special hardware for development and debugging.  This is the only hardware configuration that allows development and debugging (or tracing through executing code).  Code compiled for the special development hardware will not run on a retail Xbox console nor will retail Xbox Game Media be loaded by the special development hardware. Key Management Keys are used for System Link Play: Size (bits) Location Usage ROM Key Used to generate LAN Key Title Key Used to generate LAN Key LAN Key Memory LAN key is shared by the same title and allows System Link Play Broadcast encryption key Memory Generated by LAN key and used to encrypt broadcast traffic Broadcast signing key Memory Generated by LAN key and used to sign broadcast traffic Memory Randomly generated key unique to gaming session Security Association keys Memory Shared by a pair to encrypt/sign traffic between them Keys are used for Online Play: Size (bits) Location Usage Online Key EEPROM Used to obtain Machine Credentials Machine Key Hard Drive Used to authenticate machine to Kerberos KDC User Keys HD or MU Used to authenticate users to Kerberos KDC Cached Kerberos Ticket and Session Keys Hard Drive Generated by LAN key and used to encrypt broadcast traffic Matchmaking Session Key Memory Randomly generated key unique to gaming session Security Association keys Memory Shared by a pair to encrypt/sign traffic between them The keys for content encryption, signing and verification for software copy protection are not disclosed in this document. Xbox Secure Network Library (XSNL) All game title code must use the Xbox Secure Network Library (XSNL) to communicate with any other device over the network.  Games cannot write their own net stack that communicates directly with the hardware.  This is a requirement for certification as an Xbox Game Title.  The game title code does not directly call the authentication and encryption code, but instead uses a higher-level abstraction to connect.  All of the underlying security described below is performed by the XSNL. In an effort to deter cheating, re-tasking, mapping, denial of service, and other forms of malicious attacks on the Xbox through the Ethernet port, all Xbox to Xbox and Xbox to server communication will use the XSP format to authenticate and encrypt the contents of each packet.  The purpose of this document is to describe the layout of each packet type transmitted by an Xbox, the algorithms used to secure these packets, the state machine run by each endpoint, as well as the specific encryption, authentication, and transformations performed to the data and keys, including how each type of key is generated. There are three communication scenarios that are supported by the Xbox.  The first is called System Link Play, which is defined as two or more Xboxes connected via an Ethernet crossover cable or via an Ethernet hub.  It is assumed that all such Xboxes can be reached via Ethernet broadcast, and that these Xboxes will only communicate with other Xboxes.  The second is called Online Server Play, which is defined as an Xbox being logged on to the Xbox Live service and communicating with a game server that is hosted in a data center fronted by a bank of security gateways.  Finally, there is Online Peer Play, which is defined as two or more Xboxes which are all logged on to the Xbox Live service and are communicating peer-to-peer across the Internet. Xbox Secure Protocol (XSP) The Xbox will include a derivative implementation of the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) modified to work through Network Address Translation devices (NATs).  The Xbox team refers to this modification as the Xbox Secure Protocol, but it will be listed and described as   throughout the document. Kerberos Kerberos is used as a trusted 3rd party authentication mechanism between an Xbox console and our online service, then once authenticated, our service acts as a trusted 3rd party between Xbox consoles. Kerberos is the protocol used to create, authenticate and establish machine and user accounts.  Kerberos is a standard protocol described in RFC 1510.  We use user-specific fields (so-called  Pre-Auth  fields) for our service-specific information.  These fields are described below. Security Gateway The Xbox console always connects to the online service through a security gateway.  The security gateway authenticates the Xbox, validates and encrypts data coming from an Xbox console to the online service, and encrypts and signs data going to the Xbox console from the online service. A security gateway is a Windows computer with multiple network interface cards that is running a custom kernel-mode NDIS filter written by the Xbox team.  One or more network interfaces are connected to the Internet, and one or more network interfaces are connected to the datacenter local area network.  The purpose of the gateway is to be a secure endpoint for Xbox clients.  It performs a secure key exchange with the Xbox client using Kerberos for mutual authentication, authenticates and decrypts XSP packets inbound from Xbox clients on the Internet and forwards them as plain UDP or TCP packets to servers in the datacenter, and encrypts and digitally signs plain UDP or TCP response packets from the servers in the datacenter and forwards them to the Xbox clients as XSP packets. Hard Drive Key A unique hard drive key is stored in the EEPROM of each manufactured Xbox along with the online key. All sensitive data that is stored on an Xbox hard drive is signed with this hard drive key. For even more sensitive data, we use the hard drive key to encrypt the stored data. The hard drive key and the online key of each Xbox should typically be unknown to the owner of the Xbox. A user would need to open up the Xbox and perform a hardware sniff at the correct pins to obtain the value of the hard drive key for their Xbox. Doing so would only compromise the keys for that particular Xbox and would not compromise the keys for any other unit. Xbox Secure Network Library (XSNL) The Xbox Secure Network Library is a static library written by the Xbox online team to provide access to the Ethernet hardware on the Xbox.  It was designed to be familiar and easy for game developers to use while providing security, efficiency with network bandwidth, solving the NAT traversal problem, and solving the voice-in-the-clear problem. From the game developer perspective, the secure network library exposes the familiar WinSock 2.0 API and adds just a few Xbox-specific API s.  The game developer can open both datagram (UDP) sockets as well as stream (TCP) sockets for communication to other Xboxes or to game servers.  At the game developer level all data is transmitted and received in the clear. Under the covers, the secure network library transforms the game s UDP and TCP packets into a custom packet format called XSP (described in the next section).  This packet format was carefully designed to satisfy the remaining requirements mentioned above. It provides security because the original UDP or TCP data (excluding headers) is automatically encrypted on the wire, and the entire packet payload is digitally signed using pair wise keys that are exchanged between the two secure endpoints before communication is started.  The entire key exchange phase and encryption and authentication is transparent to the game developer. It provides network bandwidth efficiency by automatically eliminating portions of the original UDP or TCP packet that are not necessary for transport (such as the 2-byte UDP/TCP checksum which is not needed because we are already using a much stronger SHA-1 hashing algorithm), and it also encodes the source and destination ports as efficiently as possible (including not transmitting them at all if the game chooses to send and receive on port 1000).  In the optimal case, the secure network library adds a total of 16 bytes of overhead to each secure packet.  Compare that to 38 bytes per packet for standard IPSec ESPUDP encoding. The NAT traversal problem has plagued network game developers for years.  The issue with a Network Address Translator (NAT) is that it prevents unsolicited inbound network communication, which effectively blocks peer-to-peer game traffic since neither game host will have any Internet presence at all until it initiates outgoing communication to the other.  The catch, of course, is that if neither host has an Internet presence, then there is no IP address for either side to start sending packets to.  The XSP encoding of secure packets encodes all traffic as UDP packets, and does so using a single source port.  This simplifies the problem to figuring out how to open a single inbound port mapping for all secure traffic to and from the Xbox.  The secure network library has algorithms for automatically opening port mappings for most types of NAT devices found in homes today, and has support for using UPnP to programmatically assign a port mapping to the Xbox.  The game developer does not need to worry about any of these issues as the secure network library NAT traversal algorithms are enabled automatically as necessary to establish connectivity. By default all data sent by a game is encrypted by the secure network library.  For some types of data, however, this is not desirable.  In order to avoid the issue of wire-tap laws in some jurisdictions or countries, the library provides a means for transmitting voice data in the clear.  This is accomplished by providing a custom socket type called VDP, which stands for voice-and-data protocol.  This socket behaves exactly like a datagram socket, except that all messages send on such a socket must be prefixed with a two-byte integer (in Intel byte order) which specifies the number of bytes of data immediately following that are to be encrypted on the wire.  The remaining bytes in the message are considered voice data and are transmitted in the same packet in clear-text.  The target Xbox side will receive a message in the same format that the sender sent it, namely prefixed with a two-byte integer (in Intel byte order) followed by the remainder of the message.  Once again, the game developer only ever sends or receives clear-text.  All encryption, encoding, signing, and verification is handled automatically and is transparent to the game developer. Xbox Secure Protocol (XSP) Overview In an effort to deter cheating, hardware retasking, mapping, denial of service, and other forms of malicious attacks on the Xbox console through the Ethernet port, all Xbox to Xbox and Xbox to server communication will use the XSP format to authenticate and encrypt the contents of each packet.  The purpose of this document is to describe the layout of each packet type transmitted by an Xbox, the algorithms used to secure these packets, the state machine run by each endpoint, as well as the specific encryption, authentication, and transformations performed to the data and keys, including how each type of key is generated. XSP is a derivative implementation of the Internet Protocol Security that we call IPSec ESPUDP.  The modification was necessary to allow traffic to flow through Network Address Translation devices (NATs) that may not understand the proposed IETF standard format that places the ESP header between the IP header and the transport layer header.  The modification is documented below. An Xbox will be able to negotiate XSP sessions with external devices on the Internet using 56-bit DES or 168-bit 3DES session keys.  XSP is embedded as an integral part of the XSNL.  XSP provides security services for IP version 4 (RFC 791) at the IP layer. The set of security services that XSP provides are access control, connectionless integrity, protection against replayed packets (a form of partial sequence integrity), confidentiality (encryption). Because these services are provided at the IP layer, they are automatically in place for any game traffic regardless of transport layer (UDP or TCP). XSP can be used to protect one or more "paths" between a pair of Xbox consoles.  Using XSP, two Xbox consoles can mutually authenticate (machine to machine) with a peer system before transmitting or receiving application data between them.  In this sense, XSP is a security service provided by the XSNL, transparently, for game data. The IPSec architectural design was developed as a series of RFC specification documents by the IPSec Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  See   HYPERLINK "http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html"  http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html  for updated standards information.  XSP was derived from, but is not close to nor does conform to to the RFC specifications listed in the References section as IPSec does not work through Network Address Translation devices (NATs).   The RFC defines two protocols to provide traffic security   Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). The IP Authentication Header (AH) provides connectionless integrity, data origin authentication, and an optional anti-replay service.  The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides confidentiality (encryption), connectionless integrity and an anti-replay service.  Both AH and ESP are vehicles for access control, based on the distribution of cryptographic keys and the management of traffic flows relative to these security protocols.  These protocols may be applied alone or in combination with each other to provide a desired set of security services in IPv4 (and eventually IPv6).  Each protocol supports two modes of use: transport mode and tunnel mode.  XSP was derived from the ESP protocol. Encryption functions The following provides a description of the cryptographic functions offered by the product. XSP supports DES (56bit key strength) encryption algorithm, 3DES (168bit key strength) encryption algorithm, SHA-1 integrity algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman technique for shared symmetric key generation in a new protocol that does not conform to the key exchange protocol (Internet Key Exchange or IKE) of IPSec.   Xbox Secure Packet (XSP) Format The secure packet format is used to encode encrypted and signed data between two Xbox consoles or between an Xbox and a Security Gateway (SG).  On the wire the packet is formatted as a UDP packet typically with source and destination ports both set to 3074.  The format is capable of transmitting the SEC, TCP, UDP, and VDP protocols.  The layout of an XSP packet is shown below.    +CXspHdr----------+cbDat-------------+      +cbTvo+CXspTail--------------------------+  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |IP|UDP|dwSpiAndFlags|CryptData|CryptPad|      |Voice|wSeqLo|abHash                     | |20|8  |4            |Var      |0 thru 7|      |Var  |2     |10                         | |      |bFlags                   |Ports|TcpInfo|     |      |wSeqHi|dwSpiAndFlags|dwZero| |      |1                        |0/2/4|12     |     |      |2     |4            |4     | +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+                                +cbPad---+      |                                  +cbTov-+      |                                  +cbTex--------+ The first byte of the UDP payload is the bFlags byte and it determines the layout of the remainder.  It consists of two bit fields.  The low 5 bits determine the protocol and layout of the remainder of the packet (i.e. the "type"), and the high 3 bits store the amount of padding that was added to the encrypted data area to make it a multiple of 8 bytes.  Currently there are 16 types, as shown below. Definition Original Format Bytes Per Port XSP_TYPE_SEC XSP_TYPE_TCP_0 XSP_TYPE_TCP_1 XSP_TYPE_TCP_2 XSP_TYPE_UDP_0 XSP_TYPE_UDP_1 XSP_TYPE_UDP_2 XSP_TYPE_VDP_0 XSP_TYPE_VDP_1 XSP_TYPE_VDP_2 XSP_TYPE_VDP_VO_0 VDP (voice only) XSP_TYPE_VDP_VO_1 VDP (voice only) XSP_TYPE_VDP_VO_2 VDP (voice only) XSP_TYPE_VDP_DO_0 VDP (data only) XSP_TYPE_VDP_DO_1 VDP (data only) XSP_TYPE_VDP_DO_2 VDP (data only) The dwSpiAndFlags field of the CXspHdr is the security parameters index that identifies the security association established with the other side during key exchange.  The low byte of this DWORD (in Intel byte order) carries the bFlags byte described above.  A dwSpiAndFlags of zero is a special case that marks the packet as a key exchange packet instead of a data packet.  The format of a key exchange packet is described later in this document. The CryptData and CryptPad fields carry the encrypted data.  The sum of these two fields is always a multiple of 8 bytes.  The cbDat variable shown above describes the sum of these two fields.  The cbPad variable describes the amount of padding that needs to be added to make CryptData a multiple of 8 bytes.  To determine the actual amount of game data being transported, subtract cbPad from cbDat.  These two fields are encrypted using the DES or 3DES algorithms.  The algorithm used depends on the outcome key exchange, or is well-known in the case of System Link play (3DES for broadcast packets and DES for game traffic).  Note that there is no explicit initialization vector carried in the packet.  To prevent two packets containing the same clear-text from encrypting to the same cipher-text, an implicit IV is calculated based on a initial IV (generated as a result of key exchange) and the full four-byte sequence number of the packet.  The algorithm for computing the IV at a given sequence number is shown below. void IpCalcIvAtSeq(const BYTE * pbIvInit, DWORD dwSeq, BYTE * pbIvCalc)     QWORD qw1 = UInt32x32To64(((DWORD *)pbIvInit)[0], dwSeq);     QWORD qw2 = UInt32x32To64(((DWORD *)pbIvInit)[1], dwSeq);     ((DWORD *)pbIvCalc)[0] = ((DWORD *)&qw1)[0] ^ ((DWORD *)&qw2)[1];     ((DWORD *)pbIvCalc)[1] = ((DWORD *)&qw1)[1] ^ ((DWORD *)&qw2)[0]; The UDP/TCP/VDP game developer specified source and destination ports are encoded in 0, 2, or 4 bytes, depending on their values.  If the title uses source port 1000 and destination port 1000, the Ports field will be zero bytes long.  Otherwise, if the title uses source port between 1000 and 1255 and destination port between 1000 and 1255, the Ports field will be 2 bytes long, where each byte encodes the port number minus 1000.  Otherwise, the Ports field is 4 bytes long and stores the full source and destination ports. For TCP packets, the TcpInfo field contains the "middle" 12 bytes of a standard TCP header (20 bytes).  The first four bytes of the standard TCP header are the source and destination ports, and they are encoded as shown above.  The final four bytes of the standard TCP header are the checksum and the wUrgent fields.  There is no need to transport the checksum since our packet format is digitally signed using a much stronger hashing algorithm (SHA-1).  And since the Xbox does not support out-of-band urgent data on a TCP stream, there is no need to transmit the wUrgent field. The cbTex variable is simply the sum of the size of the Ports and TcpInfo fields.  This can be anywhere from zero bytes long (for SEC packets, or for UDP/VDP packets whose source and destination ports are both 1000), up to a maximum of 16 bytes (for TCP packets whose source and/or destination port is outside the range 1000 through 1255). The cbTov variable is computed as min(cbPad, cbTex).  It describes the number of bytes of the Ports and TcpInfo fields that are overlapped with the CryptPad area of the packet.  To save space on the wire, the Ports and TcpInfo fields are used to pad out the CryptData area to make it a multiple of 8 bytes (instead of just padding with zeroes).  This means that you can't necessarily tell what the source or destination ports, or what the dwSeqNum or dwAckNum fields of the TcpInfo header are by examining a NETMON capture because these fields might have been opportunistically encrypted.  However, it is always possible to tell what type of TCP packet this is (SYN/FIN/ACK/RST) because the TCP flags are at least 8 bytes into the TcpInfo field, and the maximum amount of overlap is 7 bytes. For VDP packets, unencrypted voice data is carried in the Voice field.  The variable cbTvo describes the size of this field.  If this packet is of type XSP_TYPE_VDP_0/1/2, the last byte of this field specifies the size of the CryptData and CryptPad fields in units of 8 bytes.  This byte only exists in the packet if there is both voice and data present.  If only data is carried in the packet, the packet type is marked XSP_TYPE_VDP_DO_0/1/2 (DO means "data-only").  If only voice is carried in the packet, the packet type is marked XSP_TYPE_VDP_VO_0/1/2 (VO means "voice-only"). At the very end of packet is the CXspTail structure.  This is a fixed size structure which consists of a two-byte sequence number (wSeqLo) followed by 10 bytes of digital signature (abHash).  Note that only the low two-bytes of the implied four-byte sequence number are transmitted in the packet.  The secure endpoints maintain enough state to infer the full sequence number (we assume that an endpoint won t miss approximately 32,000 packets without also losing the connection entirely).   The digital signature is computed using the HMAC-SHA-1 algorithm.  First, a pseudo-header is created by filling in the abHash field with the two high bytes of the sequence number (wSeqHi), followed by a copy of the dwSpiAndFlags field from earlier in the packet.  The last four bytes are filled with zeroes.  The hashing begins just after the CryptPad field and continues to the end of the abHash field, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 4 bytes.  Note that the dwZero field at the very end of the packet is used to zero-pad the packet to make sure that rounding down to the nearest four-byte multiple will still hash all of the real data in the packet.   Finally, the hashing continues by wrapping around and including the CryptData and CryptPad fields of the packet.  The reason for hashing the packet in this manner has to do with the limitations of certain crypto hardware offload cards.  These cards are capable of hashing and encrypting in a single pass, but require that the encrypted portion start after an optional  hash-only section which must be a multiple of 4 bytes long.  If software encryption and authentication is being performed, the payload is first encrypted, and then the entire payload is digitally signed.  Note that the packet contains only the first 10 bytes of the 20 byte digest computed, and that this is two bytes less than the 12 bytes transmitted in IPSec ESP packets. An important point to keep in mind from a security perspective is that the [IP] header and the outer [UDP] header are neither encrypted nor digitally signed.  We must therefore assume that any or all of these fields can be spoofed by the sender, or modified in transit. XNKID and XNKEY There may be more than one Xbox hosting a game session at any given time.  While this is unlikely when there are only a handful of Xboxes connected on a small local network during System Link Play, there can be thousands of online game sessions available at any given time which can be queried from the Xbox Live matchmaking service. We distinguish between different sessions by defining an XNKID, or XNet Key Identifier, and an XNKEY, or XNet Key Exchange Key.  The XNKID is simply a name for the XNKEY.  The first four bits of the XNKID are used to distinguish between different types of game sessions, as shown below. typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[8];                      // key identifier } XNKID; #define XNET_XNKID_MASK             0xF0    // Mask of flag bits in first byte #define XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK      0x00    // Peer to peer system link session #define XNET_XNKID_ONLINE_PEER      0x80    // Peer to peer online session #define XNET_XNKID_ONLINE_SERVER    0xC0    // Client to server online session typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[16];                     // key exchange key } XNKEY; A title which is hosting a System Link game session generates an XNKID / XNKEY pair by calling the function XNetCreateKey.  This implementation of this function simply runs the random number generator to fill in both structures, and sets the type bits in first byte of the XNKID to XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK.  The other types of XNKID / XNKEY pairs are generated by the matchmaking service or the game server. A pair of Xboxes that want to communicate will have to obtain the same XNKID / XNKEY pairs (we describe how below) and each must call XNetRegisterKey with these values.  Once registered, you can think of the Xbox as listening for incoming key-exchange requests from other Xboxes on this XNKID.  Once a game session is finished, the title calls XNetUnregisterKey to stop accepting key-exchange requests from any Xbox using this XNKID / XNKEY pair.  The duration of a XNKID / XNKEY pair will be anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours at most. The XNKEY part of the pair is used to authenticate the contents of key exchange packets.  The XNKID is carried in the payload of the key exchange packet to specify which game session the source Xbox is connecting to, and the corresponding XNKEY is used to compute an HMAC-SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet.  If the target Xbox has registered the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, it will have an entry in its table of registered keys and will therefore be able to compute the same HMAC-SHA-1 hash to authenticate the packet. XNADDR The Xbox Secure Network Library extends the notion of a network address from a simple four-byte IP address to a structure of type XNADDR.  The format of an XNADDR is shown below. typedef struct {     IN_ADDR     ina;                // IP address (zero if not static/DHCP)     IN_ADDR     inaOnline;          // Online IP address (zero if not online)     WORD        wPortOnline;        // Online port     BYTE        abEnet[6];          // Ethernet MAC address     BYTE        abOnline[20];       // Online identification } XNADDR; The reason for this level of abstraction is because the IP address of an Xbox, especially one that is behind a NAT, is not enough to establish connectivity.   Many different Xboxes could be configured with the same IP address 192.168.0.1, for example, yet each has a unique external IP address and source port assigned by the NAT.  In the case of System Link Play, an Xbox will not even have an IP address at all.  It will only have an Ethernet MAC address.  This address is also carried in the XNADDR structure.  Besides being useful for addressing Ethernet frames, it is also a useful unique identifier of the Xbox that we will use in the key exchange state machine described later. For security reasons, we would like to keep the contents of an XNADDR hidden from the casual observer since it contains addressing information that would be useful to a hacker, so any packet that contains one or more of these structures must be encrypted.  Just because an XNADDR is transmitted to an Xbox doesn t mean that the Xbox will establish communication with that address.  It might have gotten a whole list of XNADDR to different potential game hosts and will only end up picking one.  While there is no way to prevent the hacker from seeing which IP address is being used by examining the IP packets, we don t want to give the hacker any more information about other Xbox addresses than is absolutely necessary. System Link Shared Secret Each title that is certified to play on an Xbox contains a unique randomly generated title key that can be found in the XBE (Xbox executable) certificate.   This key is the same for every copy of the same title, but is different on different titles, and is 16-bytes long.  We assume that the XBE certificate is somewhat difficult to read because the DVD format of an Xbox game is not readable with today s DVD drives, but it is certainly readable with any Xbox development kit, and no doubt will be easily readable in the future.  We cannot assume that the title key in the certificate will remain secret. In order to bootstrap the System Link key exchange process, we need to come up with a shared secret that only an Xbox running a given title will know.  This shared secret will be used to authenticate the Xbox to another Xbox and to encrypt broadcast traffic between these Xboxes during the host discovery phase before key exchange has taken place.   This shared secret is computed in two phases.  The XBE loader does the first phase by computing an HMAC-SHA-1 operation on the 16-byte key found in the XBE certificate using a key stored in the ROM.  We call this key the LAN key.  When the network stack is initialized, we perform two HMAC-SHA-1 operations (pre-pending a 0x00 byte and then a 0x01 byte) using this LAN key to produce two 20-byte digests.  The first 16-bytes of the digests are used as the title broadcast SHA key, and the remaining 24-bytes are used as the title broadcast 3DES key.  This 3DES key will have its parity bits set correctly.  One last digest is generated (by pre-pending a 0x02 byte), and the first 8 bytes of this digest are used as the initial IV for encrypting the contents of broadcast traffic using the 3DES algorithm. The process of generating the title broadcast keys and initial IV is done once at XNet initialization time.  All Xboxes running the same title will generate the same pair of keys and initial IV.  Any Xbox running a different title on the same network will have a different pair of keys.   We presume that it is somewhat difficult for a non-Xbox to figure out what these keys are.  Due to their fixed nature, however, it only needs to be discovered once and then the title broadcast keys are compromised forever for that particular title.  System Link Session Discovery After a title initializes XNet, the next step is to discover if there are any other Xboxes running the same title that are hosting a System Link game session.  Because there is no third-party matchmaking service available in System Link Play, the title must use Ethernet broadcast to perform this discovery. The System Link discovery process involves a game host calling XNetCreateKey to generate a unique XNKID / XNKEY pair, calling XNetRegisterKey, opening a UDP socket and listening for discovery broadcasts from one or more clients.  The response to the discovery broadcast is a response packet (also transmitted via broadcast) which contains (at a minimum) the XNKID / XNKEY pair as well as the XNADDR of the game host.  When the client receives the response, it calls XNetRegisterKey with the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, and then calls XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR into an IP address that can be used to open a UDP to TCP socket to the host. Because these discovery packets contain XNKEY and XNADDR structures, they must be encrypted.  The stack automatically encrypts and authenticates any packet sent via broadcast by using the title broadcast SHA key and title broadcast 3DES key described earlier.  Using this discovery process, a game client can discover the list of game hosts available on the local network and can choose which it wishes to communicate with by calling XNetRegisterKey with the XNKID / XNKEY pair of the chosen host.  All other XNKID / XNKEY pairs should be discarded.  Online Peer Session Discovery An Xbox that is logged on to the Xbox Live service will use the matchmaking service to obtain a list of game sessions.  The response to a query of the matchmaking service includes a list of XNKID / XNKEY pairs and the XNADDR of each game host, along with criteria for selecting among them.  Once a session is selected, the title calls XNetRegisterKey with the chosen XNKID / XNKEY pair, and then calls XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the chosen XNADDR into an IP address that can be used to open a UDP or TCP socket to the host. Xbox Key Exchange After game session discovery we now have two Xboxes that share the same XNKID / XNKEY pair.  Each Xbox has called XNetRegisterKey with its XNKID / XNKEY pair, and the game client has called XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR of the game host into an IP address. For the purpose of key exchange, let us consider the game client to be the initiator or the key exchange, and the game host to be the responder.  When the game client sends the first packet to the IP address obtained by the call to XNetXnAddrToInAddr, the XNet stack notices that there is no security association established between the game client and game host.  This means that there are no SHA or DES keys that are required to compute the authentication hash and optionally to encrypt the packet.  The packet is placed on a packet queue and the key exchange process is started. When XNetRegisterKey is called with an XNKID / XNKEY pair, a CKeyReg structure is allocated and filled. struct CKeyReg     XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier     BYTE            _abKeySha[16];      // key exchange SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyDes[24];      // key exchange DES key     BYTE            _abDhX[CBDHG1];     // diffie-hellman X value     BYTE            _abDhGX[CBDHG1];    // diffie-hellman g^X value In addition to remembering the XNKID, it also holds the computed SHA and DES keys.  These keys are generated from the XNKEY passed in to XNetRegisterKey by computing two 20-byte digests.  The first digest is computed as HMAC-SHA-1(XNKID | XNKEY) and the second digest is computed the same way except that the first byte in XNKID is incremented by one.  The first 16 bytes of these two digests is used as the SHA key, and the last 24 bytes is used as the DES key (with parity bits set appropriately).  Further, it is at this time that the Diffie-Hellman X value is randomly generated and the g^X value is computed.  The client will use the same X and g^X values for every key-exchange peer that mentions this XNKID.   We use the 768-bit Oakley Group 1 constants for the Diffie-Hellman algorithms. When XNetXnAddrToInAddr is called with an XNADDR and a XNKID, a CSecReg structure is allocated and filled. struct CSecReg     WORD            _wFlags;                // See SRF_* above     BYTE            _bState;                // See SR_STATE_* above     BYTE            _bRetry;                // Number of retries remaining     DWORD           _dwSpiRecv;             // SPI assigned by this side     DWORD           _dwSpiXmit;             // SPI assigned by other side     DWORD           _dwSeqRecv;             // Base sequence of receive window     DWORD           _dwSeqMask;             // Bit mask of seq numbers received     DWORD           _dwSeqXmit;             // Highest seq number transmitted     DWORD           _dwTickRecv;            // TimerTick when last packet recv     DWORD           _dwTickXmit;            // TimerTick when last packet xmit     DWORD           _dwTickPulse;           // TimerTick when last pulse xmit     DWORD           _dwTickPulseTimeout;    // Inactivity before sending pulse     DWORD           _dwTickTimeout;         // Inactivity before timing out     CPacketQueue    _pqWait;                // Queue of packets waiting     CTimer          _timer;                 // Timer for scheduling timeouts     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];        // Nonce generated by the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceResp[8];        // Nonce generated by the responder     BYTE            _abKeyShaRecv[16];      // Negotiated incoming SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyDesRecv[24];      // Negotiated incoming DES crypt key     BYTE            _abIvRecv[8];           // Negotiated incoming starting IV     WORD            _cbKeyDesRecv;          // Size of incoming DES crypt key     BYTE            _abKeyShaXmit[16];      // Negotiated outgoing SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyDesXmit[24];      // Negotiated outgoing DES crypt key     BYTE            _abIvXmit[8];           // Negotiated outgoing starting IV     WORD            _cbKeyDesXmit;          // Size of outgoing DES crypt key     CIpAddr         _ipaDst;                // Destination IP address     CIpPort         _ipportDst;             // Destination port     CKeyReg *       _pKeyReg;               // Pointer to corresponding CKeyReg     XNADDR          _xnaddr;                // XNADDR of the destination     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;                // Highest time value #define SR_STATE_IDLE               0       // key exchange not started  #define SR_STATE_INITSENT           1       // initiator packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_RESPSENT           2       // response packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_INITWAIT           3       // initiator waiting for responder #define SR_STATE_READY              4       // key exchange is complete This structure describes a security association between this host and the host with the given XNADDR.  There will be one security association for every unique XNADDR / XNKID pair.  We use the Ethernet address in the XNADDR structure to determine unique address, as it remains fixed to the Xbox whereas the IP address can be reassigned. A key-exchange packet is a UDP packet whose payload starts with four bytes of zeroes.  These bytes distinguish the packet as a key exchange packet instead of a data packet.  The rest of the UDP payload consists of a series of type / length prefixed payloads (see CKeyExHdr below).  A well-formed Xbox to Xbox key exchange message will contain at least three such payloads, the first of which must be of type KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_INIT (if sent by the initiator) or KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_RESP (if sent by the responder), one of type KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX, and the last of type KEYEX_TYPE_HMAC_SHA.  To support future new features, there can be other payloads inserted between the required first and last payloads, and if they exist an Xbox which doesn t understand them will ignore them. struct CKeyExHdr     #define KEYEX_VERSION           0x0000  // Current KeyEx version     #define KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_INIT  0x5800  // CKeyExXbToXb | DH_GX | HMAC_SHA     #define KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_RESP  0x5801  // CKeyExXbToXb | DH_GX | HMAC_SHA     #define KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOSG_INIT  0x5802  // CKeyExXbToSgInit | DH_GX | APREQ     #define KEYEX_TYPE_SGTOXB_RESP  0x5803  // CKeyExSgToXbResp | DH_GX | APREP     #define KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX        0x5880  // diffie-hellman g^X (or g^Y)     #define KEYEX_TYPE_HMAC_SHA     0x5881  // HMAC-SHA-1 digest (XbToXb)     #define KEYEX_TYPE_KERB_APREQ   0x5882  // CKeyExKerbApReq (XbToSg)     #define KEYEX_TYPE_KERB_APREP   0x5883  // CKeyExKerbApRep (SgToXb)     #define KEYEX_TYPE_PADDING      0x5886  // padding to make packet larger     WORD            _wType;                 // See KEYEX_TYPE_* above     WORD            _cbEnt;                 // Size of entry (including header) struct CKeyExXbToXb : public CKeyExHdr     WORD            _wVersion;          // KEYEX_VERSION     WORD            _wFlags;            // Reserved     XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier of key-exchange-key     DWORD           _dwSpiInit;         // SPI of the initiator     DWORD           _dwSpiResp;         // SPI of the responder     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];    // Nonce of the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceResp[8];    // Nonce of the responder     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;            // Increasing time-value of the sender     BYTE            _abIv[8];           // IV for DES encryption     XNADDR          _xnaddrInit;        // XNADDR of the initiator (encrypted)     XNADDR          _xnaddrResp;        // XNADDR of the responder (encrypted) The wVersion field specifies the key exchange version of the sender of the message.  For future compatibility, the sizes of these key exchange structures can be increased or new payloads can be inserted.  The receiver of such a message should check the version field to know what type of message the sender expects in return.  For example, if the sender is at version zero and the replier is at version one, the replier must respond to the sender with a version zero response that the sender would understand.  The wFlags field is for general bit flags.  There are none currently defined for the version zero of the key exchange protocol, so this field will be zero. The xnkid field specifies the XNKID of the game session that both the initiator and responder have each registered via XNetRegisterKey (along with the corresponding secret XNKEY). The dwSpiInit field is the SPI value assigned by the initiator for this security association.  The responder will place this value in the dwSpiAndFlags field of all XSP packets sent to the initiator.  The dwSpiResp field is the SPI value assigned by the responder for this security association.  The initiator will place this value in the dwSpiAndFlags field for all XSP packets sent to the responder.   The abNonceInit and abNonceResp fields are random nonces generated by the initiator and responder, respectively.  These are used to validate responses and as input for computing the inbound and outbound SHA and DES keys. The liTime field is a 64-bit time value that is used to limit replay attacks.  When the XNet stack is initialized, the number of 100ns periods since January 1, 1601 UTC is remembered (also known as the SYSTEMTIME).  Every time a key exchange packet it transmitted (or retransmitted for timeouts), this value is incremented by one unit (one 100ns period), and that time is transmitted in the key exchange packet.  Should the initiator or responder reboot and attempt to rejoin the same game session (because it reacquired the same XNKID / XNKEY pair from the game host via broadcast or from the matchmaking server when it came back up), its system time will have moved forward by many thousands if not millions of units.  The purpose of this scheme is to prevent the replay of key exchange initiator packets disrupting the security association between a pair of Xboxes.   The abIv field is a random initialization vector used to encrypt the next two fields, xnaddrInit and xnaddrResp.  These fields are encrypted using the 3DES key generated during the call to XNetRegisterKey.  The xnaddrInit field contains the XNADDR of the initiator of the key exchange, and the xnaddrResp field contains the XNADDR of the responder of the key exchange. The next payload in the key exchange message is of type KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX and contains 96 bytes of data (768 bits).  It contains the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation (g^X mod N) provided by the sender of the message. The final payload in the key exchange message is of type KEYEX_TYPE_HMAC_SHA and contains 20 bytes of data.  An HMAC-SHA hash of all payloads from the first to just before this last one is computed using the SHA key generated during the call to XNetRegisterKey. Key Exchange Message Flow The Xbox to Xbox key exchange consists of the initiator sending an initiator packet (KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_INIT), followed by the responder sending back a response packet (KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOXB_RESP), followed by the initiator sending a XSP data packet to prove to the responder that it has computed the negotiated keys correctly.  The XBTOXB_INIT message is sent by the initiator  while in state SR_STATE_INITSENT.  The XBTOXB_RESP message is sent by the responder while in the state SR_STATE_RESPSENT as a response to a XBTOXB_INIT message.  The XSP data packet is sent by the initiator while in the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT in response to a XBTOXB_RESP message. The initiator of the key exchange assigns a dwSpiInit value, generates a random abNonceInit, fills in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fills in the xnkid and xnaddrInit fields, and increments and sets the liTime field.  All other fields are zeroed.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the XNKID and sent to the responder. When this message is received, the responder will use the XNKID field to find the corresponding SHA key to authenticate this message.  The responder will then allocate and fill a new CSecReg structure, assign a dwSpiResp value, generate a random abNonceResp, fill in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fill in the xnkid and xnaddrResp fields, and increment and set the liTime field.  The dwSpiInit, abNonceInit, and xnaddrInit fields are copied from the initiator message.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the xnkid and sent to the initiator.  The responder at this time has enough data to compute the security association keys.  It takes the initiators g^Y value and using its own X value from the CKeyReg structure, computes g^XY.  It then computes five digests by calling HMAC-SHA with a concatenation of g^XY, abNonceInit, and abNonceResp as input, using the SHA key associated with the XNKID as the key.   For each digest beyond the first, the first byte of the g^XY value is incremented to make the resulting HMAC-SHA digest distinct from the previous.  These five digests are divided to make two SHA keys (16 bytes each), two 3DES keys (24 bytes each), and two initialization vectors (8 bytes each).  The 3DES keys have their parity set appropriately.  One set of SHA, 3DES, and IV is used for inbound traffic, and the other set of SHA, 3DES, and IV is used for outbound traffic. When the initiator receives the XBTOXB_RESP message, it performs the same computation to generate the security association keys.  The Xmit and Recv keys are swapped so that they match the ones calculated by the other side.  Once the initiator has these keys, it is free to transmit any packets that have been waiting for key exchange to complete.  The responder, however, is not free to do so even though it has the same set of keys because it cannot be sure that its XBTOXB_RESP message was not lost.  The responder will remain in the SR_STATE_RESPSENT until it receives a properly authenticated XSP packet from the initiator.  In the common case, the initiator has a packet it wishes to send to the other side, so the key exchange process will consist of just two messages.  Should the initiator not have a packet to send, it will send an artificial  pulse  message. When the initiator receives the XBTOXB_RESP message, it enters the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT.  It will remain in this state responding to XBTOXB_RESP messages with artificial  pulse  messages.  As soon as it receives a properly authenticated XSP it enters the SR_STATE_READY state and stops responding to any key exchange message from the other side except for a XBTOXB_INIT message, which signals the beginning of a new key exchange procedure. Key Exchange State Machine The following table describes the key exchange state machine.  Note that if both sides initiate key exchange at the same time, the one with the larger Ethernet address (binary comparison) will be chosen as the initiator and the other will become the responder.  Each side will have the Ethernet address of the other in the XNADDR to perform this calculation. ould use when they are connecting for a System Link session.  For two Xboxes that are logged on and connecting for an Online Peer session, there is a small difference in the data transmitted between the peers and in the key generation algorithm. The computation of g^XY takes 13 ms at 100% CPU on a 733 MHz processor, which is a significant amount of time and will causes a game to miss the rendering of a frame each time it happens.  For games that support  join in progress , this is a quite undesirable. To eliminate this overhead, two Xboxes connecting for an Online Peer session do not exchange Diffie-Hellman exponentials (there is no KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX payload), and the key derivation algorithm uses the concatenation of xnaddrInit, xnaddrResp, abNonceInit, and abNonceResp as the input HMAC-SHA to produce the five digests.   These modifications make Online Peer key exchange less secure than System Link key exchange.  However, the XNKID and XNKEY for online sessions were obtained from the matchmaking server over a security association established to a Security Gateway (described next).  Key exchange from an Xbox to a Security Gateway uses Diffie-Hellman and all traffic to and from the Security Gateway is 3DES encrypted with either 3DES for the main service or DES for game servers.. Xbox to Security Gateway Key Exchange Whenever an Xbox communicates to an Xbox Live server (such as matchmaking), or to a game server, it must first establish a security association with a Security Gateway that is fronting the server.  Xbox to Security Gateway key exchange is similar to System Link key exchange, except that the payloads transmitted in are KEYEX_TYPE_XBTOSG_INIT, KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX, and KEYEX_TYPE_KERB_APREQ.  The XBTOSG_INIT payload is shown below. struct CKeyExXbToSgInit : public CKeyExHdr     #define XSIF_CONNECTION_SERVICE     0x0001  // Request connection service     #define KEYEX_USER_GUEST_MASK         0x1F     #define KEYEX_USER_PERMUTE_MASK       0x20     #define KEYEX_USER_PERMUTATION_SHIFT     6     WORD            _wVersion;                  // KEYEX_VERSION     WORD            _wFlags;                    // See XSIF_* above     DWORD           _dwSpiInit;                 // SPI of the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];            // Nonce of the initiator     DWORD           _dwUserPerm;                // Permutation and guest bits struct CKeyExSgToXbResp : public CKeyExHdr     #define SXRF_ENCRYPT_DES        0x00000001  // SG wants DES encryption     #define SXRF_ENCRYPT_3DES       0x00000002  // SG wants 3DES encryption     WORD            _wVersion;                  // KEYEX_VERSION     WORD            _wFlags;                    // See SXRF_* above     DWORD           _dwSpiInit;                 // SPI of the initiator     DWORD           _dwSpiResp;                 // SPI of the responder     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];            // Nonce of the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceResp[8];            // Nonce of the responder     // From here down everything is encrypted using the negotiated 3DES key.

The dwUserPerm field is a four byte permutation vector describing how to rearrange the list of users encoded in the Kerberos AP request.   Following this payload is the KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX payload which contains the Diffie-Hellman g^X value from the initiator.   Following that is the KEYEX_TYPE_KERB_APREQ payload which contains a Kerberos AP request.  Encoded in the AP request is the HMAC-SHA hash of all of the payloads except this final one, computed using the Kerberos session key.  The AP request also contains a custom Xbox authentication structure with fields specifying the title the Xbox is running, the version of the client, the PUID of the Xbox machine account, the PUIDs of the set of users currently logged on to the Xbox, and a set of service identifiers specifying the types of servers in the datacenter the Xbox has been given permission to access.   If the Kerberos ticket is valid, the Security Gateway generates its own abNonceResp, a Diffie-Hellman X and g^X value, and assigns a dwSpiResp.  A single key exchange response packet is generated which starts with a payload of type KEYEX_TYPE_SGTOXB_RESP, followed by KEYEX_TYPE_DH_GX, followed by KEYEX_TYPE_KERB_APREP.  Notice that the Security Gateway can chose the cipher strength for encryption by specifying either the SXRF_ENCRYPT_DES or the SXRF_ENCRYPT_3DES flags in the dwFlags field of the first payload.  The Kerberos AP reply encodes the HMAC-SHA hash of all of the payloads except the final AP reply payload.  This allows the Xbox client to authenticate the key exchange response. Both sides generate keys by computing digests in the same way as described earlier for System Link key exchange.  Namely, g^XY is computed and then concatenated with abNonceInit and abNonceResp.  Five HMAC-SHA digests are computed, each time incrementing the first byte of g^XY to produce unique digests.  These digests are then split into the SHA, 3DES, and IV for both inbound and outbound traffic on the security association. Security Gateways A security gateway operates as a gateway between a public network (e.g., the Internet), and our private network (e.g., an internal data center network).  The security gateway allows secure communication channels to be established with game consoles via the public network, and allows secure communication between game consoles on the public network and service devices on the private network.  An Xbox console connects directly to a security gateway. The strength of encryption between an Xbox console and the security gateway can be up to is 168-bit 3DES for the main datacenter and 56-bit DES for game servers.  The strength of encryption between an Xbox console and another Xbox console is 56-bit DES.    EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Pre-shared Secret for Online Security When an Xbox console is manufactured, it is given a unique serial number and randomly generated 128-bit key (so-called  online key ).  The serial number and online key is copied into a database and is later used to prove to the system that the Xbox console is a valid Xbox console.  An attacker would have to know the serial number (which is in the clear) and online key (which is obfuscated on the hardware) in order to masquerade as that Xbox console. The online key is propagated to the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and is used to generate the machine account. The security of the Xbox Online system relies on several 128 bit symmetric keys being shared between the Xbox client and the KDC servers within our data center, and using the knowledge of these keys to mutually authenticate each other during the Machine Account Creation, User Sign On (first time for account creation) and User Sign In (subsequent times after the account has been created) processes. Machine and User Accounts Machine Account Creation The first time an Xbox console wants to connect to our online service, it must create a machine account in our service.  The Xbox console does this by connecting with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   A Kerberos AS request is used for this machine account creation process, and it requires a special encrypted Pre-Auth containing information about the newly created machine account in the AS reply. The server used in the process is referred to as the MACS (machine account creation server) KDC Server. Mutual authentication is performed on the client, so if the server does not know the pre-shared online key, it will not be able to make the client accept (and store) the new machine account. The serial number and online key pair is collected at all Xbox manufacturing sites and the online key is encrypted with a public key at the manufacturing site before being stored into a database which is then transported to the Xbox online data center. The corresponding private key is held in several nCipher devices that are used on the MACS servers during machine account creation. After a machine account is created, a regular Kerberos authentication cycle can be carried out to authenticate the Xbox machine account to the Xbox online system using the AS KDC and the TGS KDC (we will refer to the servers as the ASKDC and the XKDC). A ticket is finally granted to talk to an SG and a key exchange is performed with the SG (using the granted ticket) to establish a secure channel between the Xbox and the SG. After a machine account has been created, the Xbox console can generate User Accounts as described below. Machine Account Storage Account credentials for the machine account are stored on the hard drive and encrypted with the hard drive key. Machine accounts are stored in the configuration sectors of the hard drive before the file system header. Each account is represented by a structure that contains the Kerberos principal name and realm name along with the principal key. Each stored structure is HMAC signed with the hard drive key as follows: AccountStructSignature = SHA1-HMAC (HardDriveKey, EntireAccountStructure) And then the actual 16 byte principal key within the structure is encrypted using the hard drive key as follows: First4BytesOf3DESKey = First4bytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey1, HardDriveKey)) Last20BytesOf3DESKey = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey2, HardDriveKey) EncryptedPrincipalKey = E3DES (3DESKey, UnencryptedPrincipalKey) A triple DES key is first generated using 2 separate HMACs on the hard drive key using fixed (but randomly generated) keys as the HMAC key. Then a triple DES encryption in CBC mode (using a random IV) is performed on the principal key using the triple DES key. The entire account structure (containing the encrypted principal key) along with the first 8 bytes of the AccountStructSignature is stored on the configuration sectors of the hard drive. The decrypt process is the reverse of the encrypt process and at the end, the AccountStructSignature is used to verify whether the entire account structure is valid and unmodified. User Account Creation Using this secure channel by the machine account credentials (described above), the Xbox console can connect to the User Account Creation Service (UACS) behind the SG using the previously established SG secure channel. Within this secure channel, we send the users credit card information up to the UACS server, and a new set of user credentials (i.e. the user key) is sent down to the Xbox. All this traffic is triple DES encrypted between the Xbox and the SG via the secure channel. User Account Storage Account credentials for user accounts can be stored on the hard drive (up to 8 users) or on a Memory Unit (MU).  The memory unit can be carried by the user to another Xbox console and the user can Sign In at that location.  The user may also copy the user account from the MU to a hard drive (up to 8 users can store their credentials on the hard drive). When stored on a hard drive, the user account is stored in the same format as the machine account (see above). The process of storing a user account on an MU is slightly different due to the fact that the hard drive key cannot be used. In this case, a fixed key is used to encrypt and sign the account structure before storing it on an MU. Also, a fixed IV is used during the 3DES encryption. Neither the fixed key of the fixed IV can ever change due to the fact that user accounts stored on MUs must be able to roam onto different Xboxes using different games. We must assume these fixed keys will be discovered very soon and that whoever has physical possession of an MU can extract the raw user account key if desired. This is why machine account keys are considered more secure than user account keys, since they can never be stored on an MU. A user account alone cannot logon to the Xbox online system; it must be compounded with a valid machine account. User Account Sign In After the machine and user accounts have been created, the Xbox console uses the standard Kerberos protocol to retrieve a service ticket.  See references for details on Kerberos. At this point both a machine account and possibly several user accounts have been created, and a Kerberos authentication process using compound-identities can be performed to obtain a Kerberos ticket that proves authenticity of both the machine account and multiple user accounts. This ticket contains custom auth-data that enumerates the PUIDs (Passport Unique Identifier) of all the authenticated accounts. After a key exchange with the SG, the SG will associate this auth-data information with the secure channel and forward it to any backend services that request it. The goal of authentication has been achieved: We authenticate (verify knowledge of key) each and every Xbox identity that wishes to particulate in the online gaming session and we provide the backend services with a means to access the KDC verified identities. Xbox Kerberos Usage Encryption Notation In order to simplify the description of the way various messages and keys are computed, we will introduce the following notation: Digest = SHA1 (M) Digest is the 20 byte SHA1 hash of the message M. Digest = MD5 (M) Digest is the 16 byte MD5 hash of the message M. Digest = SHA1-HMAC (K, M) Digest is the 20 byte SHA1-HMAC (according to IETF RFC 2104) of the message M using the key K. Digest = MD5-HMAC (K, M) Digest is the 16 byte MD5-HMAC (according to IETF RFC 2104) of the message M using the key K. EncryptedMessage = EType (K, M) EncryptedMessage is the encrypted form of Message M using the key K to encrypt. The   of the encryption is usually DES, 3DES, or RC4-HMAC. Encryption Algorithms The only Kerberos encryption system the Xbox client will support is the  RC4-HMAC  crypto system. The only checksum system used is the MD5 checksum. All keys and checksums will be 16 bytes long. Only   are stored and used within our system. No  password  is ever generated and transformed into a Key. The client does not examine the encryption method used to encrypt the tickets; it is up to the various KDCs and Xbox services to determine the encryption system of the tickets. For now we are only using RC4-HMAC for ticket encryption also. Client Side Ticket Caching All Tickets and associated session keys retrieved from either KDC will be cached to the Xbox hard drive. This will make it unnecessary to contact either the AS KDC or the TGS KDC unless the required final tickets to talk to the security gateways have expired. We are doing this because the original machine and user keys used to obtain these tickets are stored on disk anyway, and anybody that could steal the session key associated with an expiring ticket could just as easily steal the original key for the machine or user account. This ticket caching scheme will greatly reduce the amount of traffic to both KDCs as well as decrease the logon latency. This is especially needed since (unlike a PC) people typically reboot their game console many times during a day. As an added security measure, we will be encrypting the ticket session keys before we store the session key on the hard drive. The session key will be encrypted with all the user keys that were used to obtain the corresponding ticket before we store the session key on the hard drive. This guarantees that a ticket cached by a visiting user on an MU will be useless once the MU has been removed. The encryption is done as follows: For every cached ticket we store its 16 byte session key encrypted along with a 20 byte digest of the unencrypted raw session key. We first compute an HMAC of the raw session key using a hard coded fixed key as the HMAC Key:  SessionKeyDigest = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey3, RawSessionKey) This SessionKeyDigest is also stored on the HD to verify the correctness of the raw session key later on. Then the session key is sequentially encrypted using each user s principal key along with the hard drive key. For each encryption, the following steps are performed: First4BytesOf3DESKey = First4BytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey4, EncryptionKey)) Last20BytesOf3DESKey = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey5, EncryptionKey) EncyptedSessionKey = E3DES (3DESKey, UnencryptedSessionKey) A triple DES key is first generated using 2 separate HMACs on the encryption key and then a triple DES encryption in CBC mode (using a fixed IV) is performed on the session key using the triple DES key. After repeating this step several times (once for each user key and finally once for the hard drive key) the final encrypted session key is computed and stored on the HD along with the ticket and the session key digest. The decrypt process is the reverse of the encrypt process and at the end, the session key digest is used to verify whether the decrypted session key matches the original session key. Whenever, a cache hit is encountered, but the cached ticket already has more than 50% of its lifetime expired. The client tries to obtain a fresh ticket from the KDC. If it fails however, it will continue to use the current cached ticket. We do this to make sure all clients have a semi-fresh ticket that can be used, should a catastrophic failure cause the KDCs to be down. Clock Synchronization Clock synchronization is dealt with in the normal Kerberos fashion. When the time in the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP is off by more than 5 minutes, the KDC reports Kerberos error number 0x25. The client then automatically corrects its UTC time with the supplied correct time in the error message, and retries again. Because the Xbox manages the time zone of the console, the effect the end user will observe is that the Xbox clock is automatically corrected every time the console goes online. We must make sure the clock time of the AS KDC and the TGS KDC as well as the time on the security gateways must all be relatively in sync. Ticket Lifetime The lifetime of the TGTs retrieved from the AS KDC will be set to 30 days. This long time period is justified because these TGTs are only used to obtain real tickets from the Xbox KDC, and that process will check for account lockouts and various other policy issues. Thus the 30 day limit will not permit banned users or machines from gaining unlimited access for 30 days. This longer ticket lifetime will also enable the client ticket cache to more drastically reduce the amount of AS KDC traffic. The lifetime the tickets issued by the Xbox TGS KDC will be a function of the service requested and the game title, but will typically be 36 hours. It was chosen to be 36 hours so that hard core gamers that play everyday will be able to survive an XKDC shutdown for a day without being affected. Ticket Renewal We will not support ticket renewal using the regular Kerberos ticket renewal process. Instead, in the rare case where a ticket has expired, the Xbox will simply request new tickets. The standard Kerberos ticket renewal mechanism is not used. Also the SG currently does not disconnect any secure channels based on the ticket expiration time. In other words, once an Xbox to SG connection is established using a non-expiring ticket, the connection can remain active for however long the user desires irregardless of the expiration time of the ticket. This problem will be corrected in the future. Returning Kerberos Errors Our KDCs have been modified to remain completely silent (no Kerberos Error message is replied) when we receive requests that are known to not come from a legitimate Xbox title. Examples of this include requests for the wrong realm and requests not containing the expected pre-auths. However, due to the possibility that a legitimate Xbox could logon with a user account that has been renamed or has a reset key, we must still respond with KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN and KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED errors when appropriate. Common Pre-Auths Used in All AS Requests Several new pre-auth types have been added to perform the extra tasks needed during Xbox logon. Most of these pre-auth structures are encrypted with the session key in the TGT if it is in a TGS request, otherwise they will be encrypted with the client key. A different encryption salt is used for each of these pre-auth structures. Most of these pre-auth structures are direct in memory structures with all multi-byte fields stored in little endian format. The following sections describe custom pre-auths that we have added in all of our AS requests. This includes both the AS request sent to the MACS server as well as the AS requests sent to the AS KDC. Client Version Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION        #define XONLINE_CLIENT_VERSION_SIGNATURE_SIZE          #define XONLINE_MAX_CLIENT_VERSION_SIZE               #define KRB5_PADATA_CLIENT_VERSION           132 #define KERB_KDC_REQ_NONCE_SALT        #define KERB_PA_CLIENT_VER_SALT              1027  #define XBOX_VERSION_STRING "Xbox Version=%s Title=0x%08X TitleVersion=%d" typedef struct _XKERB_PA_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION     BYTE abSignature[XONLINE_CLIENT_VERSION_SIGNATURE_SIZE];     char acVersionString[XONLINE_MAX_CLIENT_VERSION_SIZE]; } XKERB_PA_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION, *PXKERB_PA_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION;  #defile XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING "Xbox Version=%s Title=0x%X TitleVersion=%d" The Kerberos protocol does not provide a mechanism for the client to report a version number during an AS request. We decided to add a custom client version string as a pre-auth to let the server know the exact version of the client in case we need to make some KDC changes in the future that requires different actions based on the version of the client. The string is formatted using the format string XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING, and the entire null terminated string is encrypted copied into acVersionString in the XKERB_PA_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION structure. Thenusing NonceHMACKey and abSignature is computed as follows: TempKey = MD5-HMAC (PrincipalKey,  signaturekey SaltedNonce = MD5 (KERB_KDC_REQ_NONCE_SALT | NonceInKDCRequest) NonceHMACKey = MD5-HMAC (TempKey, SaltedNonce) EncryptedPreAuth abSignature = SHA1-HMACERC4-HMAC  (NonceHMACKey, FOFORMATTED_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING) The PrincipalKey is the Key of the authenticating principal, which could be either the Online Key, the machine account key, or the user account key, or the TGT session key depending on what the AS request is for, or whether it is a TGS request. The NonceInKDCRequest is the 4 byte nonce present in the KDC Request. Mixing the nonce into the key used to encrypt the string, helps avoid the problem of an attacker extracting a pre-auth from one KDC request and attaching it to another. The Pre-Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_PPA                204 #define XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE               20 #define XONLINE_PPA2_STORAGE_LENGTH         8 typedef struct _XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA     FILETIME currentTime;     BYTE ppa1[XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE];     BYTE sppa2atT[XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE]; } XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA, *PXKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA; One major problem we have in our KDC is the fact that when a principal comes to authenticate during an AS request, we need to perform an expensive database lookup to verify the existence of the principal and retrieve the corresponding key of the principal. As such, an attacker can easily launch a denial of service attack on our KDCs by simply sending massive amounts of AS requests for non existing (or existing) principals. Even though the KDC will eventually figure out that the principal does not exist or the client key is incorrect, the massive amount of queries to the database will already bring the entire system to a halt. The obvious solution to this problem is to maintain an in memory list of all the possible principals and it s corresponding key. However, due to the possible long size of principal names and the keys, this would require a lot of memory. Instead we decided to build a hash table that contains fewer bytes per entry, and can be used to verify the client s knowledge of a correct name/key pair without a database lookup. In order to support the use of this smaller sized lookup table, an additional pre-auth (appropriately named the  pre-pre-auth ) was added to each AS request. The details of this pre-pre-auth mechanism is described below. Whenever a new principal entry is added to the system, the following fields are computed:  PPA1 = SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName) SPPA1 = SHA1 (PPA1) PPA2 = First8bytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName | PrincipalName)) Besides storing the Principal Name and Principal Key in the database, we also store SPPA1 and PPA2. The KDC server upon startup reads all the rows for all the principal entries and builds up an in memory hash table containing the following 16 bytes in each entry: The first 4 bytes of SHA1 (PrincipalName) The first 4 bytes of SPPA1 All 8 bytes of PPA2 The first 8 of the above 16 bytes is used as the key to the hash table lookup and the remaining 8 byte PPA2 is used after the look up. If memory is tight, the 8 byte PPA2 data can be omitted. During auth time, the client builds the pre-pre-auth data structure (XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA) and sends it in the clear to the KDC. Inside the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure, the currentTime is filled in with the current time and PPA1 is also computed and filled in. Instead of directly including PPA2, SPPA2@T is computed and included in the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure: SPPA2@T = SHA1 (PPA2 | CurrentTime) The KDC server upon receiving an AS request with this pre-pre-auth, can easily compute SHA1 (PrincipalName) and SPPA1 and perform a hash table lookup to find the corresponding entry. If no such entry is found then the server performs a database lookup to load any new entries that have been added since the last time this query was performed. However, this database lookup is throttled to be called at most once every second, so that denial of service requests can only make us perform a database hit at most once a second. The downside to this is that any account that was just created will need to wait one second before sending out the initial AS request to authenticate. If the hash table entry is found, then PPA2 can be retrieved and SPPA2@T can be computed (using the time included in the pre-auth) and verified to match the value sent in. If the included time in the pre-pre-auth is not within a time skew of the current time, then a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error will need to be returned along with the correct current time. The whole PPA2 step can be omitted if memory is tight and only 8 bytes can be stored per entry. This extra pre-pre-auth enables us to build an in memory hash table that can be used to verify the requester s knowledge of a correct principal name and principal key pair. Once the requester is determined to be a certain principal, a secondary denial of service table can be built to deny requests from this particular principal, if too many requests are being made from that principal. The Echo Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_ECHO               205 As an added measure to combat distributed denial of service attacks we also added code into our client to perform the following logic: If a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW or KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED error is returned by the KDC and an extended error info is attached in the Kerberos Error message, then the AS request would be resent again, but this time it would include another echo pre-auth that simply echoes back the bytes received in the extended error info. The purpose of this echo pre-auth is to filter out requests coming from fake IP addresses. We can easily achieve this by attaching a signature blob in the extended error info that somehow embeds the IP address that the incoming request came from. By making the client echo this signature back to us in a subsequent request, we can filter out requests that are coming from bogus IP addresses that were never able to receive the error message containing the extended error info. We currently do not have code in our server to perform this echo request, but we can add that at a later time if the need arises. The important thing is to make sure that all of our released clients are capable of handling this echo request should the need ever arise.

For Xbox machine accounts, we need to make sure that it really is an Xbox attempting to create the account and not a PC pretending to be an Xbox. To prevent arbitrary computers from creating Xbox online accounts, we generate a random  online key  during Xbox manufacturing, and the Xbox serial number along with the online key will function as the pre-shared key between the Xbox and the MACS KDC during machine account creation. We will be using a Kerberos AS request cycle to the MACS KDC Server to perform the machine account creation. Xbox machine account creation is performed as follows: The Xbox does a DNS lookup on  macs.xboxlive.com  and opens a UDP socket to the MACS KDC at port 88. The Xbox sends a KRB_AS_REQ to the Xbox MACS KDC. The principal name used will be  NNNNNNNNNNNN  where the 12 N s are replaced with the 12 digit serial number ox the requesting Xbox. The standard PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth will be included, as well as the client version pre-auth and the pre-pre-auth. The online key will be used as the principal key to compute all these pre-auths. The MACS KDC will then perform the pre-pre-auth check and look up the online key for that particular Xbox serial number in the genealogy database. The MACS KDC then checks with the database to determine whether a new machine account needs to be created, whether the machine account already exists and a key reset should be performed, or whether the account is banned due to some policy. If the account is not banned, the online key is retrieved from the genealogy database and an nCipher device is used decode the public key encrypted online key back into its raw form. This raw online key is then used as the principal key to verify the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth. After the KDC verifies that the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP checks out alright, it either creates a new machine account or gathers information about the existing account and resets the machine account key. In either case, the PUID and the new Xbox key will be sent back to the database to record the account reset time and the PUID and key of the new/existing account. The MACS KDC then sends an AS reply back containing the PA-XBOX-ACCOUNT-CREATION pre-auth. This pre-auth is encrypted using the NonceHMACKey similar to the client version pre-auth. The TGT sent back in the reply is totally ignored and the pre-auth in the reply is decrypted to reveal the machine account information. The new machine account information is recorded in the Xbox hard drive, and if all goes well, the MACS KDC will never be contacted by this Xbox again. The key for the krbtgt/macs.xbox.com principal is randomly generated every time a request is made. This is to guarantee that the ticket issued could never be used to do anything. Policies Enforced Only the first request creates a new machine account, the remaining requests only reset the key for the Xbox machine account with that serial number. If any machine has already created an account, then only a key reset will be allowed. If any machine account is blocked or banned, then the MACS request will fail silently. AS KDC Exchange Details The purpose of the AS exchange is to authenticate each machine and user account and to obtain a compound cross realm ticket to krbtgt/xbox.com.  The AS KDC Exchange One AS exchange will occur for each and every user and machine account participating in the logon session. Xbox sends several sequential AS request for all the users attempting to logon to build up a TGT containing the compound identities of all the users. The target for this TGT is the krbtgt at the passport.net realm. All but the very first request will contain a PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth containing the previous TGT (Details of the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY can be found at http://teamsite/kerberos/Hailstorm/Passport%20Kerb.doc). If no users are logging on, this step is omitted. The Xbox sends a final AS request to the AS KDC using the machine account, and includes the TGT obtained in the previous step in the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth. The target of this request is a cross realm TGT to the  xbox.com  KDC. The returned TGT contains a PAC section with the PUID of the machine account and all the user accounts. The AS requests will be sent sequentially one after another. The PA-PAC-REQUEST-EX pre-auth will be included and the only PAC sections requested will be the PAC_CLIENT_IDENTITY and the PAC_COMPOUND_IDENTITY sections. The standard PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth will be included, as well as the client version pre-auth and the pre-pre-auth. Policies Enforced Principal keys must be verified. The PUID of the accounts must be accurately recorded into the PAC section of the returned TGT. Tickets issued will expire in 30 days.

The following steps are carried out: Xbox sends Xbox KDC (located at DNS name  tgs.xboxlive.com ) a TGS request using the combined TGT that contains all the account PUIDs in the PAC section. It requests TKTs to the security gateway for multiple Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth section is included in the request to specify the services requested. This pre-auth section is encrypted using NonceHMACKey similar to the client version pre-auth. Also contained in this pre-auth section is the list of user PUIDs currently participating in the logon. The Xbox KDC compares the PUIDs from the PAC section of the incoming TGT with the PUIDs in the pre-auth section, and applies appropriate policy checks. The following are placed into the auth-data section of the issued TKT: The PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth in the same order as they were in the pre-auth. Xbox client specific information contained in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth. The list of services that can be serviced using this TKT. The auth-data is signed using the pre-shared key for the destination SG site by applying an MD5HMAC operation on the XKERB_AD_XBOX portion of the auth data using the SG pre-shared key. The Xbox KDC then returns the ticket for the security gateway site to the Xbox client in the TGS reply. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section is included in the reply to specify which services are serviced at this site, as well as the IP address of the site and the port of each service that is supported. An HR value is returned for each requested service that reports whether the service can be accessed using the returned ticket or whether the service is at another site, or whether the access to the service is not allowed altogether. The Xbox client repeats steps 1 through 5 until it has TKTs to all the sites needed to provide all the requested services. Note that some services may be rejected due to policy checks on the Xbox KDC. The KDC will continue to issue tickets to granted services, even though some requested services are not granted. Policies Enforced The following paragraphs describe the policies that should be enforced by the Xbox TGS KDC when granting out tickets. First some general policies: Tickets granted should only be good for 36 hours, and should NOT be forwardable, proxiable, or renewable. Make sure we return the minimal number of site tickets to satisfy the requested services. When any of the following policies are violated, no ticket is issued and a Kerberos error is possibly returned: Normal Kerberos checks on the PA-TGS-REQUEST pre-auth to test if the session key is correct as well as the timestamp being within the allowed range, is applied. If no service is requested or if the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth is not included, the request is silently dropped. The Xbox KDC should make sure all PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST are authentic by checking them in the PAC of the TGT. Then the checked PUIDs should be copied into the auth-data of the ticket in the same order they were presented in the pre-auth. If any PUID in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST is missing from the PAC, the request is silently dropped. If the ticket issue date of the incoming TGT is before the last password reset date of any of the user/machine accounts, the entire request must be rejected with Kerberos error KDC_ERR_TGT_REVOKED. This will trigger the client to obtain a fresh TGT and try again. Xbox AP request/reply Details The Xbox client uses the TKTs obtained from the Xbox KDC to construct Kerberos AP-REQ and AP-REP messages that are used to perform mutual authenticate on the key exchange packets sent during setup of the security association between the Xbox and the security gateway. The IP address of the security gateways was obtained from the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section in the TGS reply from the Xbox KDC. The port for each service is used as the inner port sent through the SG tunnel to identify the destination service. The security gateways will retrieve the auth data sealed in the TKTs and forward the auth-data to any backend service that requests it. During the key exchange packets, the controller order of the users as well as information on which user is the guest of another user is also sent from the client to the SG. The SG will use this information to reorder/update the user info in the auth data to reflect the accurate controller order and guest status, so that all backend services can know this information. In order to ensure that the AP request used as part of the SG key exchange packet is not extracted and used within another key exchange packet. We use the  checksum  field within the Kerberos authenticator (contained within the Kerberos AP Request) to store the HMAC digest value of the remaining key exchange initiator packet. Similarly, in the AP reply, we use the  subkey  field to store an HMAC digest value of the remaining key exchange response packet. More details about this key exchange is covered in another document. Policies Enforced Make sure the TKT is valid for the site being hit. Make sure the TKT has not expired. Make sure the time stamp in the authenticator is within the time skew. Make sure the AP-request is not a replay request of a previously seen request with the exact same authenticator timestamp from the Xbox with that exact same PUID. Make sure client is only getting access to services that it was allowed in the auth-data of the TKT. Voice support Players are able to communicate by speaking into a voice headset peripheral called the Xbox Communicator.  Voice traffic is not encrypted (but it is signed to prevent tampering).   In order for game developers to specify which traffic contains voice, a new protocol, IPPROTO_VDP, has been added to the XSNL implementation of WinSock.  To use this protocol, a title creates a socket as follows:  SOCKET s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_VDP); In most repects, this socket behaves exactly like a UDP socket, except that messages sent or received on this socket must be in the format: [cbGameData][GameData][VoiceData] Where [cbGameData] is a two-byte integer in Intel byte order that specifies the number of bytes of game data immediately following in the [GameData] part of the message.  The remainder of the message [VoiceData] contains voice the title chooses to transmit along with the game data.  Note that it is acceptable to specify zero bytes of [GameData] and/or zero bytes of [VoiceData].  A properly formatted message will always be at least two bytes long (enough to hold the [cbGameData]).  A message whose first two bytes specify more data than is in the entire message is invalid and will not be transmitted. On the wire, only the [GameData] portion of the message will be encrypted (with padding).  The [VoiceData] portion will be transmitted in the clear. On the other side, a title must receive incoming VDP packets on a socket created to send and receive IPPROTO_VDP.  That is, messages of type VDP only arrive on sockets having the same protocol.  It is an error to attempt to bind both a UDP socket and a VDP socket to the same inbound port.  You will get WSAEADDRINUSE if you try to do this. The security gateway code has been modified to support VDP packets as well.  In this case, a given Server specification can have a "Protocol" option whose value is "VDP".  Such an inbound port specification will cause the security gateway to reject any packets sent to that port if they are not of type VDP.  The security gateway will decrypt the packet and construct a normal UDP packet contain a message in the above format and send it along to the target server on the configured destination port. Responses from the server originating from the server specification's IP:port address will be interpreted as having the format [cbGameData]]GameData][VoiceData], and the security gateway will encrypt just the [GameData] portion on the wire. A game server needs to be prepared to accept UDP messages in this format, and must reply in the same format, for all such ports configured with "Protocol VDP".  Any Server specification which does not specify "Protocol VDP" will allow TCP and/or UDP traffic to flow, as is the case today, but will block inbound VDP traffic. Random Number generation For the purpose of generating random keys, nonces, initialization vectors, and DH exponents, the Xbox Secure Networking Library uses the following algorithm.  At XNet initialization time, we gather randomness from the disk, memory, and EEPROM values of the Xbox.  We fill a vector of bytes with values such as the tick count, system time, performance counter, system memory status, hard disk free space, and hard disk model and serial number.  Then we read a special sector on the hard disk (sector 8, also known as the first config sector) that is reserved for the random number generator.  The sector contains a 20-byte digest that we add to the vector of bytes we are generating.  We perform a SHA-1 hash of all of these bytes to generate a 20-byte digest.  This digest is used to initialize an RC4 machine.  The RC4 machine is then used to generate a new 20-byte digest, and this digest is written to the sector on the hard disk for use the next time the network stack is initialized.  To generate random numbers, we simply run the RC4 machine as much as necessary to produce the number of bytes requested.

I ve been meaning to do it myself for a while, but it keeps slipping. Do you have time to take a stab at it? My concern is that as home gateways move from basic NAT to more sophisticated firewalling, some may require uPnP signaling to work through non-standard ports (i.e. anything other than http, telnet, ftp). Alexander Popov is probably a good place to start for info. I believe he s the one who s been lobbying NAT vendors to support uPnP. Write the  Kerberos plan Xbox Key Exchange Author: Tony Chen, Dinarte Morais Introduction In an effort to deter cheating, retasking, mapping, denial of service, and other forms of malicious attacks on the Xbox through the Ethernet port, all Xbox to Xbox and Xbox to server communication will use the IPSec ESP format to authenticate and optionally encrypt the contents of each packet.  The purpose of this document is to describe the layout of each packet type transmitted by an Xbox, the algorithms used to secure these packets, the state machine run by each endpoint, as well as the specific encryption, authentication, and transformations performed to the data and keys, including how each type of key is generated. For now this document will concentrate solely on System Link Play, which is defined as two or more Xboxes connected via an Ethernet cross cable, or via an Ethernet bridge.  It is assumed that all such Xboxes can be reached via Ethernet broadcast, and that these Xboxes will only communicate with other Xboxes and not with any sort of server, including DHCP or DNS servers, or routers.  Future versions of this document will describe Online Play, which will make use of all of these services. Random Number Generation For the purpose of generating random keys, nonces, initialization vectors, and DH exponents, the Xbox Secure Networking Library uses the following algorithm.  At XNet initialization time, we gather randomness from the disk, memory, and EEPROM values of the Xbox.  We fill a vector of bytes with values such as the tick count, system time, performance counter, system memory status, hard disk free space, and hard disk model and serial number.  Then we read a special sector on the hard disk (sector 8, also known as the first config sector) that is reserved for the random number generator.  The sector contains a 20-byte digest that we add to the vector of bytes we are generating.  We perform a SHA-1 hash of all of these bytes to generate a 20-byte digest.  This digest is used to initialize an RC4 machine.  The RC4 machine is then used to generate a new 20-byte digest, and this digest is written to the sector on the hard disk for use the next time the network stack is initialized.  To generate random numbers, we simply run the RC4 machine as much as necessary to produce the number of bytes requested.  Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) When we talk about sending and receiving packets, we mean packets that are formatted in conformance with RFC 2406 with a slight twist.  The RFC defines an IP packet that has been transformed into an ESP packet having the ESP header immediately following the IP header.  In our case, we insert a UDP header just before the ESP header.  The format of a secure ESPUDP packet is shown below. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IP] |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                        Source Address                         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                     Destination Address                       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESP] |                 Security Parameters Index (SPI)               | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  |                        Sequence Number                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IV] |                Encryption Initialization Vector               | |           (Added only if packet is being encrypted)           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [Payload] ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESPT] ~       Padding (variable)      |  Pad Length   |  Next Header  | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                Authentication Data (12-bytes)                 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ The format of a secure TCP packet will be the same except that the second [UDP] header will be a [TCP] header.  Note that the initialization vector is only added to a packet that is encrypted.  The encrypted portion of the packet begins just after the initialization vector and ends just before the Authentication Data. Whether the packet is encrypted or not, it will always end with 12-bytes of Authentication Data, which is the first 12-bytes of the digest produced by performing a keyed HMAC-SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet starting at [ESP] and ending just before the Authentication Data.  If the packet is encrypted, encryption occurs first, then the encrypted contents are hashed. An important point to keep in mind from a security perspective is that the [IP] header and the outer [UDP] header are neither authenticated nor encrypted.  We must therefore assume that any or all of these fields can be spoofed by the sender, or modified in transit. The reason for adding the outer [UDP] header is to force all packets to use exactly one UDP source port no matter how many actual source ports the title uses.  This is an important consideration for future online play when communicating through Network Address Translators (NAT).  For System Link Play it is of little value, but since we will need this header in the near future, we decided to standardize the packet format now with this requirement. System Link Shared Secret Each title that is certified to play on an Xbox contains a unique randomly generated title key that can be found in the encrypted portion of the XBE (Xbox executable) certificate.   This key is the same for every copy of the same title, but is different on different titles, and is 16-bytes long.  We assume that the XBE certificate is somewhat difficult to read because the DVD format of an Xbox game is not readable with today s DVD drives, but it is certainly readable with any Xbox development kit, and no doubt will be easily readable in the future.  We cannot assume that the title key in the certificate will remain secret, therefore, since the certificate itself can be decrypted with a public key that exists in the ROM and will no doubt be widely available soon enough. In order to bootstrap the key exchange process, we need to come up with a shared secret that only an Xbox running a given title will know.  This shared secret will be used to authenticate the Xbox to another Xbox and to encrypt broadcast traffic between these Xboxes during the host discovery phase before key exchange has taken place.   This shared secret is computed by in two phases.  The XBE loader does the first phase by computing an HMAC-SHA-1 operation on the 16-byte key found in the XBE certificate using a key stored in the ROM.  We call this key the LAN key.  When the network stack is initialized, we perform two HMAC-SHA-1 operations on constant 16-byte strings using this LAN key to produce two 20-byte digests.  The first 16-bytes of the digests is used as the title broadcast SHA key, and the remaining 24-bytes is used as the title broadcast 3DES key.  This 3DES key will have its parity bits set correctly. The process of generating the title broadcast keys is done once at XNet initialization time.  All Xboxes running the same title will generate the same pair of keys.  Any Xbox running a different title on the same network will have a different pair of keys.   We presume that it is somewhat difficult for a non-Xbox to figure out what these keys are.  Due to their fixed nature, however, it only needs to be discovered once and then the title broadcast keys are compromised forever for that particular title.  XNKID and XNKEY There may be more than one Xbox hosting a game session at any given time.  While this is unlikely when there are only a handful of Xboxes connected on a small local network, in the future the number of available game sessions will be quite large, and a dedicated matchmaking service will be responsible for finding a suitable match. We distinguish between different sessions by defining an XNKID, or XNet Key Identifier, and an XNKEY, or XNet Key Exchange Key.  The XNKID is simply a name for the XNKEY.  The format of these data structures is shown below. typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[8];                      // key identifier } XNKID; typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[16];                     // key exchange key } XNKEY; A title which is hosting a game session generates an XNKID / XNKEY pair by calling the function XNetCreateKey.  This implementation of this function simply runs the random number generator to fill in both structures. A pair of Xboxes that want to communicate will have to obtain the same XNKID / XNKEY pairs (we describe how below) and each must call XNetRegisterKey with these values.  Once registered, you can think of the Xbox as listening for incoming key-exchange requests from other Xboxes on this XNKID.  Once a game session is finished, the title calls XNetUnregisterKey to stop accepting key-exchange requests from any Xbox using this XNKID / XNKEY pair.  The duration of a XNKID / XNKEY pair will be anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours at most. The XNKEY part of the pair is used to authenticate the contents of key exchange packets (described below).  The XNKID is carried in the payload of the key exchange packet to specify which game session the source Xbox is connecting to, and the corresponding XNKEY is used to compute a SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet.  If the target Xbox has registered the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, it will have an entry in its table of registered keys and will therefore be able to compute the same SHA-1 hash to authenticate the packet. The actual key used for key-exchange packet authentication is not the XNKEY directly.  When the title calls XNetRegisterKey with the XNKID and XNKEY, we compute a SHA key by performing a keyed HMAC operation on the XNKID and XNKEY using the title broadcast SHA key as the key.  The reason for this is that both the XNKID and XNKEY will be transmitted (presumably encrypted) between hosts somehow.  Should the XNKEY be discovered, most likely because a title developer forgot to read the part of the Technical Certification Requirements document making it clear that an XNKEY must never be transmitted unencrypted, the key used to authenticate key-exchange packets is still somewhat protected because the observer would also have to figure out the title broadcast SHA key for the particular title. XNADDR The Xbox Secure Networking Library extends the notion of a network address from a simple four-byte IP address to a structure of type XNADDR.  The format of an XNADDR is shown below. typedef struct {     BYTE        bSizeOfStruct;              // sizeof(XNADDR)     BYTE        bFlags;                     // XNET_XNADDR_* flags below     BYTE        abEnet[6];                  // Ethernet MAC address of the host     IN_ADDR     ina;                        // IP address of the host } XNADDR; #define XNET_XNADDR_RESERVED        0xFF    // No flags currently defined The size of this structure will be increased in the future for Online Play.  In addition to all the fields it currently has, it will also include the IP address and Port assigned by a NAT that is between the host and the Internet (if any), the IP address and Port assigned by the Connection Server that the Xbox is connected to (details of Connection Servers is beyond the scope of this document), and potentially other IP addresses to be determined. The reason for this level of abstraction is because the IP address of an Xbox, especially one that is behind a NAT, is not enough to establish connectivity.   Many different Xboxes could be configured with the same IP address 10.0.0.1, for example, yet each has a unique external IP address assigned by the NAT.  In the case of System Link Play, an Xbox will not even have an IP address at all.  It will only have an Ethernet MAC address.  This address is also carried in the XNADDR structure.  Besides being useful for addressing Ethernet frames, it is also a useful unique identifier of the Xbox that we will use in the key exchange state machine described later. For security reasons, we would like to keep the contents of an XNADDR hidden from the casual observer since it contains addressing information that would be useful to a hacker, so any packet that contains one or more of these structures must be encrypted.  Just because an XNADDR is transmitted to an Xbox doesn t mean that the Xbox will establish communication with that address.  It might have gotten a whole list of XNADDR to different potential game hosts and will only end up picking one.  While there is no way to prevent the hacker from seeing which IP address is being used by examining the IP packets, we don t want to give the hacker any more information about other Xbox addresses than is absolutely necessary. System Link Broadcast After a title initializes XNet, the next step is to discover if there are any other Xboxes running the same title that are hosting a game session.  Because there is no third-party matchmaking service available in System Link Play, the title must use Ethernet broadcast to perform this discovery. The discovery process involves a game host calling XNetCreateKey to generate a unique XNKID / XNKEY pair, calling XNetRegisterKey, opening a UDP socket and listening for discovery broadcasts from one or more clients.  The response to the discovery broadcast is a response packet (also transmitted via broadcast) which contains (at a minimum) the XNKID / XNKEY pair as well as the XNADDR of the game host.  When the client receives the response, it calls XNetRegisterKey with the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, and then calls XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR into an IP address that can be used like to communicate with the host. Because these discovery packets contain XNKEY and XNADDR structures, they must be encrypted.  The XNet stack automatically encrypts and authenticates any packet sent via broadcast by using the title broadcast SHA key and title broadcast 3DES key described earlier.  Using this discovery process, a game client can discover the list of game hosts available on the network and can choose which it wishes to communicate with by calling XNetRegisterKey with the XNKID / XNKEY pair of the chosen host.  All other XNKID / XNKEY pairs should be discarded.  Key Exchange After game session discovery we now have two Xboxes that share a title broadcast SHA key, a title broadcast 3DES key, as well as a XNKID / XNKEY pair.  Each Xbox has called XNetRegisterKey with its XNKID / XNKEY pair, and the game client has called XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR of the game host into an IP address. For the purpose of key exchange, let us consider the game client to be the initiator or the key exchange, and the game host to be the responder.  When the game client sends the first packet to the IP address obtained by the call to XNetXnAddrToInAddr, the XNet stack notices that there is no security association established between the game client and game host.  This means that there are no SHA or DES keys that are required to compute the authentication hash and optionally to encrypt the packet.  The packet is placed on a packet queue and the key exchange process is started. When XNetRegisterKey is called with an XNKID / XNKEY pair, a CKeyReg structure is allocated and filled.     struct CKeyReg     {         XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier         BYTE            _abKeySha[16];      // key exchange SHA auth key         BYTE            _abDhX[CBDHLEN];    // diffie-hellman X value         BYTE            _abDhGX[CBDHLEN];   // diffie-hellman g^X value     }; In addition to remembering the XNKID, it also holds the computed SHA key exchange key (which is different than XNKEY as described earlier).  Further, it is at this time that the Diffie-Hellman X value is randomly generated and the g^X value is computed.  The client will use the same X and g^X values for every key-exchange peer that mentions this XNKID.  When XNetXnAddrToInAddr is called with an XNADDR and a XNKID, a CSecReg structure is allocated and filled. struct CSecReg     DWORD           _dwSpiRecv;         // SPI assigned by this side     DWORD           _dwSpiXmit;         // SPI assigned by other side     DWORD           _dwSeqXmit;         // Highest sequence number transmitted     DWORD           _dwSeqRecv;         // Base sequence of receive window     DWORD           _dwSeqMask;         // Bit mask of sequence numbers received     BYTE            _bState;            // Connection state     BYTE            _bRetry;            // Number of retries remaining     BYTE            _bUnused[2];        // Unused     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;            // Highest time value from destination     CPacketQueue    _pqWait;            // Queue of packets waiting      CTimer          _timer;             // Timer for scheduling timeouts     BYTE            _abNonce[8];        // Nonce generated by this side     BYTE            _abIv[8];           // Next IV to use for encrypted packets     BYTE            _abKeyShaRecv[16];  // Negotiated incoming SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyShaXmit[16];  // Negotiated outgoing SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyDesRecv[8];   // Negotiated incoming DES crypt key     BYTE            _abKeyDesXmit[8];   // Negotiated outgoing DES crypt key     CKeyReg *       _pkeyreg;           // Pointer to corresponding CKeyReg     XNADDR          _xnaddr;            // XNADDR of the destination #define SR_STATE_IDLE           0       // key exchange not started  #define SR_STATE_INITSENT       1       // initiator packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_RESPSENT       2       // response packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_INITWAIT       3       // initiator waiting for responder #define SR_STATE_READY          4       // key exchange is complete This structure describes a security association between this host and the host with the given XNADDR.  There will be one security association for every unique XNADDR / XNKID pair.  We use the Ethernet address in the XNADDR structure to determine unique address, as it remains fixed to the Xbox whereas the IP address can be reassigned. A key-exchange packet is a UDP packet whose payload contains the following data. struct CKeyExMsg     DWORD           _dwSpiZero;         // Must be zero     DWORD           _dwSpiInit;         // SPI of the initiator     DWORD           _dwSpiResp;         // SPI of the responder     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];    // Nonce of the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceResp[8];    // Nonce of the responder     BYTE            _abDhGX[CBDHLEN];   // diffie-hellman g^X (or g^Y)     XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier     XNADDR          _xnaddr;            // XNADDR of the sender of this message     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;            // increasing time-value of the sender     BYTE            _abHash[12];        // HMAC-SHA-1-96 digest of CKeyExMsg The dwSpiZero field must be zero to distinguish this message from a standard ESPUDP message.  The first field of an ESP header is the SPI value that can never be zero.  If it is zero, then we know this is a key exchange message.  The dwSpiInit field is the SPI value assigned by the initiator for this security association.  The responder will place this value in the SPI field of all packets sent to the initiator.  The dwSpiResp field is the SPI value assigned by the responder for this security association.  The initiator will place this value in the SPI field for all packets sent to the responder.  The abNonceInit and abNonceResp fields are random nonces created by the initiator and responder, respectively.  These are used to validate responses and when computing the actual SHA and DES keys.   The g^X field is the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation provided by the sender of the message.  The XNKID field specifies the key identifier that both the initiator and responder should have obtained out-of-band and registered.  The XNADDR field contains the complete addressing information of the sender of the message.   The liTime field is a 64-bit time value that is used to limit replay attacks.  When the XNet stack is initialized, the number of 100ns periods since January 1, 1601 UTC is remembered (also known as the SYSTEMTIME).  Every time a key exchange packet it transmitted (or retransmitted for timeouts), this value is incremented by one unit (one 100ns period), and that time is transmitted in the key exchange packet.  Should the initiator or responder reboot and attempt to rejoin the same game session (because it reacquired the same XNKID / XNKEY pair from the game host via broadcast when it came back up), its system time will have moved forward by many thousands if not millions of units.  The purpose of this scheme is to prevent the replay of key exchange initiator packets disrupting the security association between a pair of Xboxes.   Finally, the abHash field contains the HMAC-SHA-1-96 digest of the entire message using the SHA key associated with the given XNKID. There are three distinct forms of this message: KeyExInit, KeyExResp, and KeyExAck.  The KeyExInit message is sent by the initiator while in state SR_STATE_INITSENT.  The KeyExResp message is sent by the responder while in the state SR_STATE_RESPSENT as a response to a KeyExInit message.  The KeyExAck message is sent by the initiator while in the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT in response to a KeyExResp message. The initiator of the key exchange assigns a dwSpiInit value, generates a random abNonceInit, fills in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fills in the XNKID and XNADDR fields, and increments and sets the liTime field.  All other fields are zeroed.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the XNKID and sent to the responder. KeyExInit: [dwSpiInit, 0, abNonceInit, 0, g^X, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] When this message is received, the responder will use the XNKID field to find the corresponding SHA key to authenticate this message.  The responder will then allocate and fill a new CSecReg structure, assign a dwSpiResp value, generate a random abNonceResp, fill in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fill in the XNKID and XNADDR field, and increment and set the liTime field.  The dwSpiInit and abNonceInit fields are copied from the initiator message.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the XNKID and sent to the initiator.  KeyExResp: [dwSpiInit, dwSpiResp, abNonceInit, abNonceResp, g^X, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] The responder at this time has enough data to compute the security association keys.  It takes the initiators g^Y value and using its own X value from the CKeyReg structure, computes g^XY.  It then computes four digests by calling HMAC-SHA with a single byte value (0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, for the respective digests), abNonceInit , abNonceResp, and g^XY as input, using the SHA key associated with the XNKID as the key.   The first 16 (SHA) or 8 (DES) bytes of these digests are copied into abKeyShaXmit, abKeyDesXmit, abKeyShaRecv, and abKeyDesRecv, respectively.  The DES keys have their parity set appropriately. When the initiator receives the KeyExResp message, it performs the same computation to generate the security association keys.  The Xmit and Recv keys are swapped so that they match the ones calculated by the other side.   Once the initiator has these keys, it is free to transmit any packets that have been waiting for key exchange to complete.  The responder, however, is not free to do so even though it has the same set of keys because it cannot be sure that its KeyExResp message was not lost.  The responder will remain in the SR_STATE_RESPSENT until it either receives a KeyExAck message or until it receives an ESPUDP packet authenticated with the computed SHA key.  In the common case, the initiator has a packet it wishes to send to the other side, so the key exchange process will consist of just two messages.  Should the initiator not have a packet to send, it will send an artificial KeyExAck message.  This message differs from the two other key exchange messages in that the message is hashed using the computed SHA key (abKeyShaXmit) of the security association instead of the SHA key associated with the XNKID.  This message is distinguished by having a zero dwSpiInit and a non-zero dwSpiResp. KeyExAck: [0, dwSpiResp, 0, 0, 0, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] When the initiator receives the KeyExResp message, it enters the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT.  It will remain in this state responding to KeyExResp messages with KeyExAck messages.  As soon as it receives an ESPUDP packet authenticated with the computed SHA key it enters the SR_STATE_READY state and stops responding to any key exchange message except for KeyExInit. The following table describes the key exchange state machine.  Note that if both sides initiate key exchange at the same time, the one with the larger Ethernet address will be chosen as the initiator and the other will become t ssuming 100% CPU utilization, and at the time we receive the key exchange packet the system is running at DPC level, which means that all user threads are suspended until the computation completes. If we try to chunk this operation into smaller pieces, we would first need an algorithm that would let us do it, or we could compute g^X as (g^X1^X2^X3^X4), with smaller X1   X4 values.  But the total amount of time needed will be the same (or slightly greater).  Further, the state machine for key exchange would become more complicated because there will be a state between INITSENT and INITWAIT during which the key computation is being performed.  Packets will have to be queued waiting for it to complete.  Should the initiator complete its asynchronous computation ahead of the responder and beings transmitting packets using the newly computed SHA and DES keys, the responder will be forced to either synchronously finish the computation of the keys as soon as it receives the packet, or it will have to enqueue a copy of these packets on a queue for later processing once the asynchronous key computation is complete.  It d like to avoid this type of complexity. The question is, what is the smallest modulus we can get away with?  I would like one that is large enough to prevent an observer from being able to compute the keys in real time.  Given that these Xbox to Xbox keys will only be used from as little as 10 minutes to at most several hours, we only need a modulus that prevents someone from brute forcing the exponentiation computation that long.  Will 256-bits do the trick?  How about 512-bits?

Security is the foundation of our network architecture and it is important that everyone understand our system to the appropriate depth in order to gauge the impact network security has on their feature of service. Readers of this section will have a basic understanding of these areas without having a prior background in network security.  The rest of this section describes the network security architecture in plain English.  The   HYPERLINK  \l "_Design"  Design  section will go into each area in more detail. Manufacturing and the unique online key Xbox network security starts at the manufacturing plant.  A unique online key is created for each Xbox and stored in the EEPROM and into and into a genealogy database.  Care is taken to ensure that this key is not exposed in the clear and that the generation of this key requires physical access to the secure factory machines.  The data from the manufacturing genealogy database is send to Redmond where the machine account creation fields are copied to our Machine Account Creation Database.  The genealogy database schema is documented in the Genealogy Database document.  The compromise of the unique online key is discussed in the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Key_Management_and_Exchange"  key management portion of the threat model Secure machine and user account creation When an Xbox comes online for the first time through the updated Xbox Dashboard, it will connect to the Machine Account Creation Servers to create an account specific to that Xbox.  To guard against   HYPERLINK  \l "_Denial_of_Service_from Account Crea"  denial of service  attacks against our machine account creation servers, these servers will quickly determine both if the credentials are properly created and that they are not being replayed before allocating any resources and accessing the credentials against the Machine Account Creation Database.  Once the machine account credentials have been validated, the Machine Account Creation Database is updated to reflect that this machine already has an account and subsequent requests to create a machine account with these credentials will be rejected and   HYPERLINK  \l "_Errors_and_Alerts"  alerted  upon suspicious activity. Upon validation of the machine credentials, a Passport account is created for the machine through a delegated administration function and the information and strong password is sent down encrypted with the unique online key.  The Passport machine account information and strong password is encrypted with the hard drive key and stored on the hard drive.  The Passport account will be used from then on to authenticate the machine.  The unique online key will not be used again after Passport machine account creation.   In addition to the machine account, any new users who sign up to the online service through the dashboard are also given an account through the delegated administrator function of Passport.  A strong password is created and stored on the hard drive for each user.  Users do not have access to this password as it is not meant to be  typed in .  These user credentials can be put onto a Memory Unit (MU) to allow the user to roam and still have online access.  The account can, however, be protected by a PIN that can be entered from the game controller.  The PIN is only used to prevent access to the account by other people who have access to that Xbox.  No confidential information is protected by the PIN.  More about account policies can be found in the Policy document.  Once the machine and user accounts have been created, the machine and users can be authenticated via Kerberos.   Kerberos authentication with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) When the title starts the process to connect to the Xbox Online Service, the machine and user credentials for the users that are  logged on  to the console are sent to the Passport Key Distribution Center (KDC).  The KDC authenticates the machine and users (each called a principle) by validating their passwords stored on the Xbox and returns a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) to the Xbox for each principle.  These TGTs have a relatively long validity period and are cached locally on the hard drive and will be presented to the Xbox Ticket Granting Server (TGS) to receive future, short-lived service tickets that are specific to the Xbox services (matchmaking, content download, etc.)  A server is the physical machine or set of machines that host that service. At this point, the principles are authenticated, but not authorized to access any service.  Kerberos authentication only states that this machine and its users are who they say they are and have a valid account with Passport.  Future authorization determines what services or features the users have access to.  Account Authorization by the Xbox Ticket Granting Server (TGS) In order to gain access to Xbox online functionality and services a title must have a service ticket.  The Xbox presents the title information and ticket granting tickets for each of its principles to the Xbox Ticket Granting Server.   The Xbox TGS checks the validity of the credentials for proper authentication, checks the billing system for account status, and returns a service tickets that contain the credentials for the machine and each authorized user.  The service ticket will be used later to create the secure connection between the Xbox and service and to authorize the users  access to that service. Xbox to server Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Key management and exchange are extremely important as the only thing worse than using cryptographically weak keys is establishing a secure connection with an adversary.  To establish a secure connection to a service, session keys must me exchanged in a secure way.  Xbox uses the standard Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol to bootstrap authorization, key exchange and the secure exchange of information.  Each side of a secure channel has a security association (SA).  Security associations serve as a contract between two or more entities, with all the participants agreeing on a suite of security protocol, protocol modes, authentication mechanisms, cryptographic algorithms, initialization vectors and keying material.    The IKE protocol has two phases to create secure channels of communication.  IKE Phase I creates a security association valid for the entire time of connection that controls further communication between Xbox and server.  During phase I, the Xbox presents the service ticket to the server.  The server validates the ticket and uses a key contained in the ticket to create the session ticket to the client.  IKE Phase II creates the security association or set of security associations for sending and receiving data in an authenticated and optionally secure way.  The division of the IKE phases has higher initial overhead, but this cost is amortized as the short-lived phase II connections are created, updated and destroyed more easily without having to start over. IKE is only used for the initial connection between the Xbox and server.  The Matchmaking Server for Xbox-to-Xbox games will communicate the session key to the joining Xbox.  The key exchange for system link play is described   HYPERLINK  \l "_Security_for_system_link play"  below Service authorization of principles When a connection is established, the application-level process can access the service ticket and perform application-level authorization and other actions based on the principles and other data in the authorization portion of the ticket.  This gives fine-grain authorization capabilities that can be controlled by either the TGS or the game server.  Once the connection has been established and authorized, future data can then be transmitted by a secure form of IP traffic called IPSec. NAT-Friendly secure IP connection (IPSec) An IPSec connection enables network packets to be validated by a signature to prevent   HYPERLINK  \l "_Tampering_with_Data"  tampering  and optionally encrypted to prevent   HYPERLINK  \l "_Information_Disclosure"  information disclosure .   Network Address Translation (NAT) devices are commonly found in DSL or Cable modems as a way to limit the amount of IP addresses that an ISP must provide.  IPSec, as designed, does not work through many NATs as they do not support the special security information that is inserted into the packet.  The Windows IPSec team has proposed an extension of the IPSec protocol to insert a UDP header after the IP header to allow the address-port translation that occurs in transit between the Xbox and ISP.  The current proposed extension has not been ratified by the IETF and may change.  The IPSec team has committed to supporting changes that they make in such an event.   Security for system link play Since there is no trusted server to authenticate peers, there is a shared secret key embedded into each title that is only shared between titles.  To search for game sessions to join on the same subnet, the client broadcasts an encrypted query containing a nonce.  Any available hosts of sessions that receive the broadcast query will broadcast an encrypted reply containing the query nonce, host session and connect information.   The client verifies the nonce and then uses the host session and connection information to bring up a secure connection to the host.  A pair-wise key for that connection is established for the length of the gaming session.  The threat model for system link play is discussed   HYPERLINK  \l "_LAN_Key_and_session key exchange fo"  below Architecture Diagram Figure 3.1: Network Security Architecture Design The network security system can be decomposed into several stages and then broken down into client and server-side components for each stage. Machine Account Creation In order to create an authenticated machine account, a key unique to each Xbox must be created at manufacturing time and known to the online service.  A secret key that is shared between a client and server before negotiating authentication credentials prevents several   HYPERLINK  \l "_Unique_Online_Key"  well-known attacks .  The unique online key is used to authenticate an Xbox upon the first time that a user connects to the service.   The system for the management of this key is described in detail below, but in brief, the lifetime of the unique online key is as follows: Key created via the CryptoAPI by the system test computer at the manufacturing plant Key written to EEPROM of Xbox and EEPROM verified that it was correctly written Key encrypted with the public key and stored into the manufacturing genealogy database and transaction verified as committed Memory location of key zeroed and freed Manufacturing genealogy database periodically sent to ITG Redmond Machine account creation fields copied to the Xbox Machine Account Creation Database Machine Account Creation Database queried upon new machine account request Key decrypted by nCypher box and used to authenticate first-time sign up Memory location of key zeroed and freed Database record marked as created Xbox network security starts at the manufacturing plant by creating a unique secret that is shared between the Xbox and the Xbox Online Service.  A unique online key (128-bits long) is generated is generated for each Xbox by the system test computer via the Win32 CryptoAPI and is written to EEPROM of the Xbox.  The key is also combined with an 8-byte confounder and encrypted with a 1024-bit public key.  The encrypted data is persisted into a manufacturing genealogy database along with other information that identifies this machine including the serial number that is visibly stamped on the bottom of the case, the network MAC address and hard drive ID.  The version number of encryption is also written to the genealogy database.   Care is taken to ensure that the unique online key is not exposed in the clear and that the insertion of a phony record into the manufacturing genealogy database requires physical access to the secure factory machines.  The unique online key is never displayed or written to disk.  The memory that contained the key is zeroed out and freed after the successful write to EEPROM and the genealogy database.   The private key to decrypt the unique online key is stored on nCypher boxes in Redmond.  These nCypher boxes are tamper resistant and will destroy all data if physically compromised.  Operator smartcards are required to initialize an nCypher box and are only available in the secure portion of the operations center.  The Machine Account Creation Servers require the operator smartcard to be inserted into the nCypher box before they are turned on and can be removed immediately after the machine starts.  Any loss of power to the Machine Account Creation Server will require the insertion of the operator smartcard before the nCypher box can operate again.  There will be two operator smartcards locked in each secure operations center, one operator smartcard will be locked in the Redmond ITG secure operations center and one operator smartcard in the Dublin secure operations center.   In addition to operator smartcards, there are also administrator smartcards.  Administrator smartcards are required to configure a new nCypher box to work in the operations center, to create operator smartcards and to create more administrator smartcards.  They are protected judiciously.  There are currently six administrator smartcards and it requires at least two of the six, a password and a disk containing binary credentials to do any administrator function.  After the nCypher boxes are configured for use, four of the administrator smartcards will be stored in the ITG secure operations center and the other two in the Dublin secure operations center.  There will be procedures posted at the secure operations centers for access to these cards.  Since it takes at least two of the six administrator cards, Tony Chen and an accomplice must take separate paths back to Millennium from Building 8 in order to avoid whatever Tony was thinking of when he made the requirement to have at least 2 administrator smartcards. The manufacturing genealogy database is periodically sent to ITG.  The machine account creation fields from the manufacturing genealogy database are copied to the Xbox Machine Account Creation Database.  The database schema is documented in the Genealogy Database document.  The compromise of the unique online key is discussed in the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Key_Management_and_Exchange"  key management portion of the threat model Machine Account Creation Database Schema The Machine Account Creation Database is a separate database from the manufacturing genealogy database and contains the following information specific to machine account creation: Description Unique Machine ID assigned by manufacturing serid 8 bytes Serial number assigned by manufacturing createtime date/time NULL until account created macaddr 6 bytes MAC address (must be unique and in range)  8 bytes Hard drive ID uokey 1024 bytes Unique online key (encrypted with public key) encver Version of encryption Xbox Side The machine and user accounts are created through the Xbox Dashboard.  The Dashboard comes up when the user starts the Xbox without a title in the tray or when the title tries to go online without an account.  The UI for the Dashboard is in the Online Dashboard specification. A new machine account must be created when an Xbox comes online for the first time.  This bootstraps the process for subsequent authenticated and secure connections.  Here are the steps that the Xbox Dashboard must do upon first-time connection: Resolve the hard-coded name of the Machine Account Creation Service (new.xbox.com) via DNS Fall back to a hard-coded IP address if DNS is not enabled Encrypt and send machine information to the Machine Account Creation Service  Increment sequence number and send machine information again after timeout Validate N+1  Request and store the returned machine credentials for the machine account After the name of the Machine Account Creation Service (new.xbox.com) has been resolved via DNS, the Xbox and server must follow the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_Account_Creation_Service IK"  Machine Account Creation Protocol .  Once the server has received valid machine information, the server will create a new machine account and return the machine account credentials.  The client must store the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Protocols_and_Information"  Machine Credentials  returned from the server for future connections.  Future connections are covered in   HYPERLINK  \l "_Kerberos_Authentication"  Kerberos Authentication Server Side The server will receive many packets and must process them as fast as possible and detect potential DoS attacks without allocating resources.

The information and time duration may vary between types of servers, but the format will work with our standard parsing and auditing tools that are TBD. How long do we want to keep logs? Alerting of Tier 1 support for suspicious activity There is a plan and process for each alert that can be signaled. Adding servers into the trusted realm Adding servers into the trusted realm There is a tool called ksetup.exe that will install the appropriate key onto a server.  Please see the  documentation  on ksetup by typing it without parameters.  The server key threat model is here. Security for system link play Threat Model This section covers potential security issues and how these will be addressed.  Xbox Network Security uses an augmented threat model that we call KR-STRIDE which is based on the STRIDE put together by the Secure Windows Initiative team.  The STRIDE model has been augmented with several network-specific topics that I wanted to discuss separately from the general STRIDE groupings.  For more information on security, see the SWI team web site at   HYPERLINK "http://swiweb"  http://swiweb Key Management and Exchange The only thing worse than cryptographically weak keys is exchanging strong keys with an adversary.  The secure management and exchange of keys is a fundamental requirement.  Unique Online Key This key is described in the Xbox Machine Account Creation spec. Shared-Trust Server Key Each trusted server (or set of similar servers) in the Xbox Kerberos realm has a shared key with the Xbox TGS.  The compromise of any server s key (or machine) would enable a hacker to create a copy of that service (and redirect their Xbox to connect to that service).  The hacker would be able to replicate any services functionality.  Upon any protocol error with a server during the handshake, the Xbox should post a Service Nonconformance Alert to the TGS, flush all tickets and log off. LAN Key and session key exchange for System link play Since system link play is limited to the subnet and most likely between players in visual range, the goal of a persistent attack will be to exploit a weakness in the network stack or title:  to gain access to the hardware; and/or to deny service on any Xbox connected to the Internet The threat to the platform here is quite serious as there is no authentication, alerting or auditing.  The goal is to mitigate any attack that can be exploited and duplicated across a network and across title.  The attack scenario which we feel is most probable is to find a method to extract the LAN key from any title, then to find a buffer overrun in that title.  The attack can then be replicated across the network. Potential solutions to a breach of security are: Hard-goods recall of the title if it has no online component Patching of the title for online users Replaying Network Messages or Packets Replay is a form of active, malicious attack where a hacker sends part or all of a prior message to gain access, spoof and/or deny service.  Spoofing Identity An example of user identity spoofing is the breaching of a user's authentication information. In this case, the hacker has obtained the user's personal information or something that enables him or her to replay the authentication procedure. Spoofing threats are usually associated with a wily hacker being able to impersonate a valid system user or resource to get access to the system and thereby compromise system security. Tampering with Network Traffic This document defines tampering as the malicious modification of network traffic in transit with or without detection.  All secure Xbox network systems (Xbox consoles and secure servers) use IPSec to detect and destroy tampered packets by validating the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) before the payload gets to the application layer. A tampered packet has these possible causes in order of likelihood: Possible out-of-order sequence number due to network delay A malicious attempt by a hacker to modify the data in transit Repudiability  Repudiability threats are associated with users malicious or otherwise who can deny performing an action without administrators having any way to prove otherwise. An example of a repudiability threat is a user performing an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace such operations. Information Disclosure Information disclosure threats involve the compromising of private or business-critical information through the exposure of that information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user's ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to and an intruder's ability to read data in transit between two computers are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that in this case the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to appear as a legitimate user. Denial of Service (DoS) Denial of service (DoS) threats when carried out deny service to valid users for example, by making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable or by forcing a reboot or restart of the user's machine. You must protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability. Other types of DoS threats, however, are very hard to protect against; at a minimum, you should identify and rationalize such threats. Denial of Service to the Machine Account Creation Servers The Machine Account Creation Servers must be able to withstand DoS attacks by sending bogus credentials and replaying valid credentials.  The Machine Account Creation Servers must determine both of these scenarios as quickly as possible and not lock resources that are used for valid credentials.   The quick validity check should be a stateless procedure that can be preformed by the server by checking the signature of the packet.  If valid credentials are replayed without incrementing the sequence number, then the machine account should be suspended until further investigation and alert  HYPERLINK  \l "_Errors_and_Alerts_1" AID 000002  should be triggered.  If invalid credentials were sent, then alert  HYPERLINK  \l "_Errors_and_Alerts_1" AID 000001  should be triggered. The replay check should cache replay credentials to thwart continuous attempts.  If these attempts are from the same source IP address, it should be blocked until further investigation.  If the credentials contain a valid internal IP address, then that should be blocked as well. All detected attacks should free all resources and should not return anything back to the client. Elevation of Privilege In this type of threat, an unprivileged user gains privileged access and thereby has sufficient access to compromise or destroy the entire system. The more dangerous aspect of such threats is the compromising of the system in undetectable ways whereby the user can take advantage of privileges without the knowledge of system administrators. Elevation of privilege threats include those situations in which an attacker has effectively penetrated all system defenses and become part of the trusted system itself at that point, the attacker can cause extreme system damage. Operations This section is owned by the OPMs and will be fleshed out by them based on the operations needs of the feature. There are a couple of high level sections listed below but the OPMs will have final determination on what is needed in this section. Xbox Key Distribution Center (Xbox KDC) Errors and Alerts Performance and Load Considerations Performance and Load Considerations This section should contain best estimates of how the feature will perform and impact the service once deployed.  This section should include (but is not limited to) items like the following: Average size of data transferred from Xbox to server and/or server to server Average size of data that is stored on the server by the feature The frequency of this data exchange Maximum data size allowed to be transferred / stored Number of data exchanges the servers will have to support over a given time (i.e. 50 requests / second) Machine Account Creation Database Errors and Alerts Performance and Load Considerations Ticket Granting Server (TGS) Errors and Alerts AID 00000003: Server exists but cannot authenticate itself with client Immediate Action:  View name of service presented in alert. View machine and user name presented in alert. Threat:  Possible compromise of Kerberos shared trust key for service Possible server-side spoofing attack against client.. Possible DoS attack against service. Process: Valid Xbox machine and user will flush all tickets and authenticate again. Monitor machine and user account for continual authentication attempts. Suspend machine and user account upon suspicious activity.  Performance and Load Considerations Call Center Cannot create machine account Process: Get the Xbox Serial Number Manually walk the user through sign up procedure Refurbishment Center Creating a new machine account Process: Get the Xbox Serial Number Manually walk the user through sign up procedure Dependencies If needed:  This section should cover any Internal / External dependencies that the feature has.  This section should also address schedule issues with the dependencies. International If needed:  This section should detail any considerations that should be made for International (all non-English Languages). This could include detailing encoding of data on the wire, how strings are stored in the databases, considerations for UI, Legal, etc. Technical Certification Requirements Standard UI when Authentication Failed Requirement: The game must show standard UI when authentication failed. LAN Key exchange When two or more XBoxes are connected directly via a cross-cable or an Ethernet hub, a game title can offer a multiplayer experience known as LAN play.  It differs from Internet play in that there is no contact with the XBox Online Service infrastructure, and it is free of charge.  The XBox will never contact Passport or our KDC, will never obtain a Kerberos ticket, and will never contact any computer other than a peer XBox on the same LAN segment. Even when running in LAN play mode, we still want to require all communication to be authenticated to help prevent denial-of-service attacks, cheating, hacking, and buffer-overrun exploits.  Of course, since we don t have any way of authenticating the XBox through Kerberos, we are left with using pre-shared keys that are hidden in the game title. The typical scenario for discovery of available game sessions would be as follows.  An XBox, call it XB1, decides to publish a game session.  It calls XNetCreateLANSession that generates a unique session ID and a unique key-exchange-key, just like the matchmaking service did for the online case.  It then calls XNetRegisterPeerSession with this information, and calls WINSOCK to listen for incoming connections.  Finally, it calls XNetRegisterBroadcastKey with the pre-shared key hidden in the title, and calls WINSOCK to begin listening for broadcasts.  Another XBox, call it XB2, wishes to discover the available sessions so it calls XNetRegisterBroadcastKey with the same pre-shared key hidden in the title, and then uses WINSOCK to send a broadcast packet in ESPUDP format that is authenticated with the pre-shared key, and begins listening for responses. XB1 will receive the broadcast packet and will respond with its game session information.  It does this by first calling XNetRegisterLANAddress passing in the IP address of the XB2 it obtained from WINSOCK along with NULL for the session ID.  This allocates a private IP address that can be passed to WINSOCK to open a connection and send the response, which should include at a minimum the unique session ID and key-exchange-key for the game session being published.  The NULL session ID instructs the XNet stack to authenticate the packets using the broadcast key instead of performing full XBox-to-XBox key-exchange.  The ESPUDP packet will be marked with a special SPI (such as 1) that means the default security association whose key was specified by a call to XNetRegisterBroadcastKey.  This is done to prevent a flood of responses from available game sessions swamping the querying XBox with requests for key-exchange and the setting up of Security Associations.  This means, of course, that replay protection is disabled for these responses since this SPI is many-to-one.  The game title will have to be resilient to replay for responses by using nonces and encrypting parts of the broadcast and response payloads with the pre-shared key.  The XNet stack will probably only allow UDP responses to use this mechanism to discourage long-term connections. XB2 now has received one or more responses including the one from XB1.  Inside the response is the encrypted unique session ID and key-exchange-key along with any other information about the game session being published.  If it wishes to open a connection to XB1 to join the game session, it calls XNetRegisterPeerSession with the session ID and key-exchange-key.  Then calls XNetRegisterLANAddress with the IP address for XB1 and the session ID and gets back a private IP address that it can pass to DPLAY or WINSOCK to open a connection.  At this point the XNet stack behaves the same as described in the previous section, including performing peer-to-peer key-exchange using the key-exchange-key of the session. It might be advantageous to automatically encrypt as well as authenticate the payloads of LAN broadcast packets and the UDP responses.  This would make sure that a title developer didn t reveal the session ID and key-exchange-key during the negotiation, and would make the LAN discovery code easier to write since portions of a packet no longer need to be manually encrypted.  This has the added benefit that it will discourage title developers from being too verbose in responding to broadcasts, which should keep the usage of the mechanism to a minimum. The purpose of this e-mail is to kick off a discussion of what form of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) should be implemented on the XBox for establishing secure IPSec communcation between an XBox and a server.  We are already shipping a proprietary XBox-to-XBox key exchange protocol, the details of which can be found in http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/Xbox-Key-Exchange.doc. Assumptions XBox uses Kerberos for client to server authentication.  The XBox client will have acquired a kerberos ticket for a service by some means prior to initiating key exchange with a server. XBox will initiate key exchange with a server.  A server will never initiate key exchange with an XBox. XBox may be behind a NAT.  A server will never be behind a NAT. Because XBox may be behind a NAT, we use ESPUDP encapsulation to multiplex all traffic on a single UDP port.  XBox client is not interested in negotiating ESPUDP vs. ESP encapsulation with a server in the case where an XBox is in the clear.  For code simplicity, we will always use ESPUDP encapsulation even when XBox is in the clear. For the purpose of keeping NAT mapping alive, XBox client is responsible for sending periodic keep-alive traffic. Average latency between XBox and server will be anywhere from 50ms to 100ms. Proposal 1: Use IKE-Kerberos Using IKE-Kerberos as the key exchange mechanism between XBox and server is the default mechanism we've all been assuming will be used.  However, we should be clear what we really mean by IKE-Kerberos.  It is the IKE key exchange protocol, modified to use Kerberos authentication, and then further modified to support ESPUDP through NAT (i.e. detect NAT mapping and support ESPUDP multiplexing on the IKE UDP port). Here are the issues I have with this plan: It requires at least six round-trips and the establishment of two SA's (main mode and quick mode).  This many round-trips makes session establishment a considerable fraction of a second even before any data is transferred.  This places requirements on how often the XBox should establish and tear down SA's to avoid this latency. It is subject to denial-of-service attack by any PC which floods the server with initiator cookies.  The proposed solution to fix this vulnerability introduces another round-trip in the protocol to verify that the source IP address is valid.  However, this only makes the denial-of-service attack a little more difficult to perform.  Any PC with a network card in promiscuious mode can easily respond to the challenge packet, causing the server to consume resources as before. Multiplexing the IKE port for ESPUDP traffic adds 8 bytes of zeroes to every data packet.  This is unfortunate because data packets are much more common than IKE packets. Proposal 2: Use Manual Keying (XBox Proprietary) This proposal attempts to target only the requirements of the XBox client.  I believe that the XBox to server key exchange can be completed in one round-trip, as follows: Esess[dwSpiInit, abNonceInit, g^X, KerbTkt, KerbAuth, IP-Server] This message is signed with the session key of the Kerberos ticket.  The KerbAuth structure contains the time at the client which must be within five minutes of the server time.  Upon receipt of this message, the server can crack the ticket, extract the session key, authenticate the KerbAuth blob, and authenticate the entire message (inlcuding IP-server matching its own IP address).  If any of these checks fail, the message is dropped and no response is sent. If the message is authentic, then there is a chance it has been replayed within the last five minutes.  To combat this, the keying module maintains a table indexed by the nonce of the initiator.  An entry is added to the table whenever an authenticated key-exchange initiator is received.  If the nonce of the initiator is already present in the table, the message is dropped and no response is sent.  Note that the entry in the table needs to be maintained for a maximum of five minutes, since the KerbAuth structure contains a time-value that must be within five minutes of the current time for the message to be accepted in the first place.  Note further that a hacker is unable to flood this table because it only grows when a properly authenticated message is received.  The table will grow to a maximum size of the sum of all initiator nonces received in any five minute period.  Placing a fixed-size cap on this size (and using LRU) should be acceptable and will only open the server up to a very limited form of attack. If all goes well, the server generates a g^Y and computes g^XY, assigns a dwSpiResp, computes the SHA and 3DES keys, and sends back to the XBox: Esess[dwSpiInit, dwSpiResp, abNonceInit, abNonceResp, g^Y, IP-Server] This message is signed with the session key of the Kerberos ticket.  The XBox then verifies the signature, the initiator nonce, and all the fields of the message.  It computes g^XY, the SHA and 3DES keys, and is ready to transmit ESPUDP packets to the server. If the XBox receives no response from its earlier key-exchange attempt, it picks a new initiator nonce, constructs a new KerbAuth, and tries the entire process again. The features of this proposal: It involves just one self-authenticated round-trip Because it is not based on IKE, we can pick another port (say 3074, the IANA assigned XBox game port) to multiplex ESPUDP traffic and key-exchange traffic.  This time, however, we can optimize for data traffic having the smaller overhead and pimp the key-exchange traffic. There is only one SA per successful key-exchange (no main-mode/quick-mode crap) It does not generate traffic in response to denial-of-service attacks. As far as rekeying is concerned, I don't think it is important for the type of communication an XBox will make with a server.  If a connection is very long-lived, we can always make it a TCR that the client must establish a new SA every so often. Comments? As I said earlier, this is just a proposal to get discussion going.  Let me know what you think. -- drm  Revision History Changes made Author 6/6/01 First Draft DamonD 6/11/01 Finished Executive Summary and Overview DamonD Microsoft Confidential.

Commercial Reference of Product Xbox Video Game System/Xbox Console de Jeu Vid Version 1 General Description of the product The Microsoft Xbox Video Game System (Xbox) is Microsoft's future-generation video game system.  The Xbox is a video game console that allows users to play games on television sets.  The Xbox closely resembles a desktop computer in its main specifications: it is powered by an Intel Pentium III 733 MHz processor and an NVIDIA 233 MHz Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).  The Xbox has 64MB of RAM, 1024kb of ROM (firmware), an internal 8 GB hard drive, a 5x DVD-ROM drive with movie playback, 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port, broadband compatibility and HDTV support. The Xbox will be generally available for purchase by the public through retail outlets independent of Microsoft, and will be sold in large volume without restriction through mail order, electronic and telephone sales.  Microsoft will distribute the Xbox its mass-market retail channel distribution system, including thousands of resellers and distributors.  This product will be available to customers from many third-party resellers via various combinations of retail presence, web, phone or mail order.  The recommended retail price of an Xbox is $299. Despite its many functions   video games, DVD and music CDROM playback, Internet connectivity to gaming servers and websites - the Xbox is not a general purpose computer that can host arbitrary applications; it is designed primarily for online and local gaming. Game titles are distributed on Xbox Game Media in a special DVD format or downloaded via the Xbox online service.  The Xbox System Software (XSS) is statically linked into the game title DVD and has been pared down to the essential functions for fast and stable operation as a gaming platform. No cryptographic algorithms are contained in the code of the title.  All cryptographic algorithms are stored in the firmware of the device.   This document describes encryption systems that are used by games without an online component.  The online authentication and security is currently under development and will be disclosed in detail when the online service launches later in 2002. Technical Overview of system The technical specifications are located in the Appendix. Xbox Hardware Components Central Processing Unit (CPU) The Xbox runs on a Pentium III 733 MHz chip.  Intel s website for CTP calculations list this chip at just over 1710 MTOPs.  (  HYPERLINK "http://support.intel.com/support/processors/ctp.htm#13"  http://support.intel.com/support/processors/ctp.htm#13 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) The Xbox GPU (XGPU) is a graphics processor capable of a 3D vector rate of less than 100 million.  Hard drive (HD) The Xbox contains an 8MB (or larger) hard drive that stores data cached from the game title DVD, downloaded games and content, Kerberos user account credentials, Kerberos machine account credentials, and machine and user settings. Memory Unit (MU) The standard Xbox Game Controller supports up to 2 slots that can accept Memory Units.  A memory unit is a cartridge that can store game data and user credentials.  The MU may be removed so that data can roam with the user. General Cryptographic Principles There are some principles that help understand the design goals and cryptography of the Xbox: No cryptographic algorithms are contained in the code of the title.  All cryptographic algorithms are stored in the firmware of the device. Game developers cannot directly access the cryptography algorithms in the Xbox firmware for generic encryption services.  All access to these algorithms is done by the XSS with set purposes described below.  The game title code statically links with the XSS. The XSS is only accessible to approved Xbox game developers, not to the Xbox user or general public. The XSS only exposes functionality for purposes of securing data from the Xbox (e.g. authentication, System Link Play gaming data, credit card information, etc). There are specific algorithms and key lengths in the XSS that cannot be replaced or enhanced by the developer or the user. The exposed services define one transport encryption means (modified IPSec). The Xbox is not designed for significant user-defined secret messaging. System Link Play This document covers the security used to encrypt traffic when two Xbox consoles are directly connected together via a network cable or into the same Ethernet hub.  System Link Play does not include  Internet  play and the security for that will be disclosed at a later time. There are no trusted 3rd party authentication mechanisms in this scenario so an alternative method of mutual authentication is described below. Encryption Algorithms All cryptographic algorithms that are used by the game titles are located in the firmware shipped with the Xbox hardware.  The game titles use these algorithms for network authentication, network traffic encryption, key exchange, data encryption, content signing and content verification.   The processes for network authentication, network traffic encryption and key exchange for System Link Play are disclosed in this document.  A later submission will include Internet play. The processes of content encryption, signing and verification for software copy protection are not disclosed in this document. Location of cryptographic algorithms All cryptographic algorithms are located in the firmware of the Xbox.  Only the Xbox System Software provided by Microsoft can access the cryptography routines in firmware.  The game title code cannot directly access these methods for generic cryptography services, but must use the XSS code to perform tasks securely. These algorithms and key sizes are enabled: Component Algorithm-Key Length(s) Xbox Firmware DES-56 3DES-168 RC4-128 RC4-384 SHA1-HMAC-128 RSA-1024 RSA-2048 DH-KEYX-768 DH-KEYX-1024 DH-KEYX-2048 Xbox System Software Xbox Game Titles Usage of cryptographic algorithms Traditionally, gaming systems with a dedicated console were standalone machines that accommodated a limited number of players (e.g., 2-4 players).  Personal computer-based gaming grew in popularity in part due to the ability to play games online with many remote players over the Internet.  Thus, one trend for dedicated gaming systems is to provide capabilities to facilitate gaming over a network, such Internet-based online gaming and LAN-based gaming where multiple consoles are connected through a local area network (LAN).  One challenge in network gaming is to protect network traffic between any two game consoles from tampering or observation by other devices on the network.  Gamers are notorious for developing creative cheating mechanisms.  For example, gamers have used computers to display portions of a game map which would otherwise not be visible, or modified unprotected network traffic to give themselves advantages during play, such as perfect aim, faster players, and so on.  Unfortunately, previous console-based gaming systems did not provide for secure communications.   Accordingly, there is a need for a system architecture that supports secure communications between two or more gaming systems over a local area network.

This is the only hardware configuration that allows development and debugging (or tracing through executing code).  Code compiled for the special development hardware will not run on a retail Xbox console nor will retail Xbox Game Media be loaded by the special development hardware. Key Management The keys for network authentication, network traffic encryption and key exchange for System Link Play are disclosed in this document.  The keys for content encryption, signing and verification for software copy protection are not disclosed in this document. Keys are used for System Link Play: Size (bits) Location Usage ROM Key Used to generate LAN Key Title Key Used to generate LAN Key LAN Key Memory LAN key is shared by the same title and allows System Link Play Broadcast encryption key Memory Generated by LAN key and used to encrypt broadcast traffic Broadcast signing key Memory Generated by LAN key and used to sign broadcast traffic Memory Randomly generated key unique to gaming session Security Association keys Memory Shared by a pair to encrypt/sign traffic between them IPSec ESPUDP The Xbox will include an implementation of the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) modified to work through Network Address Translation devices (NATs).  The Xbox team refers to this modification as  IPSec ESPUDP , but it will be listed and described as  IPSec  throughout the document. Xbox Secure Network Library (XSNL) All game title code must use the Xbox Secure Network Library (XSNL) to communicate with any other device over the network.  Games cannot write their own net stack that communicates directly with the hardware.  This is a requirement for certification as an Xbox Game Title.  The game title code does not directly call the authentication and encryption code, but instead uses a higher-level abstraction to connect.  All of the underlying security described below is performed by the XSNL. Xbox IPSec Overview In an effort to deter cheating, hardware retasking, mapping, denial of service, and other forms of malicious attacks on the Xbox console through the Ethernet port, all Xbox to Xbox and Xbox to server communication will use the IPSec ESPUDP format to authenticate and encrypt the contents of each packet.  The purpose of this document is to describe the layout of each packet type transmitted by an Xbox, the algorithms used to secure these packets, the state machine run by each endpoint, as well as the specific encryption, authentication, and transformations performed to the data and keys, including how each type of key is generated. The Xbox includes a modified implementation of the Internet Protocol Security that we call IPSec ESPUDP.  The modification was necessary to allow traffic to flow through Network Address Translation devices (NATs) that may not understand the proposed IETF standard format that places the ESP header between the IP header and the transport layer header.  The modification is documented below. An Xbox will be able to negotiate IPSec sessions with external devices on the Internet using 56-bit DES or 168-bit 3DES session keys.  The Xbox IPSec protocol is embedded as an integral part of the XSNL.  IPSec provides security services for IP version 4 (RFC 791) at the IP layer. The set of security services that IPSec provides are access control, connectionless integrity, protection against replayed packets (a form of partial sequence integrity), confidentiality (encryption). Because these services are provided at the IP layer, they are automatically in place for any game traffic regardless of transport layer (UDP or TCP). The Xbox IPSec protocol can be used to protect one or more "paths" between a pair of Xbox consoles.  Using IPSec, two Xbox consoles can mutually authenticate (machine to machine) with a peer system before transmitting or receiving application data between them.  In this sense, IPSec is a security service provided by the XSNL, transparently, for game data. The IPSec architectural design was developed as a series of RFC specification documents by the IPSec Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  See   HYPERLINK "http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html"  http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html  for updated standards information.  The Xbox implementation is close to, but does not conform to the RFC specifications listed in the References section as they do not work through Network Address Translation devices (NATs).   The RFC defines two protocols to provide traffic security   Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). The IP Authentication Header (AH) provides connectionless integrity, data origin authentication, and an optional anti-replay service.  The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides confidentiality (encryption), connectionless integrity and an anti-replay service.  Both AH and ESP are vehicles for access control, based on the distribution of cryptographic keys and the management of traffic flows relative to these security protocols.  These protocols may be applied alone or in combination with each other to provide a desired set of security services in IPv4 (and eventually IPv6).  Each protocol supports two modes of use: transport mode and tunnel mode.  Xbox only uses ESP in transport mode at this time. Encryption functions The following provides a description of the cryptographic functions offered by the product. Xbox IPSec supports DES (56bit key strength) encryption algorithm, 3DES (168bit key strength) encryption algorithm, SHA-1 integrity algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman technique for shared symmetric key generation in accordance with the RFCs.  These algorithms are supported in all combinations in the ESP format. Modified IPSec format The Xbox IPSec packets are formatted like the ESP packets described in RFC 2406 with a slight modification to travel through NATs.  The RFC defines an IP packet that has been transformed into an ESP packet having the ESP header immediately following the IP header.  In our case, we insert a UDP header just before the ESP header.  The format of a secure ESPUDP packet is shown below: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IP] |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                        Source Address                         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                     Destination Address                       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ <-- ADDED BY XBOX |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESP] |                 Security Parameters Index (SPI)               | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  |                        Sequence Number                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IV] |                Encryption Initialization Vector               | |           (Added only if packet is being encrypted)           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [Payload] ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESPT] ~       Padding (variable)      |  Pad Length   |  Next Header  | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                Authentication Data (12-bytes)                 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ The format of a secure TCP packet will be the same except that the second [UDP] header will be a [TCP] header.  Note that the initialization vector is only added to a packet that is encrypted.  The encrypted portion of the packet begins just after the initialization vector and ends just before the Authentication Data. Whether the packet is encrypted or not, it will always end with 12-bytes of Authentication Data, which is the first 12-bytes of the digest produced by performing a keyed HMAC-SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet starting at [ESP] and ending just before the Authentication Data.  If the packet is encrypted, encryption occurs first, then the encrypted contents are hashed. An important point to keep in mind from a security perspective is that the [IP] header and the outer [UDP] header are neither authenticated nor encrypted.  We must therefore assume that any or all of these fields can be spoofed by the sender, or modified in transit.  We cannot authenticate these fields because NATs between the Xbox console and Xbox Online Service may modify them. The reason for adding the outer [UDP] header is to force all packets to use exactly one UDP source port no matter how many actual source ports the title uses. Security Association (SA) Security associations (SA) between the Xbox console and another Xbox console.  An SA is uniquely identified by the Security Parameter Index (SPI).  The IPSec key material is not logged or retained for a long period of time after the Xbox disconnects or the connection is closed.  The keys are never written to disk.  The security association is never renewed. Pre and post treatments The data is formatted into full Internet Protocol packets first before IPSec is applied. An IPSec packet may be fragmented into multiple pieces in accordance with RFC 791 standard methods of IP datagram fragmentation and reassembly.  The IP packet or fragment is then encapsulated by the link layer protocol (IEEE 802.3 Ethernet CD/CSMA frame). System Link Play Overview System Link Play is defined as two or more Xbox consoles connected via an Ethernet cross cable or via an Ethernet bridge.  It is assumed that all Xbox consoles can be reached via Ethernet broadcast and that these will only communicate with other Xbox consoles and not with any sort of server, including PC game servers, DHCP or DNS servers, or routers.   This architecture allows multiple game consoles to establish secure communication over a local area network. In the described implementation, the system architecture supports a three-phase secure communication protocol.  The first phase involves generating shared keys that are unique to an authentic game console running an authentic game title.  The same game consoles running the same games will create the same shared keys.  In the second phase, a  client  console attempts to discover existing game sessions being hosted by a   game console by broadcasting a request over the local area network.  The broadcast request expresses a desire to join in playing the game at the next convenient opportunity.  The broadcast request is protected using the shared keys.  If the host console agrees to let the client console play, the host console generates session keys that are returned securely to the client console.  The third phase involves a key exchange in which the client and host consoles exchange data used to derive one or more secrets.  The key exchange is protected using the session keys.  The secrets are then used to establish a secure point-to-point link between the two consoles for ongoing communication. Phase 1: Generation of System Link Play shared secret keys Before Xbox consoles can communicate via System Link Play, a secret key that is unique to an authentic gaming system running an authentic game title is generated.  The Xbox console stores a key in a secure location, such as in a protected portion of ROM.  This key will be the same for all Xbox consoles.  Additionally, each game title certified to play on the Xbox gaming system has an associated unique, randomly-generated title key.  The title key is the same for every copy of the same game title.  Different titles have different title keys.  The title key may be stored as part of the game title, such as on the DVD or with a softcopy of the game title that was legitimately purchased online and downloaded for storage on the hard disk drive of the game console. A LAN key is generated using the ROM key and the title-based key during network stack initialization.  The LAN key is generated by performing an HMAC-SHA-1 (Hashed Message Authentication Code Secure Hash Algorithm 1) on the Title key using the ROM key as the HMAC key. The LAN key is then used to produce shared secret keys (broadcast encryption key and signature key) for all System Link Play gaming sessions for that title.  Generation of the broadcast encryption and signature keys is performed once during initialization.  All Xbox gaming systems running the same title will generate the same pair of keys.  Any Xbox gaming system running a different title on the same LAN will have a different pair of keys.  The combination of keys prevents anyone from discovering how to intercept or modify broadcast messages for a particular game simply by being able to read the game title.   Phase 2: Session Discovery After key generation, the second phase of the secure communication protocol starts when client Xbox console attempts to discover whether any other Xbox consoles on the LAN are currently hosting a multiplayer game session for that particular title.  With only a few Xbox consoles connected on a small local area network, there is not expected to be more than one or two consoles currently hosting a particular game hence the client Xbox console is left to discover suitable hosts on its own through a broadcast technique.  The second phase is described in the context of a general flow of operations performed by a requesting client Xbox console and a potential host Xbox console.  The client Xbox console is requesting sessions to join.  The host Xbox console has started a session for others to join.  The operations are illustrated beneath the client and host consoles to convey where such operations are performed. The client Xbox console generates a request REQ containing a request message and an optional randomly generated nonce Ni (the initiator s nonce).  The client Xbox console encrypts the request using a symmetric key cipher E (e.g., DES) that employs the title broadcast encryption key described above (denoted as KE), as follows: REQE = EKE[request message, Ni]. The client Xbox console digitally signs the request using the title broadcast signature key described above (denoted as KS), as follows: REQES = SKS[REQE]. The client Xbox console broadcasts the encrypted and signed request REQES to other devices on the LAN.  The host Xbox console has previously opened a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) socket and is listening for discovery broadcast messages over the LAN.  All Xbox consoles hosting a game session of the same game title will recognize the request because they are able to generate the same set of title broadcast keys, and hence can authenticate and decrypt the message.  Xbox consoles running different game titles, however, will disregard the message.   The host Xbox console authenticates the request using the same title broadcast signature key and decrypts the message using the same title broadcast encryption key, as follows: REQ = DKE[REQE]. The host console decides whether to allow the requesting client console to participate in the network game.  Factors affecting this decision include the number of current players, number of players supported by the game, current status of the game (i.e., just beginning, middle of session, etc.), and so on.  Assuming that the host console will accept a new client console with one or more players, the host console generates a unique pair of randomly generated keys used to distinguish between different sessions.  These keys include a network key identifier NKID and a network key exchange key NKEY.  The identifier NKID is simply a name for the key NKEY and uniquely identifies the session to the client Xbox console.  The session keys are created by a random number generator.  These keys are used in the key exchange phase described below.  The session key NKEY will be used in the future to authenticate the contents of key exchange packets exchanged between the two Xbox consoles, whereas the key identifier NKID is used to specify the game session to which the source client Xbox console is connecting.  It is noted that the session keys NKID and NKEY may be pre-generated prior to receiving any request from a client Xbox console. The host Xbox console creates a reply to the discovery request.  The reply contains, at a minimum, a reply message, the NKID / NKEY pair, and a network address NADDR of the host Xbox console.  The reply message may include the initiator s nonce Ni, a responder s nonce Nr, and game specific data.  The host Xbox console encrypts the reply using the title broadcast encryption key, as follows: REPLYE = EKE[reply message, NKID, NKEY, NADDR]. The host Xbox console signs the reply using the title broadcast signature key (denoted as KS), as follows: REPLYES = SKS[REPLYE]. The host Xbox console broadcasts the reply across the local area network to all other devices, including the requesting client Xbox console.  The client console authenticates and decrypts the reply.  Every host console responds with its own encrypted broadcast reply containing its network address, as well as an encryption key and identifier specific to that game session.  Having discovered one or more hosts available on the network, the client communicates with the desired host using session key pair of that host.  Any other session key pairs returned by other potential hosts are discarded.  Phase 3: Key Exchange for pair-wise console communication The third phase of the System Link Play secure communication protocol starts when the client and host perform a secure key exchange to establish a secure point-to-point link for ongoing communication.  After game session discovery described above, the client and host Xbox consoles share a title broadcast encryption key and a title broadcast signature key, as well as a session key pair NKID/NKEY for a particular game session that was returned in the host reply.   Now, the client and host consoles exchange data used to derive one or more keys that are used to secure point-to-point communication.  The client and host Xbox consoles use Diffie-Hellman exponentiation operations to derive a new secret that is shared between the two consoles without transmitting that secret across the LAN.  The key exchange is protected using the session key. For the discussion purposes, suppose the client console is the initiator of the key exchange and the host is the responder.  When the client sends the first packet, the client notices that there is no security association established between the game client and game host.  The packet is placed on a packet queue and the key exchange process is started. The client creates an initial key exchange packet KeyExInit.  The packet includes secrets used to derive symmetric keys used to secure communication in a point-to-point communication link.  The key exchange packet is a UDP packet with a payload containing the following data: Data Field Definition NonceInit This field contains a random nonce created by the initiator.  It is used to validate replies and compute keys. NonceResp This field contains a random nonce created by the responder.  It is used to validate replies and compute keys. This field contains the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation provided by the initiator. This field specifies the key identifier that identifies the game session key and that both consoles have by virtue of the second phase session discovery. NADDR This field contains the complete network address information of the sender of the message. This field contains a time value that is used to limit replay attacks.  Every time a key exchange packet it transmitted (or retransmitted for timeouts), this value is incremented by one unit and that time is transmitted in the key exchange packet.  Should the initiator or responder reboot and attempt to rejoin the same game session (because it reacquired the same NKID / NKEY pair from the game host via broadcast when it came back up), its system time will have moved forward by many thousands if not millions of units.  The purpose of this scheme is to prevent the replay of key exchange initiator packets disrupting the security association between a pair of consoles. This field contains a hash digest of the key exchange packet. The client console computes a hash digest of the entire message using the session key NKEY and a hashing function H, as follows: HashInit = HNKEY [NonceInit, gX, NKID, NADDR, Time]. Accordingly, creation of the initial key exchange packet KeyExInit involves generating a random nonce  NonceInit , filling in the computed Diffie-Hellman value  , filling in the NKID and NADDR fields, and incrementing and setting the   field.  All other fields are zeroed.  The hash digest of all preceding fields ( HashInit ) is placed in the   field of the key exchange packet so that the packet can be authenticated by the receiving console (e.g., host console).  The resulting packet is as follows: KeyExInit: [NonceInit, gX, NKID, NADDR, Time, HashInit]. The client Xbox console sends the initial key exchange packet KeyExInit to the host Xbox console.  When this message is received, the host Xbox console uses the key identifier in the NKID field to identify the key NKEY of the particular game session.  The session key is then used to authenticate the message as originating from the client console.  More particularly, the host uses the session key NKEY to compute a hash digest of the contents and compare that digest to the attached  HashInit  value received in the initial key exchange packet. The host Xbox console creates a responsive key exchange packet (denoted as  KeyExResp ).  In the continuing example, the host console generates a random nonce  NonceResp , fills in its computed value from the Diffie-Hellman function gY, fills in the NKID and NADDR fields, and increments and sets the   field.  The  NonceInit  field is copied from the initial message.  The host console hashes the response packet using the session key NKEY, as follows: HashResp = HNKEY [NonceInit, NonceResp, gY, NKID, NADDR, Time]. The hash digest is placed in the   field of the key exchange packet.  The response packet now has the following contents: KeyExResp: [NonceInit, NonceResp, gY, NKID, NADDR, Time, HashResp]. The host Xbox console sends the response key exchange packet KeyExResp to the client console.  Upon receipt, the client Xbox console uses the key identifier in the NKID field to identify the session key NKEY.  The session key (NKEY) is then used to authenticate the message as originating from the host Xbox console.  That is, the client uses the session key NKEY to compute a hash digest of the response packet and compare that digest to the attached  HashResp  value received in the response packet. At this point, both the host and the client have enough data to compute security association keys.  Security association keys are used to secure point-to-point communication between two consoles.  In this example, each console uses the two Diffie-Hellman exponentiations to compute function gXY.  Each console can then compute four different digests using NonceInit, NonceResp, and gXY as input, as well as the session key NKEY.  These digests are used to form the security association keys. Once the client has the security association keys, it is free to transmit any packets that have been waiting for key exchange to complete.  The host console, however, is not free to do so even though it has the same set of keys because it cannot be sure that its response message KeyExResp was not lost.  The host waits until it either receives a KeyExAck message or until it receives a packet authenticated with the computed security association key.   In the common case, the client console sends a packet to the host and thus, the key exchange process consists of just two messages KeyExInit and KeyExResp.  Should the client not have a packet to send, it will send an artificial acknowledge message (denoted as  KeyExAck ).  This message differs from the two other key exchange messages in that the message is hashed using the computed security association key instead of the session key NKEY.   From this point forward, the two consoles use the security association keys to secure communications.  All network packets that need to be transmitted to the other consoles are authenticated after optionally being encrypted, with the receiving console verifying the authentication data before decrypting the packet contents.  Once a game session is finished, either console can stop accepting key-exchange requests from any console us he following algorithm.  At XNet initialization time, we gather randomness from the disk, memory, and EEPROM values of the Xbox.  We fill a vector of bytes with values such as the tick count, system time, performance counter, system memory status, hard disk free space, and hard disk model and serial number.  Then we read a special sector on the hard disk (sector 8, also known as the first config sector) that is reserved for the random number generator.  The sector contains a 20-byte digest that we add to the vector of bytes we are generating.  We perform a SHA-1 hash of all of these bytes to generate a 20-byte digest.  This digest is used to initialize an RC4 machine.  The RC4 machine is then used to generate a new 20-byte digest, and this digest is written to the sector on the hard disk for use the next time the network stack is initialized.  To generate random numbers, we simply run the RC4 machine as much as necessary to produce the number of bytes requested.

This process is the gateway to XBox Online.  If this process fails for whatever reason, the user will be blocked from any further access to the system.  XBox Online will use Kerberos as the authentication protocol and Passport accounts as the identity.  The process of authentication is with the Passport KDC.  Once the user is authenticated, the user must present the proof of authentication (ticket) to the XBox KDC for authorization to use various services.  Once the user is authorized, the user can continue and go about their online game play as appropriate. Because this process is complex and involves many interactions with different systems, we abstract the concepts away from the developers and the user.  To them, this is a seamless process.  This document describes the APIs and features of the authentication and authorization systems used by XBox Online Service that allow for all this to happen underneath a simple set of APIs. Schedule status  Milestone Description 10/21/01 Spec (v0.9) Complete Initial spec milestone Spec (v0.9) complete For all priority-0 features (necessary for launch of XBox Online gaming service), this is the initial milestone to be spec complete.  This milestone is met when a spec of v0.9 is complete.  This means that thoughts are now laid down on paper and not all issues will be resolved.  In fact, there will be many issues not resolved within the spec, but it will be ready to be reviewed and have others provide feedback and bring up more issues to be resolved later. Goals The XBox Online Authentication and Authorization systems have the following goals: Authentication of XBox console:  allows the service a reasonable level of confidence that the entity it is communicating with is indeed an XBox Single/Multi User authentication:  allows up to 4 users to authenticate to the service Authorization of users: dispense permissions as appropriate to users of the system Deny service:  prevent unauthorized use of the system Non-Goals The following are non-goals for the XBox Online Authentication and Authorization system: General authentication mechanism:  the XBox Online Authentication system described herein is used for XBox Online only and should not be viewed as a general authentication mechanism. General authorization system:  the XBox Online Authorization system was designed specifically for XBox Online services only and should not be used outside this context.  Many assumptions were made that may not apply to other systems. Multiple simultaneous logins:  The system specifically disallows multiple simultaneous logins.  If a user is currently logged in and the same user logs in at another location, the first user is logged off.  This is enforced via the presence system and is mentioned here as a non-goal for support. Assumptions This document makes the following assumptions: Account existence:  in order to authenticate a user, an account must be present.  This document assumes that accounts are present on the client XBox either on the HD or the XMU attached to the XBox and the system can located these accounts Passport existence:  as noted earlier, the identities used are Passport accounts.  In addition, many new features were added to Passport in order to make this work.  These features are assumed to be in Passport and ALL Passport accounts that pass through XOS.  Please see   HYPERLINK  \l "_Dependencies"  dependencies  for further details. Kerberos:  this document assumes the reader is familiar with the Kerberos protocol.  For information on Kerberos v5, the specific version that we use, please refer to the latest draft of Kerberos on the IETF web site,   HYPERLINK "http://www.ietf.org"  http://www.ietf.org MACS and UACS:  this document assumes the reader is knowledgeable of the MACS server and the UACS server that describes machine account creation and user account creation.  Please refer to respective documents for more information. Policies The use of Passport has a number of policies attached to it and is called out here to make sure the reader understands why some of the design decision were made as such. User owns the Passport:  Though it is XOS that created the user s Passport and the Passport resides in XO namespace, the user owns the Passport.  XOS cannot delete this Passport account under any circumstances and only the user has that right.  Note, however, that XOS has the right to delete a specific credential inside of the Passport account   namely the XBox credentials.  The best that XO can do is EVICT a user from our namespace   this forces the user, the next time they logon to a Passport enabled site, to rename their Passport to something outside the XO namespace.  This, however, does have its limitations   a maximum of two users with the same name can be evicted at any one time and the namespace cannot be reclaimed.  Ex.  User   HYPERLINK "mailto:joe@xbox.com"  joe@xbox.com  is evicted.  Even before Joe gets to the PC to login again, another user can then be created with the same name,   HYPERLINK "mailto:joe@xbox.com"  joe@xbox.com  however, his password MUST be of a different length than the original Joe.  Moreover, if we need to evict   HYPERLINK "mailto:joe@xbox.com"  joe@xbox.com  (the second one), we won t be able to until the initial one has renamed himself.  Once we are in this state, we will not be able to create another   HYPERLINK "mailto:joe@xbox.com"  joe@xbox.com  and this name is frozen. Issue:  Not sure about this   do we get to evict the second Joe and then fail to create another user named Joe or we fail on the eviction call? Issue:  Can you un-evict a user? Domain name owner owns support:  Since XO owns the .xbox.com namespace, we are the only ones who can create a Passport within this namespace.  As such, we own this namespace completely (but not the Passports   as noted above).  This means that if a user forgets their password, they will call XO up for support, NOT Passport. Issue:  A policy still needs to be agreed upon how long we MUST support a user AFTER they have been evicted from our namespace but have not logged in to change their name. Issue:  We need to figure out how to minimize customer calls to CSR for passwords reset.  In fact, we can t tell them the password over the phone   or can we?  Do they just login and change it immediately?  CSR tool needs to be present to do this.  UI in the dash maybe needed to reset passwords without calling CSR? Passport owns branding:  Passport has many branding requirements and policies that we are subject to.  Most prominent is that during Passport creation, users must be aware of the fact that a Passport is being created on their behalf AND must be allowed to use an existing Passport if they choose.  Appropriate Passport logo must be displayed during the creation process and the user must accept the Passport ToU.  In addition, during logon, appropriate Passport logo must also be displayed.  In the case of XOS, however, our logon involves a  nickname  of sorts   the XName and via this name and the credentials, the user is logged on.  Because the name is not their Passport identity, Passport has agreed that we do NOT need to display Passport logo or branding during login, but if the actual Passport name/credential is referenced, the appropriate branding must be displayed. Issue:  Passport has a requirement that when we create the Passport, we must create it with the EASI credentials in place.  We are trying to close on two things here.  First, do we have to create this when we create a Passport account with only XBox credentials?  Why?  And second, are we required to show them these credentials (EASI) during this time even if the user did not ask for it? Issue:  Passport logo to display during account creation must be finalized and static. TCR:  Publishers should NEVER mention Passport or else they are subject to Passport branding issues. Passport ToU:  Passport has their own ToU that a user must accept before we create their Passport for them.  We (XBox Online) will also have our own.  We will roll-up these two ToUs into one and the user must accept that single ToU.  Note also that the Passport ToU may change over time and so we will have to update this periodically   as with ours.  KarenCS owns this process as well as the ToU itself. Terms and Definitions To avoid confusion, the following section defines terms to be used in the rest of the document. XBox Online (XO) Service (XOS):  The service built by the XBox Online team.  Includes matchmaking, buddy lists, billing, content download, authc and authz functionality, etc. XName: A name selected by the user to identify themselves to the XO community.   In the format of nickname@zone. Issue:  The actual format of the XName has not been finalized. User Account Database (UADB):  The central repository of all the information regarding XOS including user information, machine information, and offerings. Passport account:  a user s identity and all information associated with that identity.  Each Passport account has a unique Passport User ID (PUID). Credential:  a username/password duple that is used to authenticate an account XBox credential:  the XName/key duple that is used to authenticate the XBox Online user from the XBox PC/EASI credential:  the sign-in name (email name)/password pair used to authenticate a user when a user goes to a Passport site on their PCs. Authentication (authc): The process of proving an entity (machine, user, server, etc.) is who it claims to be. Kerberos:  a standard authentication protocol Ticket:  a unit of information.  In the context of Kerberos, it may be used as proof of a user s identity (user ticket) and/or the access requirement for resources   similar to the ticket you get at a movie theatre allows the bearer access into the theatre itself   this ticket may be referred to as the service ticket and usually has no identifier for the bearer.  A combination of the user ticket and the service ticket is the authentication and authorization mechanism. User ticket: a ticket that identifies the user.  It is the proof that the user is who they say they are.  For example, a driver s license would be considered such a ticket. Combined ticket:  in XOS, there comes a time when it is advantage to combine user tickets into a single ticket.  This single ticket represents the sum of all the users that was used in the combination process.  This new, single ticket, which holds the identities of multiple users is the entity ticket. Service ticket:  a ticket that grants access the bearer access to a specific service/resource.  It only says that the bearer has access   it says nothing about the user itself.  A movie ticket (again no identification of the bearer) grants the bearer of said ticket access to the theatres.  A movie ticket is an example of a service ticket. Key Distribution Center (KDC):  a Kerberos server that distributes tickets/keys based on users identity and/or their request Ticket Granting Server (TGS):  a Kerberos server that distributes tickets for other services Authentication Server (AS):  a Kerberos server that authenticates users/accounts Authorization (authz): The process of granting an entity (machine, user, server, etc.) rights to access resources. Authentication and Authorization (Auth/Z):  as the two systems are very tightly integrated, they will sometimes be referred together as a single system. Service: specific functionality of XOS provided by a given site.    XBox Online services include matchmaking, buddy lists, content referral service, and others. Site: a collection of front-end servers that handles incoming requests for one or more services.  Typically a publisher will have a single site to service all of its services.   Sites have a single shared secret with the XBox TGS for issuing tickets. Scenarios This section describes the scenarios that will be support by the AUTH/Z: Single user sign-on Duncan Smithe, a 22 year old gamer, has purchased a new online game   The Dungeons of Qatar.  He is anxious to play this game and goes home and loads it into his XBox.  Because online is best part of this game, he immediately goes to the online section.  At once he is asked to login   he selects his username on the screen and is prompted to enter his password protection PIN.  He does so and the screen shows him clips of what is going to be available to him after he is online.  In moments, he is online and is playing with his friends from Walla Walla. Multi-user sign-on After a few days, Duncan has a few of his friends over for an XBox party.  They all bring their MUs except for Bryce who is a close friend of Duncan and has his account on Duncan s machine because he comes over very often.  They load up Dungeons of Qatar and go online.  The logon screen appears and each of them selects their username and in turn enter in their respective PINs.  Malcolm forgets to insert his MU and realizes his account isn t on the screen.  Duncan points this out to Malcolm and gives him a whack to the head.  Malcolm inserts his MU and sees his username appear instantly, selects it and enters his PIN.  Again, the attract screen appears with animation as the 4 friends wait to be logged on.  Moments later, they are online playing with some fiendish creatures apparently from Spokane. Issue:  There is still the issue that needs to be resolved in terms of  logoff.   That is, if I pull my MU out of the controller, does that constitute a logoff?  Or pull the controller?  If a re-insert happens   do we automatically re-logon if the same user or just do another cycle? Issue:  Logoff   do we really need this?  BoydM thinks so.  This is more UI work AND TCR. Issue:  Number of users per MU.  Need to resolve whether there s any problem with just 1 user per MU.  Simplifies a lot. Architecture Diagram The following diagram illustrates the specific interactions between the client the AA system.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure 1: XBox Online Authentication and Authorization System Issue:  AS Proxy.  To deal with Passport referrals (an AS request to the Passport KDC is  referred  to another KDC), we may need to build this.  It is not clear yet whether Passport will refer AS requests for the XBox credentials. Issue:  Are the request for AS and TGS to Passport to the same DNS name or different names? Issue:  Web face.  How will the web face do authentication?  Using Kerberos of regular Passport web login? Note that this entire process, authentication and authorization, occurs under one API   XOnlineLogon().  Also note the heavy dependency here on the authentication system.  If, for whatever reason, the client fails to authenticate, they cannot go further.  All precautions need to be taken to ensure that this should only happen in the most catastrophic of failures. Issue: Client side caching of Passport tickets.  We have not yet resolved the final design on how to cache the tickets.  NT is pushing back on the current design due to the sensitive nature of the tickets.  We are still trying to close. Design In this section, we go into detail regarding the specific API calls and what happens underneath the covers.  For simplicity and better understanding, we will break out authentication and authorization into two distinct parts   as they really are distinct. Issue:  We currently have an issue with using Passport PUIDs as the unique identifier OR SIDs as moving forward, Passport 3.x and beyond and federations, they will be using SIDs.  Our entire architecture is based around the assumption that the PUID uniquely identifies users in all of Passport.  This assumption may not be valid and we may need to revise our plans.  Worse case would be to use the SID instead of a PUID.  This is pending resolution with Passport. XBox Online Authentication (and Authorization) API Overview To make things extremely simple for the developers and the user, the API set for authentication is designed to abstract away all of the complexities of authentication and authorization.  In fact, because these two parts of the system are so tightly integrated, there is actually only one set of APIs   authentication.  The actually authorization work is done underneath the calls and the developer only has to deal with accessing the individual services   not having to request permissions to access them.  They call a single API that does both authentication and authorization for them.  The other APIs are for PIN management and service access. Function Memory Allocation Description XOnlineGetUsers Retrieves online users stored on the local hard drive or XMU. XOnlinePINStartInput  Allocates enough memory to hold previous input state. Creates a handle that can be used to collect PIN input. XOnlinePINDecodeInput Decodes gamepad input and transforms the result into a byte in the PIN code. XOnlinePINEndInput  Frees memory allocated in XOnlinePINStartInput Ends the PIN input process and releases the memory associated with the handle.  XOnlineLogon Yes - Allocates enough memory to hold information for all logged on services Logs on to the online system on behalf of the specified users and obtains tickets for the specified services. XOnlineTitleUpdate  but is freed after the Asynchronous task is completed. Downloads an updated version of this game title and reboots. XOnlineGetServiceInfo Retrieves name, IP, and port of a logged on online service. Issue:  Should XOnlineTitleUpdate here?  Or should it be in the auto-update spec? Getting User Accounts Before the title can authenticate a user, it must figure out which user(s) to use for authentication.  User accounts exist on an XBox HD or on XMUs.  The title must enumerate through the HD and all attached MUs to ascertain the user choices it has.  This is done via an API call, XOnlineGetUsers.  Once it has this list of users, it will display this for the users to choose from.  Note that it will have to remember which controller chose which account in order to authenticate properly. TCR:  Are there any TCRs or custom practices today that force titles to do specific things when MUs are pulled/inserted during this process?  Do names just go off the list when the MU is pulled or appear when MUs are inserted? UI:  We will probably need req/ref UI here to dictate that this process is semi-similar for all games and consistent. Issue:  Account names as they are stored on the HD and MU are different than the names that the titles will be displaying.  We need to finalize on the difference (based on accounting spec) and decide whether we need to expose new API for displaying or whether XOnlineGetUsers will return the appropriate names. PIN Management Users will have the option to password protect their accounts using a PIN.  The existence of a PIN will be indicated within the account structure.  If the REQUIRED_PIN flag is set, the title developer MUST ask the user who selected that account to enter in the PIN.  The title MUST not use that account until the correct PIN is used for that account.  Note that the PIN is NOT the password.  Similar to the PINs on smartcards, the PIN is used to protect the password.  The user has no knowledge of the password nor do they need to have it just like smartcards. Issue:  PIN length? TCR:  Do we need to make it a TCR that when a controller has selected a user, all other controllers are blocked out until the controller that made the selection has entered the PIN, either correctly or incorrectly? UI:  There needs to be ref/req UI for PIN entering. Logon (and much more) The bulk of the work for authentication and authorization is done within one API call, XOnlineLogon.  Once the title has gathered the necessary users and has verified PINs on all the accounts that will be used, it uses this API to logon to the XOS with the selected users.  When doing so, it also requests for the services that it would like access to.  These services could be Matchmaking, buddies, content download, and any future ones.  If all goes well and smoothly, the users will be authenticated and access to the requested services will be granted. Authentication   who are you? The following is a detailed description of what happens when XOnlineLogon is called.  Note   this only describes the authentication part of XOnlineLogon. The Xbox checks to see if a machine account exists for this machine. If so, it goes to step 2. If not, it will create a machine account for this XBox via MACS.  For more information, please refer to the Machine Account Creation spec.  Note   if it fails here, appropriate error should be returned and the title needs to handle this. Issue:  Can a machine account be deleted from the Passport DB?  If so   what s the error code?  Do we need to support this?  Do we re-create via MACS? The Xbox does a DNS name resolution on  passport.xbox.com , and opens a TCP connection to the KDC at  passport.xbox.com  port 88. Xbox sends an AS request for the machine account, and an AS request for each logged on user, to the passport KDC. The target for all these requests is the TGS on the passport KDC.  Note that if there are multiple users, then multiple requests will have to be made of course. Issue:  Are there any special PA that we send with the initial AS request? The Xbox sends a TGS request to the Passport KDC using the machine account TGT, and piggy backs the remaining TGTs in the PA-WITH-IDENTITY. The target of this request is a cross realm TGT to the  xbox.com  KDC. The returned TGT contains a PAC section with the PUID and Credential Type of the machine account and all the user accounts.  This returned TGT is also known as the entity ticket. At this point, authentication is complete   that is, all the accounts have had their identities proven, machine and users alike.  The XBox has a ticket that is proof of all the identities. Issue:  I have left out the AS proxy until we resolve the issue of whether we need it.  If we do, we will need to update this and the diagram to include the AS proxy. Authorization   what can you have access to? Once the entity (machine and users logging on) have been authenticated, it is time to figure out whether the entity has access to the services requested.  This process is known as the authorization phase and is detailed here. The Xbox does a DNS name resolution on  kdc.xbox.com , and opens a TCP connection to the KDC at  kdc.xbox.com  port 88. The Xbox sends a TGS request to the Xbox KDC using the TGT (entity ticket) obtained previously and requests TKTs to the security gateway for multiple Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth section is included in the request to specify the services requested. The Xbox KDC returns a ticket to the security gateway of a certain Xbox   that provides some (or all) of the requested Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section is included in the reply to specify which services are serviced at this site, as well as the IP address of the site and the port of each service that is supported. The PUIDs from the PAC section of the incoming TGT as well as a list of the services that can be serviced using this TKT is sealed in the auth-data of the TKT.  For information on how the XKDC determines who has access to what, please refer to the server spec for the XKDC. The Xbox client repeats the previous two steps until it has TKTs to all the sites needed to provide all the requested services. Note that some services may be rejected due to policy checks on the Xbox KDC and un-authorized access. The Xbox client uses the TKTs obtained to construct AP-REQ and AP-REP messages that are used to authenticate key exchange packets during setup of the IPSEC security association with Xbox security gateways. The IP address of the security gateways were obtained from the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section in the TGS reply in the previous steps. The auth data sealed in the TKTs is forwarded from the security gateways to the backend services. At this point, the client has an entity ticket that is basically proof of all the users currently playing on that machine and the machine itself.  In addition, it has service tickets to the individual services it requested (assuming it was not denied because of policy, un-authorization, and/or service failure).  The process of authentication and authorization is now complete.  The client can go ahead and use the services it has requested access to and have been granted access to. Resource authorization Granting a user / entity access to a specific service does not necessarily guarantee the entity access to all the resources available on that service.  For example, an entity may have access to the downloading service but may not be allowed to download all the specific items for that service.  This finer grain of authorization is not dealt with at the ticket level for it would be too difficult to manage and a waste of resource to do so.  Access to individual resources within a specific service will be dictated by the service itself, however, a framework is in place to give the service enough information to determine whether or not to grant access to a specific resource. The properties of a user s subscription can be accessed on the client by calling XOnlineGetOfferingParameterValues(), with the id of the parameter they re interested in.  This returns a list of the values for the requested parameter, according to the offering(s) the user is currently subscribed to.   They can also call XOnlineVerifyOfferingParameterValue() with both a parameter id and value to check, which will return a positive result if the user has the given parameter/value pair in their list of properties. Similarly, a server can call GetUserOfferingParameterValues with the parameter they query or GetUserHasOfferingParameterValue with both a parameter and value.   This should provide the same information as the corresponding client APIs, and supports server-based authorization of the same functionality.   The definition and application of the properties is service-specific; the functionality of the billing service only sees it as a series of name/value pairs associated with an offering.  Example application   service functionality As an example, consider this theoretical subscription offering: Bronze Subscription Offering Services Matchmaking Buddy lists Content download Properties  Max # of people in buddy list: 10 Content: Tony Hawk NY track Content: Tony Hawk SF track If a user, who is a subscriber to this offering, wants to use his buddy list, the title calls XOnlineLogon(), specifying the buddy list service as one of the services.  On the server, the TGS checks the user_subscriptions table is checked to ensure the user has subscribed to an offering that includes access to the buddy list service.  If it does, a ticket to the buddy list service is included in the returned ticket.  Now say the user wants to add people to his buddy list.   However, the buddy list API knows there might be a configurable limitation on the number of people he can add, depending on the offering the user is subscribed to.   So, the client calls XOnlineGetOfferingParameterValues(Max # of people in buddy list).  This does a round-trip to the server, checks the offerings listed in user_subscriptions for the Max # of people in buddy list parameter, and returns the value of 10.   The client is then able to allow the additional members, or if he s at the max, encourage an upgrade.   (Note: this same authz check could be done by the buddy service on the server via soap, in lieu of (or in conjunction with) the client check.) If, at some later date, marketing decided people who have bronze packages typically have more than 10 friends, they can increase it to the desired count without requiring further changes. Example application   content purchases s say the user has a subscription to the bronze offering above.    He also purchases the following map offering: Tony Hawk Space Track Properties Content: Tony Hawk London track This adds the corresponding offer_id to user_subscriptions, which effectively adds this map (specifically, the package_id of the map) to the list of content the user can access.    Now, if the title were to call XOnlineGetOfferingParameterValues(Content), it would receive ids for the  Tony Hawk NY track , the  Tony Hawk SF track , and the  Tony Hawk London track .  This might be useful if Tony Hawk is displaying a list of content available to the user for download.      Alternatively, it can verify the rights to the London Track by calling XOnlineVerifyOfferingParameterValue(Content, Tony Hawk London Track).     (NOTE: this might be called as a part of XOnlineVerifyContent(), but the application is the same).  Interesting case   title update An interesting case that will arise is that during the authorization process   the title needs to be updated for whatever reason.  When the call reaches the XKDC during the authorization process, the XKDC may realize (irrespective of the users logging on) that the title needs to be updated.  In this case, the authorization fails with ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE.  The game title will need to download an update before any online game playing for this title can occur. The way to do that is to call XOnlineTitleUpdate. XOnlineTitleUpdate will download the updated binaries for this game title onto the hard drive and reboot the Xbox. Upon reboot, title will automatically apply the update to the game title and the game should be able to successfully logon from then on (at least until the next update is released).  Unfortunately, users will have to re-enter their PINs and do account selection all over again.  Before calling XOnlineTitleUpdate, the game title should inform the player that an update is about to happen and that the Xbox will reboot after the update. The player should have the option to NOT update at this time and possibly proceed playing the game without any online functionality. Note that XOnlineTitleUpdate can only occur after a failed XOnlineLogon attempt. Titles should not directly call it without first calling XOnlineLogon, nor should they call it if XOnlineLogon returned anything other than ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE. TCR:  Would this be a TCR? Is there anyway to test this? Issue:  Auto update is returned by the KDC right?  Does this mean that there s a TCR that says you must request AU service on all calls? Working with individual services After a successful logon call, the appropriate IP addresses and ports of the services requested and granted will be available to the titles.  They can then access these services directly or use the set of service APIs (XRLs) provided to use said services and manipulate them as necessary.  For more information, please refer to the individual services  specs and the XRL spec. Security Security is obviously a huge concern for the authentication and authorization system.  As this is our first and last line of defense against attacks, we will need to be vigilant on the attacks that XOS is vulnerable to.  This section will be living and will be updated as necessary and appropriate. Issue:  How likely are these scenarios and attacks.  Need that info here. Spoofing Identity Obviously user spoofing will need to be addressed if it comes up.  Areas of vulnerabilities: User credentials   the credentials are, of course, stored on the client box.  It is possible that these credentials can be stolen either from the box itself or an MU. Ticket cache   the ticket cache of the user s identity is also vulnerable to attack.  Hackers may be able to break into the box and steal the tickets.  This is of the same risk as stealing the actual credentials. Passport EASI credentials   our weakest link here would be the Passport EASI/PC credentials which are much short than our cryptographically strong key.  Though hackers may not be able to eavesdrop into the communication and steal the actual password, they may be able to brute force attack it and obtain it that way.  The password is short   currently Passport requires the password to be a minimum of six (6) characters in length. Tampering with Data Tampering with data is also a concern as the XBox is in the clients hands and in the hands of hackers, many things can be done. Destruction of data:  it is easy to wipe the XBox of its content and just a little bit harder to wipe the accounts   but not much harder.  This includes wiping out MUs as well of credentials. Passport EASI credentials   if a hacker knows the user s EASI credentials including password, they essentially own that account and can do a lot of damage   including deleting the account complete (including all credentials) from Passport, thereby creating a DoS attack against the user. Changing the data itself isn t that much of a threat as it doesn t really buy the hacker much.  However, if they can logon to the system (XOS) and tamper with server data, including billing info, stats, buddies, etc   it can be really destructive to the reputation of the service.  The way to do that is to steal an identity which is the previous point and we will need to trace all changes. Repudiability  An easy example of an attack would be if someone changed the billing information of a specific user and no system, user, administrator can figure out how it happened and who did it.  The way to counter repudiability is to make sure there is adequate logging and security of those log files so they do not get tampered with. Information Disclosure We need to be extremely careful with customer information especially credit card or billing information.  If at all possible, we should never store their CC information or billing information.  If we have to transport it, it must be encrypted and if stored, must also be encrypted.  We also need to be very careful with our name canonicalization.  This is a great way for a hacker to inadvertently get access to something they should not have access to   poor canonicalization.  Denial of Service (DoS) Perhaps the easiest to mount and the most difficult to defend against, our system, like any other, is susceptible to DoS attacks. Passport DoS   remember that if a user fails to authenticate for whatever reason, they are stopped in their tracks.  To do this, the attacker would have to attack the Passport KDCs or jam the communication lines by flooding it or otherwise, such as DNS entry spoofing.  This includes the AS Proxy if that were to be the case. XKDC DoS   our KDC is and will be out in the clear without protection.  It is vulnerable to numerous DoS attacks that can bring the server down.  We will need to make certain pre-cautions are made to ensure against known DoS attacks. DNS spoofing   we are very dependent on DNS to ascertain the correct location of various critical pieces of the system   Passport KDC (AS and TGS), XKDC, XMACS, AS Proxy (if present) Elevation of Privilege Not completely sure whether this attack affects us directly.  Of course, once a hacker has access to a system with an existing user account, they will try to elevate their privileges to do more damage.  We need to make sure that this is not the case and quarantine users off. Users   must not be allowed to jump off the box or have higher permissions than is absolutely necessary to do their work Admin   should have separate accounts and should not access the system via the same method as the users Logging   all activities should be logged to identify which user did what Customer Service When a user fails to logon for whatever reason, the support will come through XO, and not Passport (as noted in the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Policies"  Policies  section above).  As such, our CSR must be equipped to address these issues and if necessary escalate to the Passport team.  The owner for this section will be Sean Huberty [seanh], Barry Steinglass [barryste], and Karen Carter-Schwendler [karencs].   Operations This section is owned by an Operations Program Manager, but is written as a team effort by all members of the component team   PM, Dev, Test, & Ops. Events This section details all events that may be written to any of the OS event logs   primarily but not constrained to the System, Application, and Security logs. Events must be written at any point where a response is necessary from an resource external to the component.  Events are the triggers for actions   corrective or preventative, machine or human.  If an event does not directly trigger an action, consideration should be given as to whether there is a better way to provide the information. Events should contain enough information to be reasonably intuitive.  Events that do not utilize the description field are not intuitive. Event List: Event ID Source Category Description 50100 Information The Xbox KDC has started. Text Logging This section details the items that will be written to the text logs. Text logs are used as a record of interactions with Xboxes and other components of the Xbox Online service.  The text logs will be utilized for a number of purposes, including debugging and data mining. Text logs are not processed in real-time, therefore they cannot be used to trigger corrective or preventative action.  If that is necessary, an event should be written to the event log. Sample Text Log: #Xbox Online Log Version 1.0 #Date: 01-01-2002 09:00:00 #Logged By: server,servicename 00:00:01,10.1.1.1,xbox_id,player_id,match,game,gamemode,result Performance Counters This section details all performance counters that will be exposed by the component. Performance counters serve several purposes: Real-time monitoring Baselining and capacity planning Any item worthwhile of a performance counter should likely have more than one counter.  For instance, a Matchmaking server will have a counter for  Active Matchmaking Sessions .  Logical siblings would be  Average Active Matchmaking Sessions  and  Peak Active Matchmaking Sessions All APIs that affect eventing, text logging, or performance monitoring should be detailed here.  Examples include: SetTextLoggingMode(mode) Where mode = Default, Verbose, Debug ConsolidateEvents(event,duration) Where event = Event we want to consolidate to avoid log flooding And duration = how long consolidation should remain in effect Interactions All interactions with other components of the Xbox Online service should be called out here.  This includes the following: Other components that rely on this component Components that are relied upon by this component In each case, the effect of a failed interaction should be described. Usability Issues Call out issues that need to be determined by usability or other testing. External use This section should cover if/how the feature can be hosted, supported, or maintained by third parties.  For example, can a game publisher host their own content download servers and if so   How? What technologies are required?  Do we give then code? Etc. Dependencies The XBox Online Authentication system is completely dependent on Passport and their work.  In particular, XBox Credentials in Passport accounts:  XBox Online is dependent on Passport multiple credential support.  The PC credentials are too weak (cryptographically) to ensure that a brute force attack won t break the key and hence impersonate a user.  As such, Passport has created and supports an XBox credential for each account where we can specify a specific XName and more importantly a lengthy key as a password.  The XBox uses this XName/Key pair to authenticate with Passport. Passport (AS) KDC:  XBox Online uses Kerberos v5 as the method of authentication.  As such, we are dependent on the Passport KDC to correctly authenticate XBox Online users using their XBox credentials. Passport (TGS) KDC:  Because we will be authenticating multiple entities (machine + user OR machine + multiple users), we will want to combine these tickets into a single one for better management and smaller package size.  We are dependent on a Passport TGS that will combine up to 5 tickets (1 machine + 4 users) into a single ticket to be returned to the XBox for authorization purposes. Issue:  We will need to focus on and deal with Passport Federation support. International There is a very strict guideline dictated by Passport regarding the credentials.  All Passport credentials (usernames only) are restricted to the character set that is defined for email names in RFC 822.  Simply stated, you can only use the following characters for the user name of any Passport credential: !, #, $, %, &, ', *, +, -, ., /, 0 to 9, =, ?, A to Z, ^, _, `, a to z, {, |, }, ~ Note that the   is legal, but is a special character reserved to separate the name from domain.  Also note that the comma (,) is not legal and is used to separate legal characters above. Because the XName is directly translated to the Passport name, the XName also bears these restrictions.  In fact, should we choose to use a special character to delineate name from kingdom, we would need to further restrict the set of characters a user can choose for their XName. There are, however, no restrictions placed on the character set for the actual password.  This may cause many UI issues as the character set of the virtual keyboard of the XBox is limited.  We should advise that passwords that a user enters should come from the character set that is supported by our UI. Also   there are no restrictions placed on the in-game nicknames.  Titles MUST be aware that if they allow MBCS characters, that when matchmaking or going across language boundaries that the games can display these characters. Terms Note that when a user uses a Passport account, they must accept the Passport Terms of Use.  This happens during sign-up and the user MUST be informed of this and they MUST accept.  Otherwise they will not be allowed to used Passport and hence cannot use the XOS. Issue:  Is there a global ToU or are there different ones per country? User Interface The UI must support the character set that is specified above and may even specify a subset so that we can use the characters as special characters.  In addition, when the user enters their password, that their password character set must also be displayable. Issue:  Do we want to use the entire subset?  We still need to determine from Passport what is the character set that they will be using?  Then we have to pick (from the accounts spec) what subset we want. Technical Certification Requirements Auth/Z TCRs come in many flavors   including pre-logon, logon, and post logon. Pre-logon These TCRs pertain to items that must be done before calling XOnlineLogon. Passport usage Requirement: Games MUST NOT refer to accounts as Passport accounts or refer to Passport in anyway without explicit permission from Microsoft Corporation and without direction from Microsoft Corporation on how to display correct branding and naming convention.  Account names should be referred to as XNames. Issue:  Or whatever the name is when we finally decide.  ( Objective Measure: During certification, we will inspect all strings and UI for such words. User enumeration Games MUST enumerate all users on the HD and attached MUs Requirement: Games MUST enumerate all users on the HD and the attached MUs.  If an MU is pulled or inserted during the enumeration screen, it must be updated according (users deleted/added). Objective Measure: During certification, MUs will be inserted/pulled during enumeration and the display must reflect accordingly. Once a user has been selected by one of the controllers, the display MUST change to GUEST OF <user> Requirement: The game must support GUEST accounts and GUEST can only be a GUEST of a logged on user.  Hence the GUEST user MUST NOT be displayed until an existing user has been selected.  The GUEST OF account MUST be in the same location on the display as the user it is to be a GUEST OF.  There can be multiple GUEST accounts so the first one will be GUEST1 OF and following that choice will be GUEST2 OF.  How many GUEST a game supports is up to the game. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually inspected for compliance. Multiple accounts Requirement: If multiple accounts are detected with the same identifier, games MUST display an error message indicating so and where the conflict exists.  The game should NOT continue until this is rectified (credentials erased from the HD or the MU removed or credentials erased from the MU).  Only ONE name should be shown. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually inspected for compliance. PIN Management Requirement: Once a user selects an account, the screen must clearly identify which account was chosen and which controller and player.  If an account PIN required flag is set in the accounts structure, the game MUST ask the user to enter in their PIN.  If the PIN fails to match, an error is displayed and the user is allowed to enter in the PIN again until they succeed or choose another account.  Otherwise the game MUST NOT continue.  Most importantly, the game MUST NOT call XOnlineLogon with an account where a PIN is required but was not entered in or was not entered in correctly. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually inspected for compliance. Logon Calling XOnlineLogon with the appropriate users Requirement: The game MUST collect all the appropriate users and their controller position and MUST call XOnlineLogon with the data structure filled accordingly.  It is the games responsibility to keep track of which user is on which controller.  Also   if a GUEST account is used during user selection, the game MUST fill in that slot of the XOnlineLogon structure with the account ID of GUEST of <user> account and indicate appropriately whether this is a GUEST and whether this is guest 1, 2, 3, Objective Measure: During certification this will be manually tested for compliance. Title Updates Requirement: During XOnlineLogon call, an error may be returned (ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE).  If this is returned, the game MUST display to the users that the game needs to be updated.  The users are given the choice to either update now OR play offline.  If user chooses to update now, title MUST call XOnlineTitleUpdate.  Otherwise, the game continues offline and will not go online. Issue:  Req/ref UI needed.  And correct string? Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually tested for compliance. Displaying errors and warnings Requirement: During XOnlineLogon call, many error/warnings may occur.  The game MUST display the appropriate error string to the user so that they are aware of what s happening. Objective Measure: During certification, we will test all error cases and ensure that the proper string was displayed during those times. Post Logon Logoff Logoff option Requirement: Games MUST support the user s option to  sign-out  of the game and thus they are no longer playing and their account status turns to  offline.   Their user ID will no longer be associated with that specific controller.  Users cannot logoff another user.  That is, when a user chooses to  sign-out  then it is the user on that specific controller that is signed-out   not any other user. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually inspected for compliance. Pulled MU Requirement: During game play, if a user pulls an MU containing the credentials of a currently logged on user, the game MUST inform the user of such an action and given the opportunity to re-insert the MU with the credentials OR sign-out.  If the user re-inserts the MU, the game continues for said user.  Otherwise the user chooses to sign-out and the game continues with others. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually inspected for compliance. Pulled controller Requirement: During game play, if a user pulls a controller containing an MU that contains a user currently logged in, the game MUST inform the user of such an action and given the opportunity to re-connect the controller.  Game play pauses until such action is rectified.  If the controller is re-connect with different MU or with different user credentials, the game MUST act as if the MU was pulled (see TCR above). Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually tested for compliance. VerifyContent User required for VerifyContent Requirement: If XOnlineVerifyContent fails with a specific error code (ER_USER_REQUIRED), the game MUST display the logon UI for a user to be selected and XOnlineLogon be called.  Once XOnlineLogon successfully returned, the game MUST call XOnlineVerifyContent again. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually tested for compliance. User invalid for VerifyContent Requirement: If XOnlineVerifyContent fails with a specific error code (ER_INVALID_USER), the game MUST display the logon UI for a user to be selected and XOnlineLogon be called for the selected user(s).  Once XOnlineLogon returns successfully, the game MUST call XOnlineVerifyContent again. Objective Measure: During certification, this will be manually tested for compliance. Required UI This section should outline all Required UI that the game developer will have to follow. Recommended Practices This section should outline the recommended practices that are not TCRs or Required UI, but still nice to consider. API Details This section covers the individual APIs in detail.  This is split into two sections, public and private.  Public APIs are exposed to title developers and used by them to access the service.  Private APIs are used within the XO group only and MUST not be published to title developers.  These APIs are used by other services and features within XOS. The following is a list of constants that are used throughout the online authentication system.  Please note these are subject to change. #define XONLINE_USERNAME_SIZE #define XONLINE_MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH XONLINE_USERNAME_SIZE - 1 #define XONLINE_USER_RESERVED_SIZE #define XONLINE_PIN_LENGTH #define XONLINE_LOCAL_HARD_DRIVE // Max number of users that can be authenticated in one logon request #define XONLINE_MAX_LOGON_USERS // Max number of users that can be stored on a local hard drive or XMU #define XONLINE_MAX_STORED_ONLINE_USERS The reason for having these rigid constants is so that the implementation can be simplified and use a deterministic amount of memory.  XBox Online Authentication APIs   public The following is a detailed list of the Online Authentication APIs that are exposed to publishers and title developers. XOnlineGetUsers A fixed set of online users (XONLINE_MAX_STORED_ONLINE_USERS to be exact) can have their information stored on the local Xbox hard drive or each XMU unit. The XOnlineGetUsers function is used to retrieve all of the online users that have their information stored on the local Xbox hard drive or on a particular XMU unit.  HRESULT XOnlineGetUsers ( IN CHAR chDrive, OUT PXONLINE_USER pUsers, OUT DWORD *pcUsers XOnlineGetUsers Parameters chDrive   A drive letter that corresponds to a mounted XMU. The MU must already be mounted before this API call. The MU can be unmounted after this call. If XONLINE_LOCAL_HARD_DRIVE is passed in, then the online users on the local hard drive will be enumerated instead of the users stored on an XMU unit. In such a case, no special mounting is required.  Multiple calls to this API will be necessary if the title developer wishes to enumerate accounts on both the local hard drive and the XMUs connected to the XBox. pUsers   Pointer to an array of online user structures that will be filled in with the online users during the call. There must be space for XONLINE_MAX_STORED_ONLINE_USERS users in the array. pcUsers   On completion of the function, *pcUsers will report the actual number of users filled into the array pointed to by pUsers. The structure for XONLINE_USER is defined as typedef struct { FILETIME lastLogon; ULONGLONG qwUserID; CHAR username[XONLINE_USERNAME_SIZE]; BYTE pin[XONLINE_PIN_LENGTH]; DWORD dwOptions; // Options read in from XOnlineGetUsers DWORD dwAuthorizationInfo; // Input/Output to/from XOnlineLogon BYTE reserved[XONLINE_USER_RESERVED_SIZE]; } XONLINE_USER, *PXONLINE_USER; lastLogon   the most recent local time that this particular user performed a successful logon on this Xbox. qwUserID   unique user identifier username - the unique online name associated with the online user pin - optional game pad key combination used to locally block out unauthorized access of the user.  dwOptions - field currently has one flag defined. #define XONLINE_USER_OPTION_REQUIRE_PIN 1 When the pin option is set, it means that the user has decided to require the PIN code before logging on. In such a case, the title MUST prompt the user for his/her pin and compare it with the   value returned in the XONLINE_USER structure by the user enumeration functions, and only when the pin matches, should the corresponding user be passed to XOnlineLogon. dwAuthorizationInfo   field currently has one flag defined. #define XONLINE_USER_IS_GUEST reserved   internal use only.  This should not be modified in any way. XOnlineGetUsers Return Value If the task was successful, S_OK is returned. Otherwise an appropriate HRESULT code is returned. The exact list of possible failure return codes is yet to be determined. Collecting User Input for PIN code If a user enables the optional PIN code for his/her account, the title will need to collect this PIN code from the user using the gamepad. In order to unify the way gamepad button presses are mapped to bytes in the PIN code, we provide a set of  APIs for decoding the PIN input from the user. XOnlinePINDecodeInput is the main routine that decodes the input state from the gamepad and determines if a new PIN code byte can be generated. This function must be called at a reasonable frequency so as to not lose any significant user input in the process. Because the process of determine whether a new PIN code has been entered involves examining both the current input state as well as the previous input state, a handle that is used to store the previous input state must be created using XOnlinePINStartInput and destroyed using XOnlinePINEndInput. The current plan in terms of mapping from button presses to a PIN code is as follows: A single press of a button will correspond to a particular byte code. The set of buttons that will be used has yet to be determined. Subsequent button presses, after the first button press, but before the release of all buttons, are ignored. A button will be considered pressed if the strength of the press on the button is above a certain threshold. All buttons must be fully released before the next button press can start. XOnlinePINStartInput The XOnlinePINStartInput function is used to start the PIN collection process for a particular gamepad. The current input state of the gamepad is passed in and a handle is returned for use by XOnlinePINDecodeInput and XOnlinePINEndInput. XPININPUTHANDLE XOnlinePINStartInput( IN PXINPUT_STATE pInputState; XOnlinePINStartInput Parameters  pInputState   The current input state collected from XinputGetState (See Xbox platform documentation for more details). The input state will not be modified in any way by this routine. XOnlinePINStartInput Return Value If the function succeeds, the return value is a valid handle that can be used by XOnlinePINDecodeInput and XOnlinePINEndInput. If the function fails, it returns NULL, essentially signaling  out of memory. XOnlinePINDecodeInput The XOnlinePINDecodeInput function is used to decode newly collected gamepad input and possibly return a byte that corresponds to a new PIN code that the user just entered. HRESULT XOnlinePINDecodeInput( IN XPININPUTHANDLE handle; IN PXINPUT_STATE pInputState; IN PBYTE pPINByte; XOnlinePINDecodeInput Parameters  handle   An XPININPUTHANDLE handle that was previously created with XOnlinePINStartInput. pInputState   A new input state that was collected from XinputGetState(See Xbox platform documentation for more details). The input state will not be modified in any way by this routine. pPINByte   Pointer to the location where the next byte in the PIN code should be written, if a new byte is detected. XOnlinePINDecodeInput Return Value If the new input state corresponds to a new byte being generated in the PIN code, then S_OK is returned, and the byte is written at the location pointed to by pPINByte. If the new input state does not represent a new byte in the PIN code, then S_FALSE is returned, and no byte is generated. For all other error situations, an appropriate HRESULT code will be returned. The exact list of possible failure return codes is yet to be determined. XOnlinePINEndInput The XOnlinePINEndInput function is used to end a gamepad PIN collection process, and release the corresponding memory. HRESULT XOnlinePINEndInput ( IN XPININPUTHANDLE handle; XOnlinePINEndInput Parameters  handle   An XPININPUTHANDLE handle that was previous created with XOnlinePINStartInput. XOnlinePINEndInput Return Value If the handle was closed successfully, S_OK is returned. Otherwise an appropriate HRESULT code is returned. The exact list of possible failure return codes is yet to be determined.  XOnlineLogon The XOnlineLogon function is used to start an asynchronous logon process which involves communicating with the authentication server to authenticate users using Kerberos and obtain tickets used for future communication with various requested online services. The service handles returned by this routine can be used in various online APIs. XOnlineLogon can be called again, but all service handles from the previous logon call will be lost. Therefore, we recommend titles to first collect all user information and service names ahead of time and only make one logon call. If the title supports adding or removing users midway through the game, then the title will need to call XOnlineLogon again with the new set of users.  Note that ALL previous service handles and socket connections will be lost.  Titles should prompt new users for their optional PIN code but not bother users that have already logged on. XOnlineLogon is NOT thread safe, thus titles should avoid making a second XOnlineLogon call before the first logon task is completed. HRESULT XOnlineLogon( IN PXONLINE_USER pUsers, IN PXONLINE_SERVICE pServices, IN DWORD cServices, IN HANDLE hEvent, OUT PXONLINETASK_HANDLE pHandle XOnlineLogon Parameters pUsers   Pointer to an array of XONLINE_USER structures that hold information about the users that are present at the console and would like to participate in the online game session. The array must be big enough to hold exactly XONLINE_MAX_LOGON_USERS number of users. The order of users in the array is significant and should map one to one to the 4 game controller ports. If a user is not present at a specific game port, then qwUserID should be 0. If the XONLINE_USER_OPTION_REQUIRE_PIN option is set for the user, the title should prompt the user for a PIN code and verify that the PIN is correct before attempting to logon the user. pServices   Pointer to an array of XONLINE_SERVICE structures that specify the list of services in which tickets will be obtained to enable future secure communication with the services. dwServiceID specifies the service ID of the service requested. Upon completion of the asynchronous logon process, the  handle  field will be filled with an XSERVICEHANDLE that can be used to specify a logged on service in various other routines. All services that will potentially be needed should be requested, to avoid another call to XOnlineLogon should a connection to that service be needed. // ServiceIDs #define XONLINE_PRESENCE_SERVICE ((DWORD)1) #define XONLINE_NOTIFICATION_SERVICE ((DWORD)2) #define XONLINE_CATALOG_REFERRAL_SERVICE ((DWORD)3) #define XONLINE_DOWNLOAD_SERVICE ((DWORD)4) #define XONLINE_MATCHMAKING_SERVICE ((DWORD)6) #define XONLINE_BILLING_SERVICE ((DWORD)7) #define XONLINE_USER_PROFILE_SERVICE ((DWORD)8) #define XONLINE_INVALID_SERVICE ((DWORD)0xFFFFFFFF) typedef struct { DWORD dwServiceID; HRESULT hr; XSERVICEHANDLE handle; } XONLINE_SERVICE, *PXONLINE_SERVICE; cServices   Number of services in the service array pointed to by pServices. hEvent   Handle to an event that will be signaled when there is work that needs to be performed on the created asynchronous task. The event will be left unsignalled if the task is currently blocked by an asynchronous operation. pHandle   Pointer to a handle that will be filled in with an XONLINETASK_HANDLE representing the newly created asynchronous task. The handle can then be passed to various XAsync routines to manipulate the asynchronous task. XOnlineLogon Return Value If the asynchronous task was created successfully, S_OK is returned. Otherwise an appropriate HRESULT code is returned. The exact list of possible failure return codes is yet to be determined. Note that if the asynchronous task was created successfully, the title developer must pass the handle to an XAsync routine to actually do work for the task.  Also note that even after the XAsync routine returns successfully, that is, logon is successful, the title must also continue to call the XAsync routine to do work on this asynchronous handle.  The title must check the return value of the XAsync routine to see if more work needs to be done and continue calling the XAsync routine if more work is needed.  This is necessary for the underlying system to maintain seamless authentication requirements for the title such as renewing tickets when necessary.  When the task handle finally is closed, all connections are dropped. The final HRESULT corresponding to the actual asynchronous task can be retrieved from the XONLINETASK_HANDLE after the task has been completed. The exact list of possible failure return codes here is yet to be determined. However, one possible error code is ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE. This is returned when this particular game title contains a flaw and an update needs to be downloaded before online game playing can proceed. XOnlineTitleUpdate If the asynchronous XOnlineLogon task finally returns ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE, the game title will need to download an update before any online game playing for this title can occur. The way to do that is to call XOnlineTitleUpdate. XOnlineTitleUpdate will download the updated binaries for this game title onto the hard drive and reboot the Xbox. Upon reboot, title will automatically apply the update to the game title and the game should be able to successfully logon from then on (at least until the next update is released). Before calling XOnlineTitleUpdate, the game title should inform the player that an update is about to happen and that the Xbox will reboot after the update. The player should have the option to NOT update at this time and possibly proceed playing the game without any online functionality. Note that XOnlineTitleUpdate can only occur after a failed XOnlineLogon attempt. Titles should not directly call it without first calling XOnlineLogon, nor should they call it if XOnlineLogon returned anything other than ER_NEED_TO_UPDATE. HRESULT XOnlineTitleUpdate( IN HANDLE hWorkEvent, OUT PXONLINETASK_HANDLE pHandle XOnlineTitleUpdate Parameters hWorkEvent   Handle to an event that will be signaled when there is work that needs to be performed on the created asynchronous task. The event will be left unsignalled if the task is currently blocked by an asynchronous operation. pHandle   Pointer to a handle that will be filled in with an XONLINETASK_HANDLE representing the newly created asynchronous task. The handle can then be passed to various XAsync routines to manipulate the asynchronous task. XOnlineTitleUpdate Return Value If the function succeeds, the return value is an XONLINETASK_HANDLE that can be used to proceed with the asynchronous task of updating the title. If the function fails, it returns INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE. Titles should call GetLastError() for additional details. If the download and update succeeded, then the asynchronous task will automatically reboot the Xbox, thus a successful return code will never be returned from the asynchronous task. Otherwise an appropriate HRESULT code is returned from the asynchronous task. The exact list of possible failure return codes is yet to be determined.  Obtaining Service Info and Ticket After a successful logon, the title can communicate with the various logged on services to perform the desired online functionality. We will provide XRL access routines to communicate with these services using HTTP.  Titles may also access the IP address and port of the service directly. XOnlineGetServiceInfo The XOnlineGetServiceInfo function provides the title developer with information about a logged on service. PXONLINE_SERVICE_INFO XOnlineGetServiceInfo( IN XSERVICEHANDLE serviceHandle The returned structure XONLINE_SERVICE_INFO is defined as: typedef struct { DWORD dwServiceID; DWORD dwServiceIP; wServicePort; wReserved; } XONLINE_SERVICE_INFO, *PXONLINE_SERVICE_INFO; Note that wReserved is for internal use only and should not be modified in any way. XOnlineGetServiceInfo Parameters serviceHandle   Handle to a service that was returned from an XOnlineLogon call. XOnlineGetServiceInfo Return Value A pointer to a fixed piece of memory that holds information about the online service is returned. This memory should never be modified by the title. The memory will become invalid when a new XOnlineLogon is performed. If an invalid handle is passed in, then the NULL pointer will be returned. XBox Online Authentication APIs   private The following APIs are used from within some of the APIs listed above and elsewhere within XOS.  These APIs are, however, not intended for publisher use.  They are targeted for internal use only. XOnlineHasMachineAccount XOnlineHasMachineAccount can be used to test whether a machine account has already been established for this Xbox.  If this function returns FALSE, then all online gaming functionality of the title should be disabled and not presented to the user. This function does not communicate with the server to verify if the account is currently valid, that should be accomplished by an XOnlineLogon call. BOOL XOnlineHasMachineAccount(); XOnlineHasMachineAccount Parameters This function has no parameters. XOnlineHasMachineAccount Return Value Returns TRUE if a machine account is present and FALSE otherwise.  Samples Each sample in the XDK should be described here. Miscellaneous Issues We will probably need a generic mechanism to notify users of downtime of the service.  So that they don t just instantly call CSR if they can t login.  How do we achieve this? KDC must support a force name change; return an error code that forces a reboot KDC must support an error code for being kicked and a way to retrieve when the user is re-enabled We should conduct a security review of the KDCs and the overall architecture, both for Passport and XBox Online. During user account creation, do we ask for secret question?  Do we need this later on? Make sure the system supports quick launch   some games have this thing where they boot into the dvd do something (like login) and then reboot onto the XBE on the HD   we want to make sure we don t have to redo the auth all over again. Kicking   temporary disabled use of the XOS.  If we need this for launch, there is more work here for the XKDC.  It needs to return an error code and expose get another API to retrieve info about this specific error   you have been kicked and for how long. Any parts of the feature that are cut from the spec should be moved to this section for consideration in future releases.

Owner Functional Group Alias Program Management Van Van vanvan Development Tony Chen Gary Thompson Larry Ohab tonychen garyt lohab Tristan Jackson Dan Rosenstein David Hefner Aaron lieberman Tristanj Danrose davidhef aaronlie Overview This document describes the Kerberos protocol detail used to authenticate and authorize Xbox consoles and Xbox users for the purpose of providing secure online services for the Xbox. This document assumes the reader is familiar with the Kerberos authentication protocol (The Windows 2000 Kerberos Authentication White Paper is good reading material for understanding Kerberos). This document also assumes the reader is familiar with the general Xbox authentication mechanism and what the MACS Server, UACS Server, and the Xbox KDC each do, and why they exist. The document only describes implementation details that do not show up in other spec. The latest Kerberos RFC (draft 9 of the RFC 1510 replacement) will be referenced by this document. Kerberos Message Exchanges In this section, we give an outline of the Kerberos message exchanges that happen during Xbox Kerberos logon when XOnlineLogon is called. The Xbox checks to see if a machine account exists for this machine. If so, it goes to step 2. If not, a DNS resolution on  macs.xboxlive.com  is performed and the MACS KDC is contacted to obtain a machine account for the Xbox. The Xbox does a DNS name resolution on  as.xboxlive.com , and opens a UDP socket to the KDC at  as.xboxlive.com  port 88. Xbox sends several sequential AS request for all the users attempting to logon to build up a TGT containing the compound identities of all the users. The target for this TGT is the krbtgt at the passport.net realm. All but the very first request will contain a PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth containing the previous TGT. If no users are logging on, this step is ommited. The Xbox sends a final AS request to the AS KDC using the machine account, and includes the TGT obtained in step 3 in the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth. The target of this request is a cross realm TGT to the  xbox.com  KDC. The returned TGT contains a PAC section with the PUID and Credential Type of the machine account and all the user accounts. The Xbox does a DNS name resolution on  tgs.xboxlive.com , and opens a UDP socket to the KDC at  tgs.xboxlive.com  port 88. The Xbox sends a TGS request to the Xbox KDC using the TGT obtained in step 4 and requests TKTs to the security gateway for multiple Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth section is included in the request to specify the services requested. The Xbox KDC returns a ticket to the security gateway of a certain Xbox   that provides some (or all) of the requested Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section is included in the reply to specify which services are serviced at this site, as well as the IP address of the site and the port of each service that is supported. The PUIDs from the PAC section of the incoming TGT as well as a list of the services that can be serviced using this TKT is sealed in the auth-data of the TKT. The Xbox client repeats step 6 and 7 until it has TKTs to all the sites needed to provide all the requested services. Note that some services may be rejected due to policy checks on the Xbox KDC. The Xbox client uses the TKTs obtained to construct AP-REQ and AP-REP messages that are used to authenticate key exchange packets during setup of the IPSEC security association with Xbox security gateways. The IP address of the security gateways were obtained from the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section in the TGS reply obtained in step 7. The auth data sealed in the TKTs is forwarded from the security gateways to the backend services. General Kerberos Issues Kerberos Principal Names User accounts will be like username.kingdom@xbox.com where username is picked by the user, and kingdom is selected from a list of available kingdoms. The term  kingdom  in this document has been changed to  realm  in most of the source code and UI. However, throughout this document, we will still refer to is as kingdom to avoid confusion with the  Kerberos realm . Again the name is one component and of name type will be KRB_NT_ENTERPRISE_PRINCIPAL (10). Again, the realm name is currently set to  passport.net , but it is returned by the UACS, and will not be hard coded by the client. Machine accounts have Kerberos principle names like NNNNNNNNNNNN._machine@xbox.com where NNNNNNNNNNNN will be replaced with the real 12 digit serial number of the Xbox. The principle will be represented as one Kerberos principle name component with the KRB_NT_ENTERPRISE_PRINCIPAL (10) name type. The realm is currently set to be  passport.net , however the client will use whatever realm is returned by the MACS KDC and will not hard code the realm name. Name canonicalization will be requested on all Kerberos KDC requests, where all user and machine principals should be canonicalized to a one component SID string with the name type KRB_NT_UID (5). The principal name for the Xbox KDC will conform to Kerberos standard and be of name type KRB_NT_SRV_INST (2) with 2 components:  krbtgt  and  xbox.com . The realm name will be whatever the realm name of the machine account is (most likely  passport.net The principal name for the various Xbox services will be of the name type KRB_NT_SRV_INST (2) with 2 components:   and  , where N is the number of the service in decimal, and   stands for security gateway. The realm name of the service will be hard coded into the client as  xbox.com When the client requests a ticket for a set of services, the response it gets back is a ticket for the security gateway of a   that performs the service. The principal name for a site will be of the name type KRB_NT_SRV_INST (2) with 2 components:   and  siteN , where N is the number of the site in decimal. The realm name of the site will be returned by the KDC and will usually be  xbox.com Optional Kerberos Fields The following Kerberos optional fields will be omitted: All fields related to Host Addresses All ticket extension related fields In authenticator: Sequence numbers (also omitted in AP-REP) Authorization-data Subkey In KDC-REQ-BODY From Time Rtime Enc-authorization-data Additional-tickets In EncKDCRepPart Key-expiration Start time Renew-till KDC Options and AP Options The following KDC options will be requested in KDC requests: Canonicalize (15) The following AP options will be requested in AP requests: Mutual required (2) Encryption Algorithm The only encryption system the Xbox client will support is the  RC4-HMAC  crypto system. The only checksum system used is the MD5 checksum. All keys and checksums will be 16 bytes long. Unicode Passwords are hashed to 16 byte Keys using MD4. However, the client does not examine the encryption method used to encrypt the tickets; it is up to the various KDCs and Xbox services to determine the encryption system of the tickets. For now we are only using RC4-HMAC for ticket encryption also. Addition Pre-Auth Information Several new pre-auth types have been added to perform the extra tasks needed during Xbox logon. All of these pre-auth structures are encrypted with the session key in the TGT if it is in a TGS request, otherwise they will be encrypted with the client key. A different encryption salt is used for each of these pre-auth structures. All of these pre-auth structures are direct in memory structures with all multi-byte fields being in little endian format. Client Side Ticket Caching All Tickets and associated session keys retrieved from either KDC will be cached to the Xbox had drive. This will make it unnecessary to contact either the AS KDC or the TGS KDC unless the required final tickets to talk to the security gateways have expired. We are doing this because the original machine and user keys used to obtain these tickets are stored on disk anyway, and anybody that could steal the session key associated with an expiring ticket could just as easily steal the original key for the machine or user account. Also, as an added security measure, we will be encrypting these session keys with any keys that were used to obtain the corresponding ticket (like user keys and machine keys) before we store the session key on the hard drive. This means that a ticket cached by a visiting user on an XMU will be useless once the XMU has been removed. This ticket caching scheme will greatly reduce the amount of traffic all Xbox s generate to either KDCs, and decrease the logon latency. This is especially needed since (unlike a PC) people typically reboot their game console many times during a day. The client side code will automatically retrieve new tickets from the AS KDC when 50% of the lifetime of the existing ticket has expired. If a new ticket cannot be retrieved from KDC at that time, the old ticket will continue to be used and this process will be repeated again the next time a logon occurs. This 50% renewal process will NOT be performed on TGS requests. Clock Synchronization Clock synchronization is dealt with in the normal Kerberos fashion. When the time in the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP is off by more than 5 minutes, the KDC reports Kerberos error number 0x25. The client then automatically corrects its UTC time with the supplied correct time in the error message, and retries again. Because the Xbox manages the time zone of the console, the effect the end user will observe is that the Xbox clock is automatically corrected every time the console goes online. We must make sure the clock time of the AS KDC and the TGS KDC as well as the time on the security gateways must all be relatively in sync. Ticket Lifetime The lifetime of the TGTs retrieved from the AS KDC will be 30 days. This long time period is justified because these TGTs are only used to obtain real tickets from the Xbox KDC, and that process will check for account lockouts and various other issues. Thus the 30 day limit will not permit banned users or machines from gaining unlimited access for 30 days. This longer ticket lifetime will also enable the client ticket cache to more drastically reduce the amount of AS KDC traffic. The lifetime the tickets issued by the Xbox KDC will be a function of the service requested and the game title, but will typically be 1 day. Ticket Renewal We will not support ticket renewal using the regular Kerberos ticket renewal process. Instead, in the rare case where a ticket has expired, the Xbox will simply request new tickets. The standard Kerberos ticket renewal mechanism is not used.  MACS Server Details Important Structures and Constants #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION   203 #define KERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION_SALT  1203 typedef struct _XKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION     ULONGLONG qwUserID;     CHAR gamertag[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE]; // NNNNNNNNNNNN     CHAR realm[XONLINE_REALM_SIZE]; // _machine     CHAR domain[XONLINE_USERDOMAIN_SIZE]; // xbox.com     CHAR realm[XONLINE_REALM_NAME_SIZE]; // passport.net     BYTE key[XONLINE_KEY_LENGTH]; // The MD4 hashed key, not the password } XKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION, *PXKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION; Xbox Machine Account Creation Before any online authentication of users can be performed, an Xbox machine account needs to be created in order to bootstrap the Xbox online authentication process. For Xbox machine accounts, we need to make sure that it really is an Xbox attempting to create the account and not a PC pretending to be an Xbox. To prevent arbitrary computers from creating Xbox online accounts, we generate a random  online key  during Xbox manufacturing, and the Xbox serial number along with the online key will function as the pre-shared key between the Xbox and the KDC during machine account creation. We will be using a Kerberos AS request cycle to the MACS KDC Server to perform the machine account creation. Xbox machine account creation is performed as follows: The Xbox does a DNS lookup on  macs.xboxlive.com  and opens a UDP socket to the MACS KDC at port 88. The Xbox sends a KRB_AS_REQ to the Xbox MACS KDC. The principal name used will be  NNNNNNNNNNNN  as one name component of type KRB_NT_ENTERPRISE_PRINCIPAL (10). A PA-CLIENT-VERSION pre-auth is included. The realm used is  macs.xbox.com . The target requested is krbtgt/macs.xbox.com at realm  macs.xbox.com The MACS KDC will then lookup the pre-shared key for that particular Xbox serial number in the genealogy database. The MACS KDC then checks with the UODB database to determine whether a new machine account needs to be created, whether the account exists and a password set should be performed, or whether the account is banned due to some policy. If the account is not banned, the pre-shared key is retrieved from the nCipher device and the key is returned to the KDC core. After the KDC core verifies that the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP checks out alright, it requests the generation of the PA-XBOX-ACCOUNT-CREATION pre-auth. At this point the MACS KDC obtains a PUID to the newly created machine account in the Passport.net realm from the UODB PUID generator. If during an account creation request we detect that the account already exists, the account password should simply be reset. After the account has been created, the new PUID and the new Xbox key will be sent to the UODB to record the account reset time and the PUID and key of the new account. The MACS KDC sends an AS reply back containing the PA-XBOX-ACCOUNT-CREATION pre-auth. This pre-auth is encrypted in the pre-shared online key. Note that the MD4 hashed key and not the password is returned in the pre-auth structure. The TGT sent back in the reply is totally ignored and the pre-auth in the reply is decrypted to reveal the new account information. The new machine account information is recorded in the Xbox hard drive, and if all goes well, the MACS KDC will never be contacted by this Xbox again. The key for the krbtgt/macs.xbox.com principal should be randomly generated every time a request is made. This is to guarantee that the ticket issued could never be used to do anything. Policies Enforced Only the first request creates a new machine account, the remaining requests only reset the Xbox key for the Xbox with that serial number. If any machine has already created an account, then only a key reset will only be allowed. If any machine account is blocked, then the MACS request will fail. An in memory MRU Cache will be used to prevent DOS attacks against the MACS KDC. This MRU cache will also prevent a UDP retry on the very first account creation attempt to cause a key reset, thus modifying the key without the client taking the key modification into account. AS KDC Details The purpose of the AS exchange is to authenticate each machine and user account and to get a compound cross realm ticket to krbtgt/xbox.com at the same time.

Xbox sends several sequential AS request for all the users attempting to logon to build up a TGT containing the compound identities of all the users. The target for this TGT is the krbtgt at the passport.net realm. All but the very first request will contain a PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth containing the previous TGT. If no users are logging on, this step is omitted. The Xbox sends a final AS request to the AS KDC using the machine account, and includes the TGT obtained in the previous step in the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth. The target of this request is a cross realm TGT to the  xbox.com  KDC. The returned TGT contains a PAC section with the PUID and Credential Type of the machine account and all the user accounts. The AS requests will be sent sequentially one after another. The PA-CLIENT-VERSION pre-auth is included. It basically contains the XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING (after being correctly filled in) encrypted using the KdcRequestNonceHmacKey which is the result of an MD5HMAC of the KERB_KDC_REQ_NONCE_CKSUM_SALT and the KDC-REQUEST nonce using the client key. The PA-PAC-REQUEST-EX pre-auth will be included and the only PAC sections requested will be the PAC_CLIENT_IDENTITY and the PAC_COMPOUND_IDENTITY sections. The standard PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth will be included. Policies Enforced Client keys must be verified. The PUID of the account and the credential type used must be accurately recorded into the PAC section of the returned TGT. Tickets issued will expire in 30 days.

The following steps are carried out: Xbox sends Xbox KDC (located at DNS name  tgs.xboxlive.com ) a TGS request using the combined TGT that contains all the account PUIDs in the PAC section. It requests TKTs to the security gateway for multiple Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth section is included in the request to specify the services requested. Also contained in this pre-auth section is the list of user PUIDs currently being logged on.  The Xbox KDC compares the PUIDs from the PAC section of the incoming TGT with the PUIDs in the pre-auth section, and applies appropriate policy checks. The following are placed into the auth-data section of the issued TKT: The PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth in the same order as they were in the pre-auth. Xbox client specific information contained in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth. The most significant 3 bytes in dwUserFlags is filled in based on information looked up from the UODB. The LSB will be left as zero. The most significant WORD should be copied from si_ticket_flags in the t_users table. The least significant bit in that word is used to determine whether the user is voice banned or not. That bit should be set if the sd_voice_unlock_date date is greater than now. The third most significant byte should be copied from ti_country_id in the t_users table. The list of services that can be serviced using this TKT. The auth-data is signed using the pre-shared key for the destination site by applying an MD5HMAC operation on the XKERB_AD_XBOX portion of the auth data using the pre-shared key (auth-data signing in Apr SDK). The Xbox KDC then returns the ticket for the security gateway for a certain Xbox   that provides some (or all) of the requested Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section is included in the reply to specify which services are serviced at this site, as well as the IP address of the site and the port of each service that is supported. An HR value is returned for each requested service that reports whether the service can be accessed using the returned ticket or whether the service is at another site, or whether the access to the service is not allowed altogether. Also included in this pre-auth is a DWORD (dwUserFlags in XUID) containing info on each user, along with an HRESULT value for each and every user. The DWORD in dwUserFlags has the exact same value as the DWORD dwUserFlags placed in the auth-data of the ticket. The Xbox client repeats steps 1 through 5 until it has TKTs to all the sites needed to provide all the requested services. Note that some services may be rejected due to policy checks on the Xbox KDC. The KDC will continue to issue tickets to granted services, even though some requested services are not granted. Services that can be accessed with no user Tickets to the following service can be granted even when no user is present from the logon: User account creation service (UACS). Auto-update service. Message service. Basic subscription service (XBSS). Policies Enforced The following paragraphs describes the policies that should be enforced by the Xbox KDC when granting out tickets. First some general policies: Tickets granted should only be good for 1 day, and should NOT be forwardable, proxiable, or renewable. Make sure we return the minimal number of site tickets to satisfy the requested services. When any of the following policies are violated, no ticket is issued and Kerberos error is returned: Normal Kerberos checks on the PA-TGS-REQUEST pre-auth to test if the session key is correct as well as the timestamp being within the allowed range, is applied. The corresponding Kerberos error mentioned in the RFC is returned. If non-Xbox credential for any of the users (or machine) is used, KDC_ERR_POLICY is returned. If no service is requested or if the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth is not included, the Kerberos error of KDC_ERR_POLICY is returned. The Xbox KDC should make sure all PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST are authentic by checking them in the PAC of the TGT. Then the checked PUIDs should be copied into the auth-data of the ticket in the same order they were presented in the pre-auth. If any PUID in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST is missing from the PAC, the entire request should be rejected with Kerberos error KDC_ERR_POLICY. If the ticket issue date of the incoming TGT is before the last password reset date of any of the user/machine accounts, the entire request must be rejected with Kerberos error KDC_ERR_TGT_REVOKED (Apr SDK). When any of the following policies are violated, a ticket is issued that cannot be used to access any service, and the hr value in XKERB_PA_XBOX_SERVICE_ADDRESS is used to convey the error: If machine account is locked out (exact values in UODB TBD), request is denied. The hr value of XONLINE_E_LOGON_XBOX_ACCOUNT_BANNED is returned in the master hr of the returned pre-auth. If the title ID of the request is from a unrecognized game title ID, the hr value of XONLINE_E_INTERNAL_ERROR is returned in the master hr of the returned pre-auth When any of the following policies are violated, a ticket is issued that can be used to access the requested machine only services, and the hrUser values in XKERB_PA_XBOX_SERVICE_ADDRESS is used to convey the error for any user that has a problem. The hr value in the serviceResult array in XKERB_PA_XBOX_SERVICE_ADDRESS is filled with XONLINE_E_LOGON_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED for any service that requires users to be present: Check to make sure the game title is only requesting services that it should request. If not, XONLINE_E_INTERNAL_ERROR is returned for any service that the game title should not be requesting. If the title revision is not up to date and an update is required, then the XONLINE_E_LOGON_UPDATE_REQUIRED error is returned in the master hr (not the hrUser corresponding to any particular user). For any user that has an invalid billing status (i_acct_status_id field is greater than 0), the error code XONLINE_E_LOGON_USER_ACCOUNT_REQUIRES_MANAGEMENT is returned in hrUser for that user. For any user that has been temporarily suspended (i.e. locked out) of the service for some period of time (sd_unclock_date greater than now), the error code XONLINE_E_LOGON_USER_ACCOUNT_REQUIRES_MANAGEMENT is returned in hrUser for that user. For any user that is in the forced name change state (ti_name_change_required field is true), the error code XONLINE_E_LOGON_USER_ACCOUNT_REQUIRES_MANAGEMENT is returned in hrUser for that user. For any user that has not read the terms od service (TOS) since the last required read time (BD fields ???), the error code XONLINE_E_LOGON_USER_ACCOUNT_REQUIRES_MANAGEMENT is returned in hrUser for that user. When any of the following policies are violated, a ticket is still issued, but some of the services that are requested will be rejected. The hr value in the serviceResult array in XKERB_PA_XBOX_SERVICE_ADDRESS is used to convey why the service was not granted: If no users involved in logon, only tickets to no user required services will be granted. All other services will get XLOGON_E_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. If a requested service is not paid for by any user, a ticker to that service should be rejected with returned hr XLOGON_E_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. All other requested services should still be processed. Xbox AP request/reply Details The Xbox client uses the TKTs obtained from the Xbox KDC to construct AP-REQ and AP-REP messages that are used to perform mutual authenticate on the key exchange packets sent during setup of the IPSEC security association with Xbox security gateways. The IP address of the security gateways was obtained from the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section in the TGS reply from the Xbox KDC. The port for each service is used as the inner port sent through the IPSEC tunnel to identify the destination service. The security gateways will retrieve the auth data sealed in the TKTs and forward the auth-data to any backend service that requests it. During the key exchange packets, the controller order of the users as well as information on which user is the guest of another user is also sent from the client to the SG. The SG will use this information to reorder/update the user info in the auth data to reflect the accurate controller order and guest status, so that all backend services can know this information. Policies Enforced Make sure the TKT is valid for the site being hit. Make sure the TKT has not expired. Make sure the time stamp in the authenticator is within the time skew. Make sure the AP-request is not a replay request of a previously seen request with the exact same authenticator timestamp from the Xbox with that exact same PUID. Make sure client is only getting access to services that it was allowed in the auth-data of the TKT. Client Ticket Cache Two different ticket caches are deployed on the client, to minimize the KDC traffic, both to the AS KDC and the TGS KDC. Cache of Combined TGTs The cross realm TGT to krbtgt/xbox.com which contains (in the PAC section of the auth-data) the PUIDs of all the logon users as well as the machine PUID, is cached locally on the Xbox hard drive whenever such a ticket is successfully obtained from the AS KDC. The index key to this cache is the PUIDs of the logged on users in sorted order. Thus a cache miss would only happen when the previous ticket has expired or the set of users logging on has never been encountered before. If the set of users is the same but the controller order has changed, the cached ticket can still be used. Up to 40 such tickets can be cached, and when the cache is full, the least recently used entry in the cache is removed. Whenever, a cache hit is encountered, but the cached ticket already has more than 50% of its lifetime expired. The client continues the logon process with the cached ticket but also starts a background task to get fresh new tickets from the KDC. This is so that when the next logon with the exact same user set happens, fresh tickets with a long expiration time will be available. The session key for the cached ticket will also be stored in the cache; however, this key will be encrypted with the corresponding user keys used to obtain the TGT. This way, a cached ticket that was obtained when an MU user was present, cannot be used again after the MU has been pulled away. Cache of Service TKTs The TKTs used to access the Xbox SGs are also cached locally on the Xbox hard drive whenever such a ticket is successfully obtained from the Xbox KDC. The tickets are only cached if no services were rejected by the KDC. However, the tickets will still be cached when some of the services have S_FALSE returned (indicating that the services are on another SG). The index key to this cache is the PUIDs of the logged on users in sorted order, the title ID, and the list of requested services. Thus a cache hit would only happen when a previous request containing the exact same set of users, for the exact same title ID, and requesting the exact same set of services, stored a cached ticket that has not yet expired. If the set of users is the same but the controller order has changed, the cached ticket can still be used. Up to 40 such tickets can be cached, and when the cache is full, the least recently used entry in the cache is removed. The session key for the cached ticket will also be stored in the cache; however, this key will be encrypted with the corresponding user keys used to obtain the TGT. This way, a cached ticket that was obtained when an MU user was present, cannot be used again after the MU has been pulled away.

Executive summary Throughout the past few months we have been discussing how various keys are stored and managed by the Xbox ROM. This document attempts to summarize these discussions in order to make sure everybody is in agreement, and to make the life of the implementer easier. The ROM Boot Sequence Notations Used The following Notations will be used in the description (all keys are 16 bytes unless otherwise noted): EEPROM-KEY: A key stored in ROM used to encrypt/decrypt the EEPROM. CERT-KEY: A key stored in ROM used to morph key in XBOX_CERT header. HARD-DRIVE-KEY: A key in EEPROM used to protect the hard drive. GAME-REGION: DWORD representing game region of box. MORPHED-HD-KEY: The real key used to lock the hard drive. HDID: The hard drive serial number RAW-LAN-KEY: LAN Key stored in the XBOX_CERT header of XBE file on DVD. LAN-KEY: Final LAN Key used as pre-shared key for LAN play. RAW-SIG-KEY: Signature Key stored in XBOX_CERT header of XBE file on DVD. SIG-KEY: Final Signature Key used to sign saved games for the title. A | B: The bytes of A concatenated with the bytes of B. ENC (Key, M): M encrypted with Key using RC4Hmac, adding a 28 byte header. HMAC (Key, M): An HMAC (RFC 2104) Hash of message M using Key. ROM Image Generation There are two sensitive keys held in the ROM, the EEPROM-KEY and the CERT-KEY. Both keys should be stored in the encrypted portion of the ROM and must be kept secret. The EEPROM-KEY can be different between different versions of the ROM, but the current plan is to keep it the same until the key has been compromised. There is an issue where the default manufacturing EEPROM image needs to be changed when the EEPROM-KEY is changed. The CERT-KEY needs to be fixed forever, even if it is compromised. Both of these keys will need to be recorded and stored securely by the legal department. Whenever a new ROM image for retail units is generated the same EEPROM-KEY and CERT-KEY needs to be placed in the ROM. Devkit units do not need a EEPROM-KEY since the EEPROM in dev kits is not encrypted. The CERT-KEY should be different between devkit units and retail units. The secrecy of the devkit CERT-KEY is not critical. ROM Boot Loader The ROM boot loader decompresses the rest of the ROM and has access to the unencrypted EEPROM-KEY and CERT-KEY. The boot loader will need to place these two keys somewhere in memory for the kernel to access later. Kernel Boot Up When the kernel takes control of the machine, but before it jumps into the XBE, the kernel needs to perform a bunch of checks and operations. The next two sub-sections describe two of these operations that involve the EEPROM-KEY and the CERT-KEY. Hard Disk Locking The encrypted portion of the EEPROM contains: ENC (EEPROM-KEY, HARD-DRIVE-KEY | GAME-REGION) During boot up, the kernel will need to decrypt the encrypted portion of the EEPROM (but not on devkit units) using the EEPROM-KEY that the boot loader left behind. It then places the HARD-DRIVE-KEY and GAME-REGION somewhere in memory for future access. If the contents of the EEPROM do not decrypt correctly (RC4HMAC has a built in checksum mechanism), the boot up process fails, all keys are erased from memory and the universal error message is displayed. Proceeding after the EEPROM decrypts correctly, the Kernel will then do the following: Ask the hard drive for its HDID Compute MORPHED-HD-KEY = HMAC (HARD-DRIVE-KEY, HDID) Use MORPHED-HD-KEY as password to unlock the hard drive. If the hard drive was never locked, I am assuming that the hard drive will return an error code on the unlock operation to warn you about this fact. If the hard drive was never locked, we perform the following tests: If (Hard Drive Was Unlocked)  If (Xbox Console is not set to the Manufacturing Region) Erase all keys from memory; Display Universal Error Message; Done; // Xbox is set to the manufacturing region. If (No Image or Image not authored for Mfg Region)  Erase all keys from memory; Display Universal Error Message; Done;           // Because in some case the image to be loaded will be on the hard drive,      // the order of operations above doesn t exactly work, but it describes     // the general idea of the operation. Mount File Systems and Continue Loading;  // Check the game/manufacturing region. If ((GameRegion DWORD in XBE) AND (GameRegion DWORD in EEPROM) == 0) Erase all keys from memory; Display Wrong Game Region Error Message; Done; If all the above checks succeed, then the HARD-DRIVE-KEY is left in memory and exposed by the ROM through a private API for XTL and Online APIs to access. Whether the EEPROM-KEY is erased from memory depends on whether the  manufacturing region  bit is set in the XBE image that is about to be executed (irregardless of the whether the bit is set in the EEPROM). If it is set, then the kernel leaves the EEPROM-KEY in memory and also exposes it through a private API for the XBE code to use. This EEPROM-KEY is used by WritePerBoxData, VerifyPerBoxData and the rework recovery disk to modify data in the encrypted parts of the EEPROM.  Note that during VerifyPerBoxData we compute MORPHED-HD-KEY, lock the hard drive with the computed key (not implemented yet), and clear the manufacturing region bit in the EEPROM. During the rework recovery process, we set the manufacturing region bit in the EEPROM and unlock the hard drive. The modification of the manufacturing region bit and the locking/unlocking of the hard drive always go hand in hand together. An Xbox with an unlocked hard drive and the manufacturing region bit set should never reach a consumer. XBOX_CERT Key Morphing There are two keys stored in the XBOX_CERT header of each XBE file: the RAW-LAN-KEY and the RAW-SIG-KEY. During kernel boot up, the kernel needs to modify these two keys using the CERT-KEY. Here is how it happens: When the kernel boot up code gets to the point where it has read the XBOX_CERT header into memory, but before jumping into the XBE code, it does the following: LAN-KEY = First 16 bytes of HMAC (CERT-KEY, RAW-LAN-KEY)  SIG-KEY = First 16 bytes of HMAC (CERT-KEY, RAW-SIG-KEY) Hold LAN-KEY and SIG-KEY in memory and erases CERT-KEY from memory. The newly computed LAN-KEY and SIG-KEY will be stored back into the XBOX_CERT header where the RAW-LNA-KEY and RAW-SIG-KEY used to be stored. The LAN-KEY and SIG-KEY will need to be preserved even after a warm reboot and written back into the XBOX_CERT header for all subsequent reboots. Note that only the RAW-LAN-KEY and RAW-SIG-KEY of the first XBE file loaded after a cold reboot is used. All other RAW-KEYs in the XBOX_CERT header of subsequent warm boot XBE files are irrelevant. The game title XBE code will then be able to access LAN-KEY and SIG-KEY through the XBOX_CERT structure. The LAN-KEY is used as the pre-shared key to encrypt LAN packets. The SIG-KEY is used as the key to perform signatures on saved games etc Note that the original CERT-KEY is erased from memory irregardless of whether the executing XBE has the  manufacturing region  flag set.

This protocol will also be used when XBoxes send packets to the XBox Router and Gateway (XRG) for peer-to-peer routing to another XBox on the Internet. The protocol is general enough to encapsulate any arbitrary IP packet, regardless of the protocol or options specified on the packet.  However, the design has a special case for the common UDP packet that does not have any IP header options.  This was done to cut down on the overhead of encapsulation for the anticipated most common case. Scenarios The XTP protocol will be used to encapsulate and authenticate IP packets sent between XBoxes in two different scenarios. LAN Play In LAN play, two XBoxes are connected via an Ethernet cross-cable, or two or more XBoxes are connected via a 10Mb/sec or 100Mb/sec hub.  In this scenario the user either does not have Internet connectivity, or chooses to configure all of the XBoxes for LAN play because all of his friends that he wishes to play against are there in the same room.  This will be the highest performance, lowest latency configuration.  Communication between each of these XBoxes will be peer-to-peer and all IP packets will be encapsulated and authenticated through the use of the XTP protocol. Online Play In Online play, an XBox is connected via the Internet to an XRG server that acts as a router to connect the XBox to other online XBoxes in a peer-to-peer manner.  All IP packets transmitted between an XBox and its XRG server will be encapsulated and authenticated through the use of the XTP protocol.  All IP packets transmitted between an XRG server and another XRG server will also be encapsulated and authenticated through the use of the XTP protocol. Goals The XTP protocol has the following goals: Authentication.  The payload of an XTP packet is authenticated to prevent tampering along the way and offers replay protection.  This is important because we want to raise the security bar to a very high level for our game developers.  We want to assure them that a rogue program that is attempting to cheat, or crash the XBox, or take over the XBox by exploiting a buffer overrun has not intercepted the packets they send and receive. Simplicity.  The encapsulation of any type of IP packet is straightforward and will not noticeably impact the performance of the XBox network stack.  The goal is to make the code running on the XBox as simple as possible so that it remains small and the testing implications are minimized. Efficiency.  The packet format has been chosen to keep the overhead of encapsulation and authentication to a minimum.  It features a special encapsulation format for UDP packets that squeezes out redundant information and allows for fast encapsulation. Transparency.  We want the protocol to be transparent to firewalls and Network Address Translators (NAT) that may sit between the XBox and the Internet.  We do this by encapsulating an IP packet in the payload of a UDP packet and transmit and receive on a single well-known port, no matter which protocol or port the original IP packet specifies. Non Goals The XTP protocol has the following non-goals. Standards.  The protocol was not designed to be an Internet standard that can be used by other computers to interoperate with an XBox or an XRG server.  In fact, one of its purposes is to prevent exactly that kind of intrusion. Compatibility.  The protocol was not designed to be compatible with IPSec AH or ESP.  Though the authentication algorithms used will likely be the same, the packet format itself differs from IPSec AH and ESP. Design The design of the XTP protocol starts with an exploration of a simple IP packet encapsulation scheme in a UDP packet payload.  We then introduce the XBox Authentication Header (XAH) and describe how it differs from the IP Authentication Header (AH).  Finally we present the XTP packet format in both the general and special cases and follow each with an analysis of how much overhead the encapsulation and authentication information adds to each packet, and we compare this overhead to what would be introduced by using different standard and non-standard authentication mechanisms. IP Packet Encapsulation An IP packet has the following format.  0                   1                   2                   3     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                       Source Address                          | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Destination Address                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~                    Options                    ~    Padding    ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : IP Packet Format In order to have the best chance of having packets routed correctly through NAT devices and firewalls, the XTP protocol chooses to encapsulate an IP packet inside a UDP packet.  The outer "envelope" uses protocol UDP and Destination Port 500 (actual port TBD).  The source port is also port 500.  However, a receiver of an XTP packet should not make assumptions about the return port in the "envelope" as it may have been remapped by a NAT along the way.  The receiver is expected to reply on whatever port the "envelope" dictates. A form of encapsulation that would work is the following.  0                   1                   2                   3     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ New IP Header |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                       Source Address                          | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Destination Address                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Header |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ XAH Header ~                XAH - XTP Authentication Header                ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Orig IP Header |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                       Source Address                          | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Destination Address                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~                    Options                    ~    Padding    ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Orig Payload ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : Simple IP Encapsulation IP Authentication Header (AH) Notice that UDP encapsulation adds 28 bytes to the size of every packet, not including the XAH authentication header.

The Authentication Data field is 12 bytes long (96 bits) and contains the result of the MD5 or SHA-1 hash of the authenticated area of the packet.  The specific algorithm to use is TBD.  The Source Address is copied from the original IP header, as is the Destination Address.  The next four bytes are a union that will be described momentarily.  The final four bytes consist of a Sequence Number that is used as described in RFC 2402 (IP Authentication Header) as an anti-replay protection.  This field differs from the RFC in that it is only 31-bits long.  The final bit is a flag (the U means "UDP").  When this bit is a 1 it means that the original IP packet is a UDP protocol packet with no IP header options and that the Source Port and Destination Port fields from the original UDP packet have been copied here.  If this bit is a 0 it means that the original IP packet can be any protocol (including UDP), and that the IHL and Protocol fields from the original IP packet have been copied here.  The Reserved fields in this case must be zero. XTP Encapsulation (General Case) We can now show how any IP packet will be encapsulated.  For the general IP packet case, the packet we construct will have the following format.  0                   1                   2                   3     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ IP Header |Version|IHL (A)|Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live | Protocol (A)  |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                       Source Address (A)                      | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Destination Address (A)                    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Header |         Source Port (A)       |        Destination Port (A)   | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ XAH Header |                                                               | +                Authentication Data (96-bits)                  | |                                                               | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                       Source Address (B)                      | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Destination Address (B)                    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |Reservd|IHL (B)| Protocol (B)  |         Reserved              | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Sequence Number Field                    |0| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Orig Options ~                    Options                    ~    Padding    ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Orig Payload ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : XTP Encapsulation (General Case) In all cases, Source Address (B), Destination Address (B), IHL (B), and Protocol (B) are simply copied from the original IP packet prior to encapsulation.  Also in all cases, the IHL (A) is set to 5, the Protocol (A) is set to 17 (UDP), the Source Port (A) and Destination Port (A) are set to 500 (the well-known port of the XTP protocol).  The Version, Type of Service, Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset, and Time to Live fields are also copied from the original IP header.  The Total Length field is increased by 36 bytes (8 for the introduction of the UDP Header and 28 for the introduction of the XAH Header), and the Header Checksum field is calculated.  The Length field in the new UDP Header is set appropriately and the Checksum field is calculated. Destination Address (A) will be the same as Destination Address (B) when communicating directly with another XBox in LAN play.  When tunneling through XRG (XBox Router and Gateway), however, the Destination Address (A) will be changed to the IP Address of the XRG. Source Address (A) will be the same as Source Address (B) when communicating directly with another XBox in LAN play.  When tunneling through XRG, however, the Source Address (A) will be changed to the real IP Address of the XBox.  What does   IP Address mean?  In tunneling mode, all traffic flows to an XRG router that can hand out realm-specific IP Addresses that don t necessary correspond to the IP Address assigned to this XBox by the local NAT device, or the local ISP via DHCP or static IP Address.  The two address spaces may overlap, but there is no confusion because such a realm-specific IP Address obtained when the tunnel was created will only be used by packets which are encapsulated and sent back through the same tunnel. The Payload area of the encapsulated packet contains everything that was in the original IP packet after the IP Header.  That is, everything from offset 20 and greater.  If the original IP Header contained options, they would now be part of the Payload. Overhead Analysis For a general IP packet that consists of an IP Header (20 bytes) and N bytes of options and payload, we have the following: Format (Standard) 20 (IP) + N (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 24 (AH) + N = 44 + N AH tunneling  (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 24 (AH) + 20 (IP) + N = 64 + N ESP tunneling (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (ESP) + 20 (IP) + N + 18 (ESP) =  66 + N AH tunneling in UDP (Non Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + 24 (AH) + 20 (IP) + N = 72 + N ESP tunneling in UDP (Non Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + 8 (ESP) + 20 (IP) + N + 18 (ESP) = 74 + N XTP tunneling in UDP (Proprietary) 20 + 8 (UDP) + 28 (XAH) + N = 56 + N Therefore, in the general IP packet case, XTP adds 36 bytes to a packet to perform both encapsulation for tunneling as well as authentication.  When compared to IPSec AH, it adds 12 bytes per packet.  Notice that all the other standard and non-standard formats add more overhead than the XTP format. XTP Encapsulation (UDP Special Case) Taking into consideration that the UDP packet is the preferred packet type for gaming, we have a slight modification to the XTP encapsulation format for this case.     0                   1                   2                   3        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ IP Header    |Version|IHL (A)|Type of Service|          Total Length         |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |  Time to Live | Protocol (A)  |         Header Checksum       |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                       Source Address (A)                      |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Destination Address (A)                    |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Header    |         Source Port (A)       |        Destination Port (A)   |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |             Length            |            Checksum           |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ XAH Header    |                                                               |    +                Authentication Data (96-bits)                  |    |                                                               |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                       Source Address (B)                      |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Destination Address (B)                    |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |         Source Port (B)       |        Destination Port (B)   |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Sequence Number Field                    |1|    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Payload    ~                            Payload                            ~    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : XTP Encapsulation (UDP Special Case) Notice that the flag bit at the end of the Sequence Number Field is set to a 1 to distinguish this packet from the general case.  The setting of the various fields is the same as described in the general case above.  The major difference is that the Source Port (B) and Destination Port (B) fields of the XAH header are copied from the corresponding fields of the original UDP packet.  Notice also that there is no Protocol (B) field in this format of the packet (it overlaps with Source Port (B) and Destination Port (B)).  It is not necessary because it is known to be UDP (17) by definition.  The IHL (B) field is also missing because it is known to be 5 by definition (5 is the number of 32-bit words in an IP Header which contains no options). Finally, the Payload area of the encapsulated packet contains all the data of the original UDP packet starting after the original UDP header.  That is, everything from offset 28 and greater.  Note that this special case specifically excludes UDP packets whose IP header contains options.  For those UDP packets, general encapsulation must be used.  It is expected that UDP packets containing header options will be rarely if ever transmitted. Overhead Analysis For a UDP packet that consists of an IP Header without options (20 bytes), a UDP Header (8 bytes), and N bytes of payload, we have the following: Format (Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + N = 28 + N (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 24 (AH) + 8 (UDP) + N = 52 + N AH tunneling  (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 24 (AH) + 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + N = 72 + N ESP tunneling (IPSec Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (ESP) + 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + N + 18 (ESP) =  74 + N AH tunneling in UDP (Non Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + 24 (AH) + 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + N = 80 + N ESP tunneling in UDP (Non Standard) 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + 8 (ESP) + 20 (IP) + 8 (UDP) + N + 18 (ESP) = 82 + N XTP tunneling in UDP (Proprietary) 20 + 8 (UDP) + 28 (XAH) + N = 56 + N Therefore, in the special UDP packet case, XTP adds 36 bytes to a packet to perform both encapsulation for tunneling as well as authentication.  When compared to IPSec AH, it adds only 4 bytes per packet.  Notice that all the other standard and non-standard formats add significantly more overhead than the XTP format. Notice that for the UDP special case, the net overhead added to an IP packet for both encapsulation and authentication is 28 bytes.  In the general case (which includes TCP) it is 36 bytes.  It is possible to special case the TCP protocol as well to reduce its overhead to 32 bytes per packet, but I'm not sure its worth the trouble of adding yet another case for just four bytes. It is also possible to squeeze out the duplicate Source Address and Destination Address fields for the local LAN case (all XBox consoles directly connected on a LAN, no XRG routers).  However, if all XBox consoles really are that close together, the sending of 8 additional bytes per packet will hardly make a difference to ping times which will already be exceedingly fast.  Therefore I propose using the XTP protocol for all game traffic be it to the Internet or on local LAN. Discussion The XTP protocol works through NAT devices, as opposed to standard IPSec.  It is insensitive to transformations performed on the outer packet header.  The encapsulation format was chosen to favor the UDP packet for smallest encoding.  I believe that adding only 4 bytes more than standard IPSec is a compelling story for all we gain by it. If you look carefully at the format of the special-case UDP packet format above, you'll see that the layout starting at the XAH Header was carefully chosen.  Recall that a UDP packet whose IP header does not contain any options has the following format.    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ IP Header    |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                       Source Address                          |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Destination Address                        |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Header    |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |             Length            |            Checksum           |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Payload    ~                            Payload                            ~    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : UDP Packet Now compare this to the format of the XTP packet starting at the XAH Header.    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ XAH Header    |                                                               |    +                Authentication Data (96-bits)                  |    |                                                               |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                       Source Address (B)                      |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Destination Address (B)                    |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |         Source Port (B)       |        Destination Port (B)   |    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    |                    Sequence Number Field                    |1|    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ UDP Payload    ~                            Payload                            ~    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : XTP Packet Starting At XAH What you see is that the Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port, and Payload are all in the same place.  This allows us to perform in-place encapsulation of the UDP packet as follows.   First, allocate a standard IP Header plus UDP Header (28 bytes) from a pool.  Next, copy the first 12 bytes of the UDP packet into the new IP Header (everything but the source address and destination address).  For the LAN play case, copy those addresses as well.  For the XRG tunneling case set the destination address to the IP address of the XRG router and the source address to the real IP address of the XBox.  Set the Source Port and Destination Port in the new UDP Header to 500 / 500.  Set the Length and Checksum fields appropriately. Now back to the original UDP packet we are encapsulating.  Set the Sequence Number Field to one greater than last used.  Set the Flag field at the end of the Sequence Number Field to a '1'.  Run the MD5 or SHA-1 hash algorithm on all bytes starting at Source Address (B) to the end of the packet.  Place the 96-bit result into the Authentication Data area of the XAH Header.  Notice that all the bytes that are authenticated are contiguous.  Compare this with IPSec AH that authenticates data in various parts of the packet (though IPSec ESP authentication data is contiguous). Finally, tell the Ethernet Port to transmit a packet consisting of the 28 bytes of new IP+UDP Header followed by the all of the original UDP packet that has been zapped into the new format.  A similar trick can be played for the general case. The XRG server can turn around a packet efficiently.  Upon receipt of an encapsulated packet sent to port 500 it performs the MD5 or SHA-1 hash to verify the Authentication Data.  It uses the Source Address (B) to find the key necessary to authenticate the packet.  Once authenticated it checks the Destination Address (B) to decide where to send the packet.  The packet either needs to be forwarded to an XBox or another XRG server.  (The third place it can go is the Internet when acting as a Gateway.  That discussion is left for another document). To forward to an XBox, the Source Address (A) in the IP Header is changed to the IP Address of the XRG server, the Destination Address (A) in the IP Header is changed to the real IP Address of the XBox.  The Source Port (A) in the IP Header is set to 500 and the Destination Port (A) in the IP Header is set to the Source Port (A) that was remembered by the XRG server at the time the tunnel to the target XBox was established.  (It might not be 500 due to a NAT being in the way remapping port numbers).  Finally, the Header Checksum and UDP Checksum fields are recomputed, and the Authentication Data is recomputed using the key for the destination XBox established at the time the tunnel to the target XBox was established. To forward to another XRG server, the algorithm is similar with one slight twist.  The key used to recompute the Authentication Data is the one negotiated between the source XRG server and the destination XRG server.  (This implies that there are N^2 possible keys between the XRG routers, which should be fine since we don't anticipate the number of XRG routers to get very large.  If they do then we'll have more of a next-hop-style forwarding, but the details are not relevant now).  The Destination Address (A) in the IP Header is changed to the IP Address of the destination XRG server.  The Source Port (A) in the IP Header is set to 500 and the Destination Port (A) in the IP Header is set to 501.  Sending to a different port than the one XBox consoles send to is done on purpose.  It allows the target XRG server to know that the payload of the packet is authenticated using an XRG <-> XRG key and not an XBox <-> XRG key.  The destination XRG server knows to find the corresponding key by looking in a table indexed by the Source Address (A).  If the packet had arrived at port 500, it would appear to be a normal incoming packet from an XBox and Source Address (B) field would specify the authentication key. Unencapsulation on the XBox is also efficient and can be done in-place.  The algorithm described above which "took over" the original IP header when forming the new encapsulated packet can be run in reverse to reconstruct the original IP header for the higher layers of the TCP/IP stack.  Very little data movement will be necessary. Microsoft Confidential XBox Tunneling Protocol Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

The service uses two different types of accounts:  user accounts and machine accounts.  The machine account is used to authenticate an Xbox console to the network before any services can be accessed.  Machine account creation covers the entire process to create and secure this machine account from the time of manufacturing until user first sign-in.  This document describes the entire machine account creation and provisioning process. The key point to understand in Xbox machine account creation is that we leverage manufacturing to generate a unique  secret  that is shared by each individual Xbox and the service.  This secret is used to bootstrap secure communication and the process of authenticating an Xbox.  The threat of compromising our machine account creation process is that computers can masquerade as Xbox machines. This document covers the machine account creation process that begins with the generation of keys at manufacturing and continues through to the completion by accepting the machine long-term key for the Passport machine account.  The Design Section will describe the protocols used to securely communicate information to our service; the manufacturing genealogy database and the User and Offerings Database; the Xbox Key Distribution Center (XKDC) and the threat model of a compromise or attack on our machine account creation process. The Xbox Network Security specification (  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Security"  http://sts/xbox_online/Security ) describes the network security protocols that an Xbox uses after the initial machine account creation.

This strong password is used to authenticate the Xbox upon future connections to our service. This section describes the design of: the Online Key generated during manufacturing and how it is used to establish trust; the database schema that contains the machine credentials; the network protocols used to authenticate Xbox consoles for the purpose of providing secure online services for the Xbox; Passport machine account creation; and the Machine Account Creation server.  Manufacturing Processes and Keys Before the service can create an Xbox Machine Account, it must have some way to trust that the entity on the other end is really an Xbox and not a PC (or some other easily programmable computing device) masquerading as an Xbox.  If a PC were able to masquerade as an Xbox and create an Xbox Machine Account, then the PC can continue to create user accounts and participate in Xbox online subscription services.  Participation in the service includes creating users, downloading content and playing games.  To solve the problem of PC s masquerading as Xbox consoles, we leverage the manufacturing process to create a secret that both sides can share for each Xbox produced.  Spoofing and masquerading attempts are thwarted by creating a random Online Key during manufacturing that is only known to both the Xbox and online service. Each production line has a system integration test computer that runs thorough diagnostic information on each Xbox before it is sent to the more general system level test.  The system integration test computer also generates unique, machine-specific data and several random keys.  These keys are used to protect various different parts of the Xbox gaming system to insure that malicious users cannot subvert their Xbox consoles. This section describes the Online key, what needs to be recorded and how some of the recorded data gets secured during transit.   The system test computer sends the machine-specific data to the Xbox and records relevant information into a   HYPERLINK  \l "_Manufacturing_Genealogy_Database"  manufacturing genealogy database Online Key The system integration test computer generates a random, machine-specific Online Key that will be used as a shared secret between the Xbox and online service. The Online Key is 16 bytes long. The system integration test computer sends machine-specific data to test software running on the Xbox that writes the data to the EEPROM.  The system integration test computer also encrypts the Online Key and writes the machine-specific data to the manufacturing genealogy database.  Periodically, the manufacturing transfers the information to the genealogy database that we access. The Machine Account Creation KDC will extract the Online Key (and machine-specific serial number) from the Genealogy database to authenticate that this is an Xbox during machine account creation. The system integration test computer encrypts the Online Key before it is recorded into the manufacturing genealogy database because unlike the hard drive key and the recovery key, the Online Key is much more sensitive and needs to be strongly protected from being compromised. The reason the Online Key is sensitive is because a malicious user can use the machine credentials and Online Key to create an Xbox Machine Account on their PC.  The hard drive key and recovery key are only useful to a particular Xbox and do not have to be protected in our manufacturing process as strongly. We will encrypt each online key with a public key at the factory before we store the data into the manufacturing genealogy database. The Xbox online team possesses the corresponding private key and it is held within (nCipher brand) secure hardware devices.  These nCipher devices decrypt the Online Key during online account provisioning.  Only the Xbox online team will be able to decrypt the Online Keys.  The Online key is only briefly exposed in memory during creation at the factory and in memory upon a Machine Account Creation request.   The Xbox online team uses 1024 bit RSA public key encryption to protect these online keys.  The encrypted Online Key will be 128 bytes.  As an added precaution against compromise of the private key, we want to be able to change the public/private key pair used to encrypt the Online Key.  The system integration test computer will also send a  Key Version  field to the manufacturing genealogy database. Key Version  field is currently  If the private key is compromised, the online team will generate a new public/private key pair and increment the  Key Version  field.  Since the current Online Keys in Genealogy database were encrypted with the old private key, they must be decrypted and then re-encrypted with the new public key.  This process is documented more thoroughly in the section   HYPERLINK  \l "_Compromise_of_the"  Compromise of the Online Key Management System .  We will only build the tools to switch the key version, if/when our current key is stolen.   Manufacturing Genealogy Database The Manufacturing Genealogy Database is maintained by the hardware operations (HOPS) team and contains information required for manufacturing.  It is periodically sent to the Xbox online data center and the Xbox online team pulls out a few required fields for the online machine account creation process.  Here are the fields (and their lengths) that are recorded into the genealogy database during manufacturing and are needed by the Xbox online team: Length Description SerialNum Unique primary key.  12 digit serial. No dashes. MaterialNum Microsoft Part number. (SKU) OnlineKeyVer Version of encryption (only meaningful to us) OnlineKey 128 byte PK.  Base64 encoded to 172 bytes Manufacturing Genealogy Database Contact: Arch Holder  HYPERLINK  \l "_Manufacturing_and_Hardware"  HOPS team  will have to provide this information for each added or modified genealogy database record. And this for each deleted genealogy database record:   SerialNum Genealogy records should be deleted when we destroy an Xbox. Machine Account Authentication and Sign-Up Process Once the machine credentials (including the Online Key) have been moved into the Genealogy database, the process to authenticate and create an Xbox machine account (also called  Sign-up ) can take place.  The process and protocols described here follow the chronological steps required for machine account creation. Any malformed packets or non-compliance to the protocol may mean the attempted spoofing by a PC and may result in us dropping packets at the router to avoid DoS attacks, or the blocking of the machine account by setting the  BlockedDate  value in the UODB to the current date.  The account may be unblocked after investigation.  In the beginning, the process for investigation of security violations will be on a case-by-case basis by the product team.  Future processes may be created and documented once patterns emerge.  (See the security section for more details.) DNS Resolution to the Machine Account Creation KDC Upon initial online sign-up, the Xbox will use an asynchronous resolution method to resolve the address to the Machine Account Creation KDC (XMACs), the Passport KDC and the Xbox KDC (XKDC): xmacs.xbox.com passport.xbox.com xkdc.xbox.com will be hard-coded in the XTL code that the title links with. Initial Kerberos AS Request Once the domain name to XMACs is resolved, the Xbox initiates the authentication process through the Kerberos protocol [RFC 1510].  The shared Online Key that was generated during manufacturing is only used in this process to establish trust between the entities.  The Xbox starts the Kerberos AS request cycle to XMACs.  First the Xbox sends a Kerberos AS request (KRB_AS_REQ) to XMACs.  The principal is the Xbox serial number that was generated at manufacturing and stored on EEPROM.  The realm is  xmacs.xbox.com The preauthorization field contains the PA_ENC_TIME (encoded time) encrypted with the shared Online Key.  If the time is out of tolerance (or not set), a standard Kerberos exchange happens to set the offset to the clock. Genealogy Database Lookup XMACs must first validate the received packet is in the right format and that the keyed hash of the serial number is valid.  XMACs will lookup the following fields in the Genealogy database through a special extension to the KDC that allows  stand-alone  authentication: SerialNum MaterialNum OnlineKey OnlineKeyVer The Online Key is encrypted by the public key at manufacturing and base64 encoded so XMACs must base64 decode, then decrypt the Online Key using an nCipher box that will be installed on XMACs.  If the information is formatted correctly but the decryption fails, XMACs will alert the data center when   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  receiving invalid packets .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The  BlockedDate  field for this serial number should not be set as this might be a random set of information generated by an attacker. If the record does not exist, the data center will be alerted that   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  invalid credentials are being sent .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The alert will be sent using the general alerting, monitoring and logging mechanism put in place by the Ops team. MaterialNum  represents whether an Xbox is a Developer Xbox, Debug Kit, Retail Xbox, Beta Xbox or other.  If the  MaterialNum  designates the Xbox attempting to create a machine account is not a Retail or Beta Xbox, no reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated. XMACs MEM Lookup To prevent a possible DDoS replay attack of credentials the XMAC server will cache the serial number and number of account creation or account reset attempts of requesting machines.  If a given machine (serial number) has made more than 20 requests within a minute, XMACs will log a special event for Ops and start throwing away requests from the particular client for the following hour.  After an hour, the machine may again, attempt to create or reset its machine account. User and Offerings Database Lookup The following figure shows the logic flow for the XMACs.  The first check is whether the SerialNum is found in the Genealogy DB.  If the serial number is valid (contained in the Genealogy DB), XMACs will query the following fields through a SQL command to the separate server containing the UODB: SerialNum BlockedDate The next check is whether the SerialNum is found in the UODB.  If the SerialNum is not in the UODB, the machine account has not been created and therefore XMACs will create the machine account and return it to the Xbox. If the record is in the UODB, XMACs checks whether the requesting Xbox has been blocked.  If the BlockedDate field in the UODB is non-null, the data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.    EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   If the BlockedDate field is null, the machine account has already been created but the Xbox needs XMACs to resend the credentials.  XMACs will reset the machine account password and send the credentials to the Xbox. Passport Machine Account Creation After XMACs verifies the information passed in the preauthorization field of the Kerberos AS request sent from the Xbox, XMACs will create a machine account on the Passport KDC using Delegated Administrator (DA) functions provided by the Passport team.   Passport uses email addresses as the account name so a special machine account name is created for each Xbox. nnnnnnnnnnnn.xmacs@xbox.com Where nnnnnnnnnnnn is the unique 12-digit Xbox serial number. The long-term password for the machine account is never seen (or entered) by users and will be randomly generated to guarantee a strong password that is not susceptible to dictionary attacks. A random 128-bit string is used as the long-term Passport machine account password. Since all Xbox machine accounts are Passport accounts each will have a unique 64-bit Passport ID (PUID) associated with it.  The PUID is returned by Passport for each new account created.  We cache the PUID and serial number on the Xbox upon sign-in. Upon failure, XMACs will return an error code to the Xbox and alert our data center that   HYPERLINK  \l "_Passport_Machine_Account"  Passport cannot create a machine account User and Offerings Database Update Before returning the newly created or updated Passport machine account to the Xbox, the UODB needs to be updated with the recently created or updated Passport machine account.  If it is a new account, we will set all the fields in the UODB.  If it is a reset account, we will update the resetdate. If Passport has an error such that the PUID returned does not match the recorded PUID for this Serial number in the UODB, then we will replace the PUID and log a bug. XMACs Reply Once the Passport account is created successfully, XMACs sends back a Kerberos AS reply. The Xbox first validates that the reply is properly formatted and encrypted with the proper Online Key.  If these checks fail then the Xbox gives the  Online service is busy.  Try again later  message. The Xbox does not use the TGT in the Kerberos AS reply but stores the Passport machine account PUID, name, realm and machine account key contained in the encrypted pre-auth of the response onto the hard drive and it will be used subsequently as the machine credentials sent to authenticate to the Passport KDC.   The Passport machine account long-term password is stored on the Xbox hard drive so that is can be persisted over shutdowns and reboots.  Since it is considered harder to figure out the hard drive key of an Xbox than it is to crack open its hard drive and read the contents, we will encrypt all passwords and keys we store on the hard drive with the hard drive key.  This makes the difficulty level of obtaining information from an Xbox that you have physical access to about the same as figuring out the hard drive key of the Xbox. The Xbox will store machine keys and user keys in the configuration sector of the hard drive, because the configuration sector will survive a hard drive reformat and recovery. This makes Xbox accounts persist over most hard drive recoveries. Sign-In At this point, the Passport machine account has been created and the credentials have been stored on the hard drive.  Subsequent sign-in attempts go directly to the Passport KDC to get an Combined Ticket to the XKDC and are covered under the network security specification.  If this attempt to sign-in is not following the previous process of creating a machine account and the Xbox has no cached Combined Ticket, the Xbox will first use an asynchronous resolution method to resolve the address to the Passport KDC and the Xbox KDC: passport.xbox.com xkdc.xbox.com will be hard-coded in the XTL code that the title links with.  The asynchronous model is described in   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/API Spec - Online Work Pump.doc"  http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/API Spec - Online Work Pump.doc If the Xbox has a cached Combined Ticket, it will immediately make a   HYPERLINK  \l "_Kerberos_TGS_Request_to XKDC"  Kerberos TGS Request to the XKDC Kerberos AS Request to Passport KDC with Machine Credentials To access the Xbox Key Distribution Center (XKDC), the Xbox must have a Combined Ticket (CT) from the Passport service.  In order to get a CT the Xbox must first have a machine Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and a user TGT for each user, from Passport.  In the case where the Xbox has just created a machine account and no users are present the Xbox makes one Kerberos AS request for a TGT in the realm of Passport.  Both of these tickets are cached for 1 week on the Xbox.  Once they have expired, the Xbox can get a new ticket. Kerberos TGS Request to Passport KDC for Combined Ticket using TGS-combined The Xbox then makes a Kerberos AS Request to the Passport KDC sending the TGT it just received from Passport KDC.  Passport KDC will return a Combined Ticket for the XKDC. Kerberos TGS Request to XKDC Once the Xbox has received the Combined Ticket, it can connect to the Xbox KDC to retrieve a Service Ticket (ST) to the User Account Provisioning server.  (The Service ticket is cached for 1 day on the Xbox) The protocol is covered in the Xbox Network Security specification (  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Specs"   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Security/"  http://sts/xbox_online/Security/ User and Offerings Database Lookup Before the XKDC returns a Service Ticket to the requesting Xbox, the XKDC queries the UODB to see if the  BlockedDate  field for the requesting Xbox is set.  If the Xbox is blocked, the connection will be dropped and no reply will be sent.  The XKDC also queries for the  ResetDate  field in the UODB for the requesting Xbox.  If the Combined Ticket was issued before the  ResetDate  of the requesting Xbox, the XKDC will deny the Xbox an ST. Xbox Security Gateway ST returned in Kerberos AS Reply Once the XKDC has verified that it should grant a Service Ticket to the requesting Xbox, it returns a Service Ticket for the Security Gateway. IPsec Tunnel established with Security Gateway The connection to the User Account Provisioning (UAP) service must be highly secure because user accounts are created and their long-term passwords are received.  The Xbox presents the ST to the Security Gateway and establishes a Triple-DES secure connection using IPSec.  The protocol is covered in the Xbox Network Security specification (  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Security/"  http://sts/xbox_online/Security/ User Account Provisioning At this point the Xbox is connected to the User Account Provisioning server and user account creation can take place.  This process is covered in the   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online"  User Account Provisioning spec Failure Scenarios Lost Packets / interrupted procedures There are a number of points in the process where we could have interruptions, lost packets, power outages, etc.  This section outlines the back up plans in case of failure. Client side failure DNS Look up If this fails 3 times, we will give up and report a networking failure.  The user will then have to make sure they have the network set up appropriately. No response / malformed response from XMACs If this happens multiple times, the user will be told to  try again later. Xbox connection breaks during Machine account creation When the connection comes back up, the user should just plug the box in and try again.  The server will reset the password and send the new machine account credentials down to the Xbox. Server side failure This is covered in the operations portion of the spec. For most failures the user will be told to try again later and we will log the appropriate errors on our servers for the operations team.  When the user tries again, if the account is not yet created, the second try will be the same as the first.  If the account is already partially created, than we will do the following actions: The passport account already exists but is not in the UODB:  In this case, we will reset the password on the passport account, store the new credentials in the UODB, and then send them down to the Xbox. The account is already in the UODB:  We will reset the password on the passport account, update the resetdate in the UODB and send the new credentials down to the Xbox. Database failure Passport or the UODB can go down.  In this case, we would like to keep as much of the service as possible up and running.  We will not be able to sign new users on during either of these scenarios.  However, we do have plans to allow existing machine accounts to continue to sign on when our services go down. Passport Is Down If passport goes down and the user needs a new ticket from the passport KDC (because the old one expired), then they will be locked out of our service.  To avoid this problem, we will renew the tickets for the machine accounts and user accounts when the tickets are only   of the way to their expiration date.  Generally, these tickets expire in 1 week.  This means, that a user who logs in every day would have their ticket updated every 3.5 days.  Thus, the user could continue to use our service for 3.5 days after the passport KDC goes down.  This plan will not help infrequent users.  Thus, we will need an error message such as E_COME_BACK_LATER when the service goes down. UODB Is Down But We Want Machines/Users to Logon Anyway The behavior in this scenario is pending a decision by Mike Lucero, Kelly, Boyd, Todd, and Cameron Details about the final result will be in the User Account spec because it deals mainly with user account authentication and authorization rather then machine account creation. Encryption Scheme used in Kerberos We use  RC4-HMAC  encryption in the Kerberos request and reply.  All encrypted data is prefixed with a 16 byte checksum and an 8 byte confounder.  The encryption process generates random bytes for the confounder then combines the confounder with the raw data and computes a keyed HMAC checksum.  The checksum is then used to compute a new key.  The new key is used to encrypt the confounder and the raw data.  The decryption process first computes the decryption key based on the checksum and then decrypts the confounder and the raw data.  Then it performs the same computation to derive the checksum and verifies that the checksum matches. Since the real key that is used during encryption and decryption is only 16 bytes long (the size of the MD5 hash output) we use 16 byte keys for all of our encryption.  Using larger size keys will not increase our cipher strength and will only increase our headaches during export approval. User and Offerings Database The User and Offerings Database (UODB) contains these fields for each Machine Account entry in the machine account table: Length Description SerialNum Unique primary key.  12-digit serial.  No dashes. BlockedDate Machine account sign-in has been blocked MachinePUID Passport machine account PUID ResetDate Date of last password reset BlockedDate  and  ResetDate  are null upon row creation. Machine Account Creation KDC The Machine Account Creation KDC (XMACs) is the first Xbox server that an Xbox will talk to.  XMACs runs a special  Stand-Alone  version of the Microsoft KDC that does not rely upon Active Directory to authenticate requests coming in from clients.   Kerberos The communication protocol with XMACs will be Kerberos on UDP port 88. Authentication Plug In We are building our service as a plug-in DLL to the stand-alone KDC from the NT team.  Our authentication plug-in passes information (such as the passport machine account) in the pre-auth of the standard Kerberos responses. nCipher Devices There will be an nCipher device installed in each XMACs.  The nCipher device decrypts the Online Key that is stored in the User and Offerings Database (UODB).  XMACs should issue an alert if the   HYPERLINK  \l "_nCypher_device_not"  nCipher device is not responding .  Nicky Pike owns a spec for the nCipher Devices. Clock Synchronization Skew XMACs and Xbox client-side code will enforce time checks for the initial Kerberos AS cycle to create a machine account.  The Xbox sends the local time and zone to the KDC.  If the time is off by more than 5 minutes, the KDC returns the server time.  The Xbox adjusts and sends the new request.   If the user has not set their time zone in the dash, the default one (GMT) will be sent. Testing scenarios Our Machine account creation mechanism for Dev kits is different from the retail kits.  Dev kits do not have unique serial numbers, so the normal procedure would issue all dev kits the same machine account.  To avoid this problem, they will all send up a special serial number of 999999999999, and a special fixed online key.  Then, the XMACs server will execute special code to issue them unique accounts. The development code executes the following process to create a machine account:  (Changes from retail code are underlined) Send up SN of 99999999999 and online key of of EH{PASSWORD}time Genealogy database receives special pair and accepts it.  (Only in test server   not on production server) XMACs checks to see if SN 999999999999 is in the UODB.   SN 999999999999 is never in the UODB, so the UODB returns no. XMACs calls passport to create a new machine account.  However, it does not create a machine account for 999999999999.  Instead, it makes up a special 12 digit name for this account. Passport creates an account for G{GUID} and returns it to XMACs. XMACs records this account in the UODB, but for a serial number, it uses a special sentinel value such as 888888888888.  This value guarantees that dev kits will never find their account in the UODB (step 4), so every time a dev kit tries to create an account it will make a brand new machine account. XMACs sends the account down to the DVT.  (G{GUID} and password) The code attempts to mimic the retail version as much as possible.  However, because XMACs creates a special new account for each dev kit, a development kit will never execute the code which resets the machine account password.  When a development kit goes to get a machine account, it will get a new one every time.  When a retail kit attempts to recover a machine account, it will receive the same one with a new password. For more details on testing the XMACs server, see the XMACs Server Test Plan. Security This section covers potential security issues and how these will be addressed.  Xbox uses an augmented threat model that we call K-STRIDE which is based on the STRIDE put together by the Secure Windows Initiative team.  The STRIDE model has been augmented with several network-specific topics that I wanted to discuss separately from the general STRIDE groupings.  For more information on security, see the SWI team web site at   HYPERLINK "http://swiweb"  http://swiweb This section discusses the known vulnerabilities of the Xbox Machine Account Creation process, server and protocol. For each vulnerability we know about, we describe the importance of the vulnerability, the possible known attacks that could be deployed, and if the vulnerability could be caused by a title, we discuss what certification requirements we should have on all released titles to make sure that the vulnerability is minimized. Key Management and Exchange The only thing worse than cryptographically weak keys is exchanging strong keys with an adversary.  The secure management and exchange of keys is a fundamental requirement.  Online Key The system integration test computer generates a unique, machine-specific Online Key that will be used as a shared secret between the Xbox and online service.   Importance The compromise of the Online Key would let a hacker create a valid Xbox machine account on their PC. Attack During manufacturing, the system integration test computer creates, encrypts and stores the Online Key into the manufacturing genealogy database.  The Machine Account Creation KDC will extract the encrypted Online Key and decrypt it using a secure nCipher hardware device.  The Online Key is only held temporarily in memory and is never sent or persisted in the clear. Compromise of the Online Key Management System We have a plan for dealing with a compromise of the online key management system.  However, we will not build any of the code to handle this case until if/when we actually have a compromise.  The current estimate is that it will take us about two weeks to completely transfer over to a new key. In case of: A compromise of the private key used to encrypt the Online Key; The disappearance of an operator smart card used to start an nCipher device; The disappearance of an administrator smart card used to initialize nCipher devices, create operator and administrator smart cards; or The disappearance of an nCipher device  These steps must be considered: Machine Account Creation Servers and Databases taken offline The valid and invalid machine ID ranges must be determined A new nCipher device must be procured and initialized to match the scalability requirements (with a minimum of 2 active devices online in case of failover) with 2 more backups owned by dev and test, respectively A new security world must be set up for the nCipher devices 6 administrator smart cards must be created; At least 2 administrator smart cards must be used to do any operation 4 Operator cards must be created A new public/private key pair must be generated The new public key is sent to manufacturing and used for encryption of the manufacturing "Online Key" All current Online Keys in the UODB need to be decrypted and re-encrypted with the new public key.  The  Key Version  field needs to be updated. All genealogy database updated with the old version of the public key must be decrypted and re-encrypted with the new public key before insertion into the UODB.  The  Key Version  field needs to be updated. 2 operator smart cards are sent to operations 1 operator smart card is put into the Redmond ITG secure operations center 1 operator smart card is put into the Dublin secure operations center 4 administrator smart cards are put into the Redmond ITG secure operations center 2 administrator smart cards are put into the Dublin secure operations center All currently encrypted keys decrypted with the old private key and re-encrypted with the new public key The Online Key Version field in the UODB is updated with the new version Machine Account Creation Servers and Databases reinstated Spoofing Identity Machine account creation attempted without valid credentials The connection will be dropped on the server without sending any information back to the Xbox.  Valid users will timeout and be directed to our call center by the Xbox.  The timeout is determined by development based on standard network protocol durations and retries.  An alert will be signaled:   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  Alert: Machine account creation attempted without valid Online Key The credentials passed to create a machine account were not valid.  This has these possible causes in order of likelihood: A hacker has attempted to spoof information. The valid machine information created at a refurbishing facility has not been populated into our Genealogy database. The valid machine information created at the factory has not been populated into our Genealogy database. An invalid Xbox has been created by a compromise of the manufacturing security. PC Spoofing Attempt A hacker is attempting to send bogus credentials to either gain authentication or to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Denial_of_Service_from Account Crea"  deny service to the Machine Account Creation Servers  by taking up resources to validate the bogus credentials.  This is similar to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted "  replaying credentials from a valid Xbox Valid machine information created by a refurbishment center but not entered into our database A valid, but refurbished Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate credentials created by the refurbishment center has broken down and must be investigated.  The user s box will have to be shipped back to the repair center. Valid machine information created by the factory but not entered into our database A valid Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate credentials created by the factory has broken down and must be investigated. The user s box will have to be shipped back to the repair center. Invalid Xbox Manufacturing security of the Xbox creation process has broken down and the rogue Xbox is attempting to create a machine account.  This should be a very rare scenario.  In this case, the box will have to be shipped back to the repair center.  If the user is a deliberate hacker, they will probably not send the box to our repair center. PC Masquerading as an Xbox If a hacker compromises an Xbox serial number and Online Key pair and the Xbox has not signed up for the service, then they can write a program that would follow our machine account creation protocol and get the Passport machine account long-term password.   If this PC ever varies from our standard protocol, we will detect this difference and take action to block the machine account.  The blocking will be done initially on a case by case basis by the product team.  This will make this attack very difficult. Tampering with Data Tampering with data involves the malicious modification of system or user data with or without detection. An unauthorized change made to stored or in-transit information, the formatting of a hard disk, the introduction by a malicious intruder of an undetectable network packet in a communication, and an undetectable change made to a sensitive file are all examples of tampering threats. Tampering with the Machine Account Creation protocols The information in the Kerberos AS cycle is protected by the  Online Key .  Tampering with the encrypted data will be rejected and the data center alerted. Tampering with the Hard Drive This requires access to the hard drive key and the threat model is discussed elsewhere. Repudiability  Repudiability threats are associated with users malicious or otherwise who can deny performing an action without administrators having any way to prove otherwise. An example of a repudiability threat is a user performing an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace such operations. Blocking of a valid account There are situations where a valid account may blocked due to suspicious activity.  An eavesdropper might record the machine account creation protocol and replay it at a later time and block that machine account.  This threat will have to be weighed against the more common scenario of a hacker watching their own Xbox traffic and trying to write a PC program to spoof the system. If the user complains about the block, it can be escalated to the product team for further review.  We will unblock accounts on a case by case basis if we feel there was a valid explanation for the behavior. Information Disclosure Information disclosure threats involve the compromising of private or business-critical information through the exposure of that information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user's ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to and an intruder's ability to read data in transit between two computers are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that in this case the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to appear as a legitimate user. Discovering machine credentials in the Xbox Kerberos AS request The Xbox sends the serial number and machine credentials encrypted with the  Online Key  in the Kerberos AS request.  Access to this information involves breaking the  Online Key .  There is a confounder in the payload so a test against known information in the cipher text is more difficult.   Denial of Service (DoS) Denial of service (DoS) threats when carried out deny service to valid users for example, by making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable or by forcing a reboot or restart of the user's machine. You must protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability. Other types of DoS threats, however, are very hard to protect against; at a minimum, you should identify and rationalize such threats. Denial of Service to the Machine Account Creation KDC XMACs must be able to withstand DoS attacks by sending bogus credentials and replaying valid credentials.  It must determine both of these scenarios as quickly as possible and not lock resources that are used for valid credentials.   The quick validity check should be a stateless procedure that can be preformed by the server by checking the keyed hash of the serial number.  After a validity check of the serial number, a SQL query is performed and cached so that subsequent messages with that serial will not cause another SQL query. If invalid credentials were sent, then the alert   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _1"  invalid credentials are being sent  should be triggered. All detected attacks should free all resources and should not return anything back to the Xbox. We will also detect these attacks by counting the number of requests we get from any given Xbox in a minute.  If this is higher than a certain threshold level, then we will ignore all packets from that box for the next hour.  This should not affect valid users, and if a valid user does have a problem, they can try again in an hour. Denial of Service to the XKDC We will handle DoS attacks to the XKDC very similarly to attacks on XMACs. Denial of Service to the Passport KDC Passport will handle this. Elevation of Privilege Issue: to be examined Compromised Passport KDC A malicious user hacking into the Passport Key Distribution Center and retrieving keys from the Passport database. Importance Needless to say, this would be very serious if it should happen. All of our online authentication security relies on the secrecy of these shared keys. And if the keys are compromised, then most of the vulnerabilities discussed in this section will also be exposed. Attack This is a well known problem with lots of possible attacks and lots of ways to prevent such attacks. We should always keep in mind that a compromised KDC renders everything else we do to ensure online security, completely useless, and because of this we need to do everything in our power to secure our KDC from attacks. The Passport team is well aware of these issues and will put lots of infrastructure in place to guarantee the security of the KDC. Compromised XMACs A malicious user hacking into our XMACs and retrieving keys from our database. Importance While this vulnerability is serious, it is not as serious as the Passport KDC being compromised. The malicious user with these compromised keys can crack open all the tickets for all the services and be able to access the session keys within the tickets. In reality though, since most malicious users do not have access to the Internet backbone, they will only be able to do this for tickets sent to their own Xbox. With this session key, they will be able to morph, inject, and drop packets send to and from the Xbox, which will give them some game cheating capabilities. Attack This is a well known problem with lots of possible attacks and lots of ways to prevent such attacks.  All keys retrieved from our UODB without going through our code on the KDC will be useless as all keys are stored in an encrypted form using public/private keys and nCipher devices.  The encryption will be performed by the system integration test computer during manufacturing.  The decryption requires access to our nCipher device. Cracking an Xbox/User Key over the Network A malicious network user figuring out somebody else s Xbox/User key, without physical access to the Xbox. Importance Most of the security of our authentication protocol relies on the strong Xbox/User key not being known by a malicious user. If a malicious user was able to obtain an Xbox/User key of another Xbox or user, he would be able to impersonate that Xbox/User and purchase online items that would get billed to that Xbox/User. This section only discusses the vulnerability of a malicious network user obtaining the Xbox/User key. The vulnerability of an Xbox owner (or anybody with physical access to the Xbox) figuring out his/her own Xbox/User key (which is easier) is discussed in another section. Attack The Xbox/User key is 128 bits of random data generated by XMACs. It is always encrypted with the hard drive key before being stored on the hard drive of the Xbox and is never sent over the wire in the clear.  We believe this key is secure from a malicious user on the network that does not have physical access to the Xbox. A brute force attack would be out of the question due to the key size.   Attack The PC now has the credentials of a (possibly) paying customer.  These credentials can be replicated across the network and possible PC spoofing attempts will succeed. Cracking the Hard Drive Key A malicious user figuring out the hard drive key of an Xbox that he/she has physical access to. Importance The hard drive key is used to lock the hard drive from usage on a PC. It is also used to encrypt any keys we store on the hard drive. If it is compromised, the malicious user could unlock the hard drive and retrieve and decrypt information like the Xbox key and user keys from the hard drive. Attack The hard drive key is stored on the EEPROM in encrypted form. I am omitting details here to avoid unnecessary info from being leaked out. Most readers of this document do not need to be concerned about the details here, but just need to know that we recognize the risk and have plans in place to secure this key from the owner of the Xbox as much as we can. Authentication Replay Attacks A malicious user could reuse packets sent over the wire to achieve malicious goals. Importance Tickets to the various online services are sent over the wire and a malicious user who sniffs the packets can reuse the tickets to gain services that would otherwise be denied or to replay the packets to deny service to authentication. Attack Most of the attacks in this area have already been thought through when Kerberos was designed. We are relying on the security of the Kerberos protocol to prevent against such attacks.  In addition, we keep a count of how many account creation attempts have been done and block the account after a certain number. Hijacking Xbox Online Service A malicious user hijacking the DNS name resolution of  passport.com  and  xbox.com  and directing all online traffic to his own special Xbox online service. Importance A malicious user that can hijack the DNS resolution of  passport.com  and  xbox.com  for a region of Xbox users could provide an alternate Xbox online service, and deprive Microsoft of the revenue stream. Attack The attacker cannot easily fool an Xbox to create an online account at his site since mutual authentication will be performed by using the Online Key during the Xbox Machine Account Creation step.  The generation and storage of the Online Key is discussed at length throughout this document.  The Xbox will not respond if an improperly formed packet comes back from the rogue  XMACs Blanking out the Online Key or Passport Machine Account Long-Term Password Arbitrary code executing on the Xbox could write either the Online Key and/or Passport machine account long-term password (and checksums) that would be known to a malicious online service provider. While this Xbox will not be able to create a machine account nor authenticate with Xbox online services, it could connect to another service.  Then the impersonating online server could provide services to these Xbox s from the impersonating servers.  This kind of a scenario could play out in a college dorm where one user legally downloads a lot of expensive content and sets up his own server to provide the content to anybody else in the dorm that allows him to crack open his Xbox and modify the key.  This requires a full scale attack on Xbox keys and each user to actively subvert their Xbox.  This type of attack could also be much more easily carried out by somebody that has stolen the genealogy database and has the nCipher device or private key. Stealing the Xbox Genealogy Database At manufacturing time we record information about every Xbox created into a genealogy database.  The database contains the matching serial number, hard drive key and Online Key for each Xbox. The Online Key will be encrypted with a public key at manufacturing time which deprecates the threat of the genealogy database being stolen without additional information.  The hacker would also need an nCipher device and operator smart card or the private key stored inside the nCipher device.  None of these are easy to accomplish. The hard drive key is still in the database in unencrypted form and thus we still need to keep the database as controlled as possible to prevent people from actively subverting their Xbox. Importance A malicious user that has access to this information can obtain the hard drive of his own Xbox and thus the Passport machine- and user-account long-term passwords.  This allows the user to perform everything associated with  PC emulating an Xbox  and  PC Spoofing as an Xbox However, the malicious user can only do these bad things on their existing Xbox account.  In any case the user still cannot impersonate another Xbox or user that he does not have physical access to. Attack The most obvious attack is to compromise any location that has this database. This database is located at all the manufacturing and refurbishment sites. These sites will most likely have less stringent security measurements and will have lower paid workers that are willing to steal the information for a price, or that are unaware of the importance of this information and more likely to perform actions that compromise the information. This information also makes some kind of journey from the manufacturing facility to the various refurbishment sites.  This exchange must be made very secure also. Operations Events This section details all events that may be written to any of the OS event logs   primarily but not constrained to the System, Application, and Security logs. Events must be written at any point where a response is necessary from an resource external to the component.  Events are the triggers for actions   corrective or preventative, machine or human.  If an event does not directly trigger an action, consideration should be given as to whether there is a better way to provide the information. Events should contain enough information to be reasonably intuitive.  Events that do not utilize the description field are not intuitive. Event List: Event ID Source Description Action 50600 Information Xmacs MAC service has started 50601 Error Xmacs MAC Service has stopped Page on call Ops 50602 Information Xmacs Passport connection established None  50603 Error Xmacs Passport connection has failed Verify Passport is connected/functioning.

Check logs for possible DoS attack. Start Debug logging MAC Service has started:  The server has been rebooted and this is let OPS know the service has started up correctly.   Mac Service has stopped: Passport connection Established:  Server has been rebooted and connection to the Passport has succeeded. Passport Connection failed:  Server has been rebooted and the connection to Passport could not be established. Connection to Geneology DB established:  Server has been rebooted and connection to the Geneology has succeeded.   Connection to Geneology DB has Failed:  Server has been rebooted and the connection to Passport could not be established or the connection has failed through the heartbeat API. Connection to Xmac UADB Front door established:  The server has been rebooted and the connection to the UADB front door for Xmacs has succeeded Connection to Xmac UADB Front Door has failed:  Server has been rebooted and connection to UADB Front door could not be established or heartbeat API has reported that connection was unsuccessful Packet/Encryption Failure:  Map server has received packets that are not in the right format or the keyed hash of the Xbox serial number is not correct.  This may be caused by several issues.  One is that a malicious users is attempting to spoof an Xbox and does not have the correct online encryption key.  The connection should be dropped and all relative information logged.  The other cause would be that encryption is not working correctly due to nCipher malfunction, in which we would need to check the nCipher device for proper functionality. Ncipher not responsive:  The Ncipher device has failed and is no longer functioning properly MAC service failed due to Ncipher failure:  The MAC service needs to be dependent on the Ncipher device.  The service should not start if the Ncipher is not verified  as being functional.  In addition, if the Ncipher fails, then the service should be shut down MAC attempted for machine not in MAC DB:  A user has tried to create an machine account for an Xbox who does not have information listed in the MAC DB.  This could be caused by a malicious user who is attempting to spoof an xbox or due to a breakdown in communication between the Genealogy DB and the MAC DB MAC attempted for <xxxxxxxxxxxx> and the account blocked flag is set:  User has tried to create a machine account for an Xbox where <xxxxxxxxxxxx> is the serial number of the box and the AccountBlocked flag is set in the MAC DB.  The flag could have been set due to machine sending malformed or altered packets to the service or an excessive number of creation attempts.  We should check to see if an attack is being launched against this box. MAC attempted for <xxxxxxxxxxxx> and account acknowledged flag is set:  User had tried to create a machine account for an Xbox where <xxxxxxxxxxxx> is the serial number, but the MAC DB is showing that the machine has already had an account created for it.  When the information from the Genealogy DB is moved into the MAC DB, the AccountAck, AccountBlocked, and the CreationAttempts are all set to null.  Upon first login and account creation, the AccountAck is set to the date that the account was created.  If this is already set, MAC assumes that someone is replaying credentials. Text Logging This section details the items that will be written to the text logs. Text logs are used as a record of interactions with Xboxes and other components of the Xbox Online service.  The text logs will be utilized for a number of purposes, including debugging and data mining. Text logs are not processed in real-time, therefore they cannot be used to trigger corrective or preventative action.  If that is necessary, an event should be written to the event log. Sample Text Log #Xbox Online Log Version 1.0 #Date: 01-01-2002 09:00:00 #Logged By: server, servicename 00:00:00, Xmacs connection established, xbox_id, Puid 00:00:02, Connection Dropped, client_ip (If possible), xbox,id, Reason (Where reason = Malformed packet, AccountBlkd, or CreationAttempts exceeded, Network, Component Dropped) Performance Counters The following counters will be added to monitor the Machine Account Provisioning server: Number of unsuccessful PP creations per hour Number of successful PP creations per hour Number of failed passport connections Number of machine accounts created since service start Number of non passport failures per hour Number of dropped connections per sec (If the server encounters malformed packets, account blocked flags, or excessive creation attempts, it automatically drops the connection to the xbox.  By having this counter, we can see at a glance how many are being dropped and can determine if DoS is being attempted) SetTextLoggingMode(mode) Where mode = Default, Verbose, Debug HeartBeat Checker Establishes and checks connections between various services to ensure reliability EventConsolidator Consolidates events to prevent event flooding Interactions This service has several interactions.   Genealogy database from manufacturing:  The genealogy database from the HOPS (Hardware Operations) team contains 4 entries that will be merged into the MAP DB. SerialNum: Unique key.  12 digit serial number  MaterialNum: Microsoft Part number  (SKU) OnlineKeyVer: Version of encryption key OnlineKey: 128 byte pk.  Base64 encoded to 172 bytes Passport:  A long term passport is created for the machine with the following naming   HYPERLINK "mailto:XXXXXXXXXXXX@machine.xbox.com"  XXXXXXXXXXXX@machine.xbox.com .  Where xxxxxxxxxxxx is the 12 digit serial number of the xbox. Refurb:  The refurb process is still up in the air.  Right now the thinking is to have a Refurbed Flag in the MAC Database that would allow MAC to take place even if an account has already been created for the box.   Machine Account Creation KDC The Machine Account Creation KDC (XMACs) receives the first request from an Xbox to create a machine account, create the Passport machine account and return account information and strong password to the Xbox.   Performance and Load Considerations This section should contain best estimates of how the feature will perform and impact the service once deployed.  This section should include (but is not limited to) items like the following: Average size of data transferred from Xbox to server and/or server to server Average size of data that is stored on the server by the feature The frequency of this data exchange Maximum data size allowed to be transferred / stored Number of data exchanges the servers will have to support over a given time (i.e. 50 requests / second) Setting message Manually set to immediately return error code One idea is to allow the Operations team to set a message manually that will get returned upon machine account creation attempts. Any messages displayed to the user will have to go through loc, but there are no TCRs required because this is our code. Errors and Alerts Kelly Altom: We should have a standard Alert ID (AID) that all documents reference.  In the ops Alert document, it would list the AID, description, immediate action and process.  This should be put into a  clickable  web interface so that our data center can walk through processes and click to find more information or run commands. Machine account creation attempted without valid credentials AID: 00000001 Description: XMACs received either a malformed packet or the encryption failed. Causes: A DDoS attack is being mounted against the KDC. The Online Key was encrypted with a different version of the public key at manufacturing than the private key stored in the nCipher device (rare) The format of a valid request changed but hasn t been updated on the server. The version of t. Immediate Action:  Watch network traffic to Machine Account Creation servers. Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be directed to call center by Xbox. Threat:  Possible DoS attack being mounted by PCs sending bogus credentials. Alert data: Source IP address Serial number of the request Flag whether the packet was malformed or the encryption failed Process: Contact product team with serial number and source IP address for investigation. Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials AID: 00000001 Immediate Action:  Watch network traffic to Machine Account Creation Front-Door servers. Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be directed to call center by Xbox. Threat:  Possible DoS attack being mounted by PCs replaying valid credentials. Alert data: Machine account information Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address (in packet) Process: Disable machine account in credentials if DoS attack is being performed. Contact product team with credentials sent for investigation. Passport Machine Account failure AID: 00000001 Description: Passport cannot create a machine account with the name nnnnnnnnnnnn.xmacs@xbox.com where nnnnnnnnnnnn is the 12-digit serial number. Causes: Passport is down or offline. Account name already exists. Data center problems at Passport (disk space, failures, etc) preventing account creation. Our User and Offerings Database did not record the Passport machine account creation and tried to create a machine account twice. Immediate Action:  See if Passport is up and contact Passport data center if not up. Check if serial number already exists in our User and Offerings Database and alert Passport that this machine account should be able to be created. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be told to  try again later Threat:  (Rare) possible spoofing attack being mounted by PCs replaying valid credentials with a serial number that already exists in the Passport database. Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address (in packet) MAC address Process: Check Passport. Disable machine account in credentials if spoofing attack is being performed. Contact product team with credentials sent for investigation. User and Offerings Database write failure AID: 00000001 Description: XMACs cannot set the  account acknowledged  field for the machine account into our UODB and therefore cannot create a machine account for a valid user. Causes: Our database is not able to write data (disk space, failures, etc) preventing account creation. Immediate Action:  Check what is happening with our UODB. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will be told to  try again later Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Source IP address Internal IP address Process: Check our UODB. nCipher device not responding AID: 00000001 Description: XMACs cannot communicate with its nCipher device.  The device might need a reset, to be power-cycled or replaced. Causes: Lock up or failure of nCipher device. Immediate Action:  Check XMACs machine operation. Get operator smart card out of safe. How is this done?  What is the process? Take XMACs offline and restart nCipher. Can you restart the nCipher device without taking the machine down?  Is it external? Restart XMACs. Replace nCipher with backup unit. Order another nCipher device.  How is this done?  What is the process? A new nCipher device must be procured and initialized to match the scalability requirements (with a minimum of 2 active devices online in case of failover) with 2 more backups owned by dev and test, respectively. What the valid user sees: Valid users attempting to create a machine account will eventually try another XMACs or will be told to  try again later  if no XMACs can operate. Alert data: Serial number of Xbox Server name of XMACs Server IP address Scalability of the nCipher devices The consistent load on a device is no more than 50%.  This is determined through perfmon statistics. User and Offerings Database The User and Offerings Database (UODB) is a SQL server that contains the machine account creation information.   Router Filter A router filter will be placed in front of XMACs that will check for malformed packets.  If a packed is received that is not in the format of a Kerberos AS-request, the packet will be dropped and no reply will be sent. Refurbishment There will be several Xbox Repair/Refurbishment centers distributed throughout the world, and in the repair/refurbishment process, an Xbox could easily get its motherboard or hard drive replaced. Because the hard drive is locked with the hard drive key, each refurbished Xbox that wants to use a used hard drive will need to have its original hard drive burned into EEPROM of the new. This means that the genealogy database needs to record the hard drive key and be present at these refurbishment centers.  This needs to happen anyway for other reasons.  Refurbishment is documented in a separate spec. Dependencies Manufacturing and Hardware Operations (HOPS) Contact: Arch Holder The HOPS team needs to provide periodic updates of manufacturing information to the Xbox team. Schedule The first drop of manufacturing data will happen immediately after the first Xbox consoles roll off of the line.  We might not be able to fix those due to cost if there is something wrong.  We will have to rely upon manual account creation through our call center.  These call center operations are covered in a separate document. KDC core Contact: John Brezak Schedule The milestone for delivery of our Stand-Alone KDC is 9/15/2001. nCipher Devices and Smartcards Contact: Walt Dorsey Schedule Xbox team has already received 6 nCipher devices and the smart cards necessary. Dashboard requirements Account Sign-up Account sign-up is in another document. Machine Reset and Hard Disk Recovery The hardware team has taken care of this and will be monitored by the Xbox call center. Product Support User account Sign-up User account sign-up is in another document. Machine Account Reset Before any online authentication can be performed, an Xbox account needs to first be created in order to bootstrap the Xbox online authentication process. Both Xbox accounts and user accounts can only be created through the Xbox Dashboard. If an Xbox account key is ever suspected of being compromised, an administrator can reset the Xbox account key and subsequent attempts to logon from that Xbox will force an account key reset and renewal of credentials to the Xbox.  An administrator can also set the BlockedDate of a machine account which will prevent an Xbox from resetting its own credentials. Hard drive key We want to lock the contents of each Xbox hard drive so that malicious users cannot read the contents of the hard drive on a PC.  However, we do not want the key to lock the hard drive to be the same for all Xbox consoles because one person who broke their key can advertise how to unlock other hard drives.  In order to solve this problem we generate a random hard drive key for each Xbox manufactured.  The hard drive key is 16 bytes long. The hard drive key will be written into the EEPROM on the Xbox motherboard at manufacturing time. The ROM loader will use the key to unlock the hard drive during each Xbox initialization.  The key will also need to be recorded into the genealogy database at manufacturing time because repair facilities need it to unlock the hard drive of an Xbox with a motherboard problem. Recovery Key If an end user gets their Xbox hard drive into an inconsistent state, the user will need to recover the hard drive back to a state that will allow the Xbox to function again.  The Xbox will clear the user and game data from the hard drive.  There is some information that persists between recovery and is not covered in this document.  We do not want any user to arbitrarily recover their hard drive since they might not be aware of the consequences.  The solution is to have a random button press sequence generated for each Xbox that our call center will tell the user when they wish to perform a hard drive recovery operation.  The user will be told recovery sequence for their particular box by calling our support center and after being educated on the consequences of this operation.  The button sequence is recorded in the manufacturing genealogy database so that Call Center Support staff can access it. The Recovery Key will be recorded in the genealogy database using 8 bytes of data. Each byte will be an ASCII character having one of the following 9 values: : The A button should be pressed. : The X button should be pressed. : The Y button should be pressed. : The up button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The down button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The left button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The right button on the direction pad should be pressed. : The zero byte represents that no more characters are in the sequence. Note:   is intentionally omitted because it is  The zero bytes will only be present at the end of the 8 byte string. The current plan is to only require 4 button presses, thus the trailing 4 bytes will always be  . The button press sequence is derived from the hard drive key using an algorithm, thus making it unnecessary to record this button press sequence into the EEPROM. Generating, Writing and Verifying machine-specific data An Xbox goes through the system integration test phase after it has been completely assembled.  A system integration test computer communicates through the Ethernet port with both the newly assembled Xbox and with a central genealogy database located in the factory.  The system integration test computer collects and generates the unique data per machine and sends this data to the Xbox and genealogy database to be recorded.  Software running on the Xbox writes this data into the Xbox EEPROM along with various checksums.  The system level test computer will verify these checksums during a later test phase. The Xbox software team will deliver to the System Level Test Software Development team three software routines that correctly generate, write and verify the machine-specific data. Contact for the System Level Test Software Development team is Brad Inman of Intel.  The development of System Level Test Software will transition to the Xbox team sometime after launch. The System Level Test Software Development team will incorporate these routines into the system integration test and extended test phases of the manufacturing process.  GeneratePerBoxData The Xbox software team will create a Win32 library (GenPerBoxData.lib) that contains a single function called GeneratePerBoxData. The system integration test computer uses this function to generate the binary array containing the machine-specific data.  HRESULT GeneratePerBoxData (     IN DWORD GameRegion,     IN DWORD AVRegion,     IN LPBYTE pbMACAddress, // 6 bytes     IN LPCHAR pcXboxSerialNumber, // 12 bytes     OUT LPBYTE pbHardDriveKey // 25 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPCHAR pcRecoveryKey // 8 bytes     OUT DWORD* pdwOnlineKeyVersion     OUT LPBYTE pbOnlineKey // 173 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPBYTE pbOutputBuffer,     IN OUT DWORD* pdwOutputBufferSize,     ); The game region, TV region, the 6 byte Ethernet MAC address, and the Xbox serial number is passed into the routine and the routine will generate an array of data that is sent to the Xbox and passed into the function WritePerBoxData to be written on the EEPROM.  The system integration test computer sends the hard drive key, recovery key, online key version and online key to the genealogy database. The online key encryption process is here: Xbox-Machine-Specific-Data-Spec.doc WritePerBoxData The Xbox software team will create an Xbox library (WritePerBoxData.lib) that contains two functions called WritePerBoxData and VerifyPerBoxData. The Xbox uses the WritePerBoxData function to write the binary array containing the machine-specific data to EEPROM. HRESULT WritePerBoxData (     IN LPBYTE pbInputBuffer,     IN DWORD dwInputBufferSize     ); This routine takes the buffer of data generated by GeneratePerBoxData, formats the information, computes checksums and writes the result into the EEPROM. VerifyPerBoxData The Xbox calls the VerifyPerBoxData function in the Xbox library (WritePerBoxData.lib) as the last function during manufacturing to read the data on the EEPROM and verify that the checksums are valid, lock the hard drive and to clear the manufacturing region code that allows system test software. HRESULT VerifyPerBoxData (); Deleted RepairDate from the Genealogy DB. User and Offerings Database Lookup If the serial number is valid, XMACs will query the following fields through a SQL command to the separate server containing the UODB: SerialNum CreationBlockedDate AccessedDate CreationAttempts The following figure shows the logic flow for the XMACs.  The first check is whether the SerialNum is found in the UODB.  If the SerialNum is not in the UODB, the machine account has not been created and therefore XMACs will create the machine account and return it to the Xbox. If the record is in the UODB, the  CreationAttempts  is incremented and the XMACs runs a second check.  If the  CreationBlockedDate  field is set, the data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.    EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   The next check is if this account has been blocked due to a possible attack by checking the  CreationAttempts  field.  If this is over 20, a possible DDoS replay attack of credentials is being mounted or a spoofing attempt by a PC is being performed.  The data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  The  BlockedDate  field for this serial number should be set in the UODB. The XMACs then checks the  AccessedDate  field to see if the machine account has ever been signed-in with.  If the date is null, the machine account has been created but valid credentials may not have been received by the Xbox.  XMACs resets the Passport machine account password.  If the  AccessedDate  field has been set, the machine account has previously signed-in and valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are maybe being replayed .  The last check is to see if the Xbox has been refurbished and if so whether it was refurbished after the last time the machine account was successfully signed-in.  If the  AccessedDate  field is greater than the  RepairDate  field then the data center will be alerted that valid   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_1"  credentials are being replayed .  No reply should be sent and the connection should be terminated.  Otherwise, the Passport machine account password is reset.  In all cases, the  CreationAttempts  will be incremented in the UODB. Security:  Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials The connection will be dropped on the server without sending any information back to the Xbox.  Valid users will timeout and be directed to our call center by the Xbox.  An alert will be signaled:   HYPERLINK  \l "_AID_00000002:_Machine_account creat"  Alert: Machine account creation attempted twice with valid credentials The credentials passed to create a machine account were valid but for an existing account.  This has these possible causes in order of likelihood: A hacker has attempted to replay information. The valid machine information created at a refurbishing facility has been duplicated across separate consoles. The valid machine information created at the factory has been duplicated across separate consoles. An invalid Xbox has been created by a compromise of the manufacturing security. PC Spoofing Attempt A hacker is attempting to replay credentials to either gain authentication or to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Denial_of_Service_from Account Crea"  deny service to the Machine Account Creation Servers  by taking up resources to validate the credentials.  This is similar to   HYPERLINK  \l "_Machine_account_creation_attempted _2"  sending bogus credentials Valid machine information created by a refurbishment center and entered into our database twice A valid, but refurbished Xbox is attempting machine account creation but it is in our database already.   The process to populate unique credentials created by the refurbishment center has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Valid machine information created by the factory and entered into our database twice A valid Xbox is attempting machine account creation but is not in our database.   The process to populate unique credentials created by the factory has broken down and must be investigated.  The user will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on. The process for call-center manual sign on is TBD. Invalid Xbox Manufacturing security of the Xbox creation process has broken down and the rogue Xbox is attempting to create a machine account.  This should be a very rare scenario.  Since the user will have to subscribe to the service, however, they will be directed to our call center by the Xbox and they will have to manually sign them on.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. <<Spec Name>> Title<<Spec Name>> ravim Template - Quick Spec dinartem Microsoft Word 9.0]8"2^ 0l|pJ V&&cVF Xbox-Key-ExchangeXbox Key Exchange Author: Tony Chen, Dinarte Morais Introduction In an effort to deter cheating, retasking, mapping, denial of service, and other forms of malicious attacks on the Xbox through the Ethernet port, all Xbox to Xbox and Xbox to server communication will use the IPSec ESP format to authenticate and optionally encrypt the contents of each packet.  The purpose of this document is to describe the layout of each packet type transmitted by an Xbox, the algorithms used to secure these packets, the state machine run by each endpoint, as well as the specific encryption, authentication, and transformations performed to the data and keys, including how each type of key is generated. For now this document will concentrate solely on System Link Play, which is defined as two or more Xboxes connected via an Ethernet cross cable, or via an Ethernet bridge.  It is assumed that all such Xboxes can be reached via Ethernet broadcast, and that these Xboxes will only communicate with other Xboxes and not with any sort of server, including DHCP or DNS servers, or routers.  Future versions of this document will describe Online Play, which will make use of all of these services. Random Number Generation For the purpose of generating random keys, nonces, initialization vectors, and DH exponents, the Xbox Secure Networking Library uses the following algorithm.  At XNet initialization time, we gather randomness from the disk, memory, and EEPROM values of the Xbox.  We fill a vector of bytes with values such as the tick count, system time, performance counter, system memory status, hard disk free space, and hard disk model and serial number.  Then we read a special sector on the hard disk (sector 8, also known as the first config sector) that is reserved for the random number generator.  The sector contains a 20-byte digest that we add to the vector of bytes we are generating.  We perform a SHA-1 hash of all of these bytes to generate a 20-byte digest.  This digest is used to initialize an RC4 machine.  The RC4 machine is then used to generate a new 20-byte digest, and this digest is written to the sector on the hard disk for use the next time the network stack is initialized.  To generate random numbers, we simply run the RC4 machine as much as necessary to produce the number of bytes requested.  Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) When we talk about sending and receiving packets, we mean packets that are formatted in conformance with RFC 2406 with a slight twist.  The RFC defines an IP packet that has been transformed into an ESP packet having the ESP header immediately following the IP header.  In our case, we insert a UDP header just before the ESP header.  The format of a secure ESPUDP packet is shown below. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IP] |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                        Source Address                         | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                     Destination Address                       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESP] |                 Security Parameters Index (SPI)               | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  |                        Sequence Number                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [IV] |                Encryption Initialization Vector               | |           (Added only if packet is being encrypted)           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [UDP] |         Source Port           |        Destination Port       | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |             Length            |            Checksum           | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [Payload] ~                            Payload                            ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ [ESPT] ~       Padding (variable)      |  Pad Length   |  Next Header  | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                Authentication Data (12-bytes)                 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ The format of a secure TCP packet will be the same except that the second [UDP] header will be a [TCP] header.  Note that the initialization vector is only added to a packet that is encrypted.  The encrypted portion of the packet begins just after the initialization vector and ends just before the Authentication Data. Whether the packet is encrypted or not, it will always end with 12-bytes of Authentication Data, which is the first 12-bytes of the digest produced by performing a keyed HMAC-SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet starting at [ESP] and ending just before the Authentication Data.  If the packet is encrypted, encryption occurs first, then the encrypted contents are hashed. An important point to keep in mind from a security perspective is that the [IP] header and the outer [UDP] header are neither authenticated nor encrypted.  We must therefore assume that any or all of these fields can be spoofed by the sender, or modified in transit. The reason for adding the outer [UDP] header is to force all packets to use exactly one UDP source port no matter how many actual source ports the title uses.  This is an important consideration for future online play when communicating through Network Address Translators (NAT).  For System Link Play it is of little value, but since we will need this header in the near future, we decided to standardize the packet format now with this requirement. System Link Shared Secret Each title that is certified to play on an Xbox contains a unique randomly generated title key that can be found in the encrypted portion of the XBE (Xbox executable) certificate.   This key is the same for every copy of the same title, but is different on different titles, and is 16-bytes long.  We assume that the XBE certificate is somewhat difficult to read because the DVD format of an Xbox game is not readable with today s DVD drives, but it is certainly readable with any Xbox development kit, and no doubt will be easily readable in the future.  We cannot assume that the title key in the certificate will remain secret, therefore, since the certificate itself can be decrypted with a public key that exists in the ROM and will no doubt be widely available soon enough. In order to bootstrap the key exchange process, we need to come up with a shared secret that only an Xbox running a given title will know.  This shared secret will be used to authenticate the Xbox to another Xbox and to encrypt broadcast traffic between these Xboxes during the host discovery phase before key exchange has taken place.   This shared secret is computed by in two phases.  The XBE loader does the first phase by computing an HMAC-SHA-1 operation on the 16-byte key found in the XBE certificate using a key stored in the ROM.  We call this key the LAN key.  When the network stack is initialized, we perform two HMAC-SHA-1 operations on constant 16-byte strings using this LAN key to produce two 20-byte digests.  The first 16-bytes of the digests is used as the title broadcast SHA key, and the remaining 24-bytes is used as the title broadcast 3DES key.  This 3DES key will have its parity bits set correctly. The process of generating the title broadcast keys is done once at XNet initialization time.  All Xboxes running the same title will generate the same pair of keys.  Any Xbox running a different title on the same network will have a different pair of keys.   We presume that it is somewhat difficult for a non-Xbox to figure out what these keys are.  Due to their fixed nature, however, it only needs to be discovered once and then the title broadcast keys are compromised forever for that particular title.  XNKID and XNKEY There may be more than one Xbox hosting a game session at any given time.  While this is unlikely when there are only a handful of Xboxes connected on a small local network, in the future the number of available game sessions will be quite large, and a dedicated matchmaking service will be responsible for finding a suitable match. We distinguish between different sessions by defining an XNKID, or XNet Key Identifier, and an XNKEY, or XNet Key Exchange Key.  The XNKID is simply a name for the XNKEY.  The format of these data structures is shown below. typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[8];                      // key identifier } XNKID; typedef struct {     BYTE        ab[16];                     // key exchange key } XNKEY; A title which is hosting a game session generates an XNKID / XNKEY pair by calling the function XNetCreateKey.  This implementation of this function simply runs the random number generator to fill in both structures. A pair of Xboxes that want to communicate will have to obtain the same XNKID / XNKEY pairs (we describe how below) and each must call XNetRegisterKey with these values.  Once registered, you can think of the Xbox as listening for incoming key-exchange requests from other Xboxes on this XNKID.  Once a game session is finished, the title calls XNetUnregisterKey to stop accepting key-exchange requests from any Xbox using this XNKID / XNKEY pair.  The duration of a XNKID / XNKEY pair will be anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours at most. The XNKEY part of the pair is used to authenticate the contents of key exchange packets (described below).  The XNKID is carried in the payload of the key exchange packet to specify which game session the source Xbox is connecting to, and the corresponding XNKEY is used to compute a SHA-1 hash of the contents of the packet.  If the target Xbox has registered the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, it will have an entry in its table of registered keys and will therefore be able to compute the same SHA-1 hash to authenticate the packet. The actual key used for key-exchange packet authentication is not the XNKEY directly.  When the title calls XNetRegisterKey with the XNKID and XNKEY, we compute a SHA key by performing a keyed HMAC operation on the XNKID and XNKEY using the title broadcast SHA key as the key.  The reason for this is that both the XNKID and XNKEY will be transmitted (presumably encrypted) between hosts somehow.  Should the XNKEY be discovered, most likely because a title developer forgot to read the part of the Technical Certification Requirements document making it clear that an XNKEY must never be transmitted unencrypted, the key used to authenticate key-exchange packets is still somewhat protected because the observer would also have to figure out the title broadcast SHA key for the particular title. XNADDR The Xbox Secure Networking Library extends the notion of a network address from a simple four-byte IP address to a structure of type XNADDR.  The format of an XNADDR is shown below. typedef struct {     BYTE        bSizeOfStruct;              // sizeof(XNADDR)     BYTE        bFlags;                     // XNET_XNADDR_* flags below     BYTE        abEnet[6];                  // Ethernet MAC address of the host     IN_ADDR     ina;                        // IP address of the host } XNADDR; #define XNET_XNADDR_RESERVED        0xFF    // No flags currently defined The size of this structure will be increased in the future for Online Play.  In addition to all the fields it currently has, it will also include the IP address and Port assigned by a NAT that is between the host and the Internet (if any), the IP address and Port assigned by the Connection Server that the Xbox is connected to (details of Connection Servers is beyond the scope of this document), and potentially other IP addresses to be determined. The reason for this level of abstraction is because the IP address of an Xbox, especially one that is behind a NAT, is not enough to establish connectivity.   Many different Xboxes could be configured with the same IP address 10.0.0.1, for example, yet each has a unique external IP address assigned by the NAT.  In the case of System Link Play, an Xbox will not even have an IP address at all.  It will only have an Ethernet MAC address.  This address is also carried in the XNADDR structure.  Besides being useful for addressing Ethernet frames, it is also a useful unique identifier of the Xbox that we will use in the key exchange state machine described later. For security reasons, we would like to keep the contents of an XNADDR hidden from the casual observer since it contains addressing information that would be useful to a hacker, so any packet that contains one or more of these structures must be encrypted.  Just because an XNADDR is transmitted to an Xbox doesn t mean that the Xbox will establish communication with that address.  It might have gotten a whole list of XNADDR to different potential game hosts and will only end up picking one.  While there is no way to prevent the hacker from seeing which IP address is being used by examining the IP packets, we don t want to give the hacker any more information about other Xbox addresses than is absolutely necessary. System Link Broadcast After a title initializes XNet, the next step is to discover if there are any other Xboxes running the same title that are hosting a game session.  Because there is no third-party matchmaking service available in System Link Play, the title must use Ethernet broadcast to perform this discovery. The discovery process involves a game host calling XNetCreateKey to generate a unique XNKID / XNKEY pair, calling XNetRegisterKey, opening a UDP socket and listening for discovery broadcasts from one or more clients.  The response to the discovery broadcast is a response packet (also transmitted via broadcast) which contains (at a minimum) the XNKID / XNKEY pair as well as the XNADDR of the game host.  When the client receives the response, it calls XNetRegisterKey with the same XNKID / XNKEY pair, and then calls XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR into an IP address that can be used like to communicate with the host. Because these discovery packets contain XNKEY and XNADDR structures, they must be encrypted.  The XNet stack automatically encrypts and authenticates any packet sent via broadcast by using the title broadcast SHA key and title broadcast 3DES key described earlier.  Using this discovery process, a game client can discover the list of game hosts available on the network and can choose which it wishes to communicate with by calling XNetRegisterKey with the XNKID / XNKEY pair of the chosen host.  All other XNKID / XNKEY pairs should be discarded.  Key Exchange After game session discovery we now have two Xboxes that share a title broadcast SHA key, a title broadcast 3DES key, as well as a XNKID / XNKEY pair.  Each Xbox has called XNetRegisterKey with its XNKID / XNKEY pair, and the game client has called XNetXnAddrToInAddr to convert the XNADDR of the game host into an IP address. For the purpose of key exchange, let us consider the game client to be the initiator or the key exchange, and the game host to be the responder.  When the game client sends the first packet to the IP address obtained by the call to XNetXnAddrToInAddr, the XNet stack notices that there is no security association established between the game client and game host.  This means that there are no SHA or DES keys that are required to compute the authentication hash and optionally to encrypt the packet.  The packet is placed on a packet queue and the key exchange process is started. When XNetRegisterKey is called with an XNKID / XNKEY pair, a CKeyReg structure is allocated and filled.     struct CKeyReg     {         XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier         BYTE            _abKeySha[16];      // key exchange SHA auth key         BYTE            _abDhX[CBDHLEN];    // diffie-hellman X value         BYTE            _abDhGX[CBDHLEN];   // diffie-hellman g^X value     }; In addition to remembering the XNKID, it also holds the computed SHA key exchange key (which is different than XNKEY as described earlier).  Further, it is at this time that the Diffie-Hellman X value is randomly generated and the g^X value is computed.  The client will use the same X and g^X values for every key-exchange peer that mentions this XNKID.  When XNetXnAddrToInAddr is called with an XNADDR and a XNKID, a CSecReg structure is allocated and filled. struct CSecReg     DWORD           _dwSpiRecv;         // SPI assigned by this side     DWORD           _dwSpiXmit;         // SPI assigned by other side     DWORD           _dwSeqXmit;         // Highest sequence number transmitted     DWORD           _dwSeqRecv;         // Base sequence of receive window     DWORD           _dwSeqMask;         // Bit mask of sequence numbers received     BYTE            _bState;            // Connection state     BYTE            _bRetry;            // Number of retries remaining     BYTE            _bUnused[2];        // Unused     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;            // Highest time value from destination     CPacketQueue    _pqWait;            // Queue of packets waiting      CTimer          _timer;             // Timer for scheduling timeouts     BYTE            _abNonce[8];        // Nonce generated by this side     BYTE            _abIv[8];           // Next IV to use for encrypted packets     BYTE            _abKeyShaRecv[16];  // Negotiated incoming SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyShaXmit[16];  // Negotiated outgoing SHA auth key     BYTE            _abKeyDesRecv[8];   // Negotiated incoming DES crypt key     BYTE            _abKeyDesXmit[8];   // Negotiated outgoing DES crypt key     CKeyReg *       _pkeyreg;           // Pointer to corresponding CKeyReg     XNADDR          _xnaddr;            // XNADDR of the destination #define SR_STATE_IDLE           0       // key exchange not started  #define SR_STATE_INITSENT       1       // initiator packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_RESPSENT       2       // response packet has been sent #define SR_STATE_INITWAIT       3       // initiator waiting for responder #define SR_STATE_READY          4       // key exchange is complete This structure describes a security association between this host and the host with the given XNADDR.  There will be one security association for every unique XNADDR / XNKID pair.  We use the Ethernet address in the XNADDR structure to determine unique address, as it remains fixed to the Xbox whereas the IP address can be reassigned. A key-exchange packet is a UDP packet whose payload contains the following data. struct CKeyExMsg     DWORD           _dwSpiZero;         // Must be zero     DWORD           _dwSpiInit;         // SPI of the initiator     DWORD           _dwSpiResp;         // SPI of the responder     BYTE            _abNonceInit[8];    // Nonce of the initiator     BYTE            _abNonceResp[8];    // Nonce of the responder     BYTE            _abDhGX[CBDHLEN];   // diffie-hellman g^X (or g^Y)     XNKID           _xnkid;             // key identifier     XNADDR          _xnaddr;            // XNADDR of the sender of this message     LARGE_INTEGER   _liTime;            // increasing time-value of the sender     BYTE            _abHash[12];        // HMAC-SHA-1-96 digest of CKeyExMsg The dwSpiZero field must be zero to distinguish this message from a standard ESPUDP message.  The first field of an ESP header is the SPI value that can never be zero.  If it is zero, then we know this is a key exchange message.  The dwSpiInit field is the SPI value assigned by the initiator for this security association.  The responder will place this value in the SPI field of all packets sent to the initiator.  The dwSpiResp field is the SPI value assigned by the responder for this security association.  The initiator will place this value in the SPI field for all packets sent to the responder.  The abNonceInit and abNonceResp fields are random nonces created by the initiator and responder, respectively.  These are used to validate responses and when computing the actual SHA and DES keys.   The g^X field is the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation provided by the sender of the message.  The XNKID field specifies the key identifier that both the initiator and responder should have obtained out-of-band and registered.  The XNADDR field contains the complete addressing information of the sender of the message.   The liTime field is a 64-bit time value that is used to limit replay attacks.  When the XNet stack is initialized, the number of 100ns periods since January 1, 1601 UTC is remembered (also known as the SYSTEMTIME).  Every time a key exchange packet it transmitted (or retransmitted for timeouts), this value is incremented by one unit (one 100ns period), and that time is transmitted in the key exchange packet.  Should the initiator or responder reboot and attempt to rejoin the same game session (because it reacquired the same XNKID / XNKEY pair from the game host via broadcast when it came back up), its system time will have moved forward by many thousands if not millions of units.  The purpose of this scheme is to prevent the replay of key exchange initiator packets disrupting the security association between a pair of Xboxes.   Finally, the abHash field contains the HMAC-SHA-1-96 digest of the entire message using the SHA key associated with the given XNKID. There are three distinct forms of this message: KeyExInit, KeyExResp, and KeyExAck.  The KeyExInit message is sent by the initiator while in state SR_STATE_INITSENT.  The KeyExResp message is sent by the responder while in the state SR_STATE_RESPSENT as a response to a KeyExInit message.  The KeyExAck message is sent by the initiator while in the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT in response to a KeyExResp message. The initiator of the key exchange assigns a dwSpiInit value, generates a random abNonceInit, fills in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fills in the XNKID and XNADDR fields, and increments and sets the liTime field.  All other fields are zeroed.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the XNKID and sent to the responder. KeyExInit: [dwSpiInit, 0, abNonceInit, 0, g^X, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] When this message is received, the responder will use the XNKID field to find the corresponding SHA key to authenticate this message.  The responder will then allocate and fill a new CSecReg structure, assign a dwSpiResp value, generate a random abNonceResp, fill in its pre-computed g^X value (from the CKeyReg record), fill in the XNKID and XNADDR field, and increment and set the liTime field.  The dwSpiInit and abNonceInit fields are copied from the initiator message.  The message is then hashed with the SHA key associated with the XNKID and sent to the initiator.  KeyExResp: [dwSpiInit, dwSpiResp, abNonceInit, abNonceResp, g^X, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] The responder at this time has enough data to compute the security association keys.  It takes the initiators g^Y value and using its own X value from the CKeyReg structure, computes g^XY.  It then computes four digests by calling HMAC-SHA with a single byte value (0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, for the respective digests), abNonceInit , abNonceResp, and g^XY as input, using the SHA key associated with the XNKID as the key.   The first 16 (SHA) or 8 (DES) bytes of these digests are copied into abKeyShaXmit, abKeyDesXmit, abKeyShaRecv, and abKeyDesRecv, respectively.  The DES keys have their parity set appropriately. When the initiator receives the KeyExResp message, it performs the same computation to generate the security association keys.  The Xmit and Recv keys are swapped so that they match the ones calculated by the other side.   Once the initiator has these keys, it is free to transmit any packets that have been waiting for key exchange to complete.  The responder, however, is not free to do so even though it has the same set of keys because it cannot be sure that its KeyExResp message was not lost.  The responder will remain in the SR_STATE_RESPSENT until it either receives a KeyExAck message or until it receives an ESPUDP packet authenticated with the computed SHA key.  In the common case, the initiator has a packet it wishes to send to the other side, so the key exchange process will consist of just two messages.  Should the initiator not have a packet to send, it will send an artificial KeyExAck message.  This message differs from the two other key exchange messages in that the message is hashed using the computed SHA key (abKeyShaXmit) of the security association instead of the SHA key associated with the XNKID.  This message is distinguished by having a zero dwSpiInit and a non-zero dwSpiResp. KeyExAck: [0, dwSpiResp, 0, 0, 0, xnkid, xnaddr, liTime] When the initiator receives the KeyExResp message, it enters the state SR_STATE_INITWAIT.  It will remain in this state responding to KeyExResp messages with KeyExAck messages.  As soon as it receives an ESPUDP packet authenticated with the computed SHA key it enters the SR_STATE_READY state and stops responding to any key exchange message except for KeyExInit. The following table describes the key exchange state machine.  Note that if both sides initiate key exchange at the same time, the one with the larger Ethernet address will be chosen as the initiator and the other will become the responder.  Each side will have the Eth  biggest immediate concern is the amount of time it takes to compute g^XY.  On an Xbox it currently takes 13 ms per exponentiation using the Oakley Group 1 modulus (768 bits).  The problem is that these 13 ms are assuming 100% CPU utilization, and at the time we receive the key exchange packet the system is running at DPC level, which means that all user threads are suspended until the computation completes. If we try to chunk this operation into smaller pieces, we would first need an algorithm that would let us do it, or we could compute g^X as (g^X1^X2^X3^X4), with smaller X1   X4 values.  But the total amount of time needed will be the same (or slightly greater).  Further, the state machine for key exchange would become more complicated because there will be a state between INITSENT and INITWAIT during which the key computation is being performed.  Packets will have to be queued waiting for it to complete.  Should the initiator complete its asynchronous computation ahead of the responder and beings transmitting packets using the newly computed SHA and DES keys, the responder will be forced to either synchronously finish the computation of the keys as soon as it receives the packet, or it will have to enqueue a copy of these packets on a queue for later processing once the asynchronous key computation is complete.  It d like to avoid this type of complexity. The question is, what is the smallest modulus we can get away with?  I would like one that is large enough to prevent an observer from being able to compute the keys in real time.  Given that these Xbox to Xbox keys will only be used from as little as 10 minutes to at most several hours, we only need a modulus that prevents someone from brute forcing the exponentiation computation that long.  Will 256-bits do the trick?  How about 512-bits?

The target audience of this document is Cryptography/Security experts within the company, and the document assumes knowledge of various cryptographic functions as well as Kerberos. The goal of this document is to solicit feedback on possible security holes within the Xbox online authentication system. This document only discusses the details relating to Kerberos and using it to bootstrap machine authentication and user authentication. After Kerberos authentication, the Kerberos AP request and AP reply is used within Key Exchange packets to the Xbox security gateway (SG) which is discussed in more detail in another document. Introduction The security of the Xbox Online system relies on several 128 bit symmetric keys being shared between the Xbox client and the KDC servers within our data center, and using the knowledge of these keys to mutually authenticate each other during the logon process. The first key used is what we call the Xbox  Online Key . This is a unique key written to the Xbox EEPROM during the manufacturing process. The Xbox serial number and online key pair is used to authenticate the Xbox in order to create a  machine account . A Kerberos AS request is used for this machine account creation process, and it requires a special encrypted Pre-Auth containing information about the newly created machine account in the AS reply. The server used in the process is referred to as the MACS (machine account creation server) KDC Server. Mutual authentication is performed on the client, so if the server does not know the pre-shared online key, it will not be able to make the client accept (and store) the new machine account. The serial number and online key pair is collected at all Xbox manufacturing sites and the online key is encrypted with a public key at the manufacturing site before being stored into a database which is then transported to the Xbox online data center. The corresponding private key is held in several nCipher devices that are used on the MACS servers during machine account creation. After a machine account is created, a regular Kerberos authentication cycle can be carried out to authenticate the Xbox machine account to the Xbox online system using the AS KDC and the TGS KDC (we will refer to the servers as the ASKDC and the XKDC). A ticket is finally granted to talk to an SG and a key exchange is performed with the SG (using the granted ticket) to establish a secure channel between the Xbox and the SG. Using this secure channel, the Xbox can talk to the User Account Creation Service (UACS) behind the SG using the previously established SG secure channel. Within this secure channel, we send the users credit card information up to the UACS server, and a new set of user credentials (i.e. the user key) is sent down to the Xbox. All this traffic is triple DES encrypted between the Xbox and the SG via the secure channel. At this point both a machine account and possibly several user accounts have been created, and a Kerberos authentication process using compound-identities can be performed to obtain a Kerberos ticket that proves authenticity of both the machine account and multiple user accounts. This ticket contains custom auth-data that enumerates the PUIDs (Passport Unique Identifier) of all the authenticated accounts. After a key exchange with the SG, the SG will associate this auth-data information with the secure channel and forward it to any backend services that request it. At the point, the goal of authentication has been achieved: We authenticate (verify knowledge of key) each and every Xbox identity that wishes to particulate in the online gaming session and we provide the backend services with a means to access the KDC verified identities. Encryption Notation In order to simplify the description of the way various messages and keys are computed, we will introduce the following notation: Digest = SHA1 (M) Digest is the 20 byte SHA1 hash of the message M. Digest = MD5 (M) Digest is the 16 byte MD5 hash of the message M. Digest = SHA1-HMAC (K, M) Digest is the 20 byte SHA1-HMAC (according to IETF RFC 2104) of the message M using the key K. Digest = MD5-HMAC (K, M) Digest is the 16 byte MD5-HMAC (according to IETF RFC 2104) of the message M using the key K. EncryptedMessage = EType (K, M) EncryptedMessage is the encrypted form of Message M using the key K to encrypt. The   of the encryption is usually DES, 3DES, or RC4-HMAC. General Issues Encryption Algorithm The only Kerberos encryption system the Xbox client will support is the  RC4-HMAC  crypto system. The only checksum system used is the MD5 checksum. All keys and checksums will be 16 bytes long. Only   are stored and used within our system. No  password  is ever generated and transformed into a Key. The client does not examine the encryption method used to encrypt the tickets; it is up to the various KDCs and Xbox services to determine the encryption system of the tickets. For now we are only using RC4-HMAC for ticket encryption also. Addition Pre-Auth Information Several new pre-auth types have been added to perform the extra tasks needed during Xbox logon. Most of these pre-auth structures are encrypted with the session key in the TGT if it is in a TGS request, otherwise they will be encrypted with the client key. A different encryption salt is used for each of these pre-auth structures. Most of these pre-auth structures are direct in memory structures with all multi-byte fields stored in little endian format. The Hard Drive Key A unique hard drive key is stored in the EEPROM of each manufactured Xbox along with the online key. All sensitive data that is stored on an Xbox hard drive is signed with this hard drive key. For even more sensitive data, we use the hard drive key to encrypt the stored data. The hard drive key and the online key of each Xbox should typically be unknown to the owner of the Xbox. A user would need to open up the Xbox and perform a hardware sniff at the correct pins to obtain the value of the hard drive key for their Xbox. Doing so would only compromise the keys for that particular Xbox and would not compromise the keys for any other unit. Storing Machine and User Keys on the Hard Drive Machine and User accounts are stored in the configuration sectors of the hard drive before the file system header. Each account is represented by a structure that contains the Kerberos principal name and realm name along with the principal key. Each stored structure is HMAC signed with the hard drive key as follows: AccountStructSignature = SHA1-HMAC (HardDriveKey, EntireAccountStructure) And then the actual 16 byte principal key within the structure is encrypted using the hard drive key as follows: First4BytesOf3DESKey = First4bytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey1, HardDriveKey)) Last20BytesOf3DESKey = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey2, HardDriveKey) EncryptedPrincipalKey = E3DES (3DESKey, UnencryptedPrincipalKey) A triple DES key is first generated using 2 separate HMACs on the hard drive key using fixed (but randomly generated) keys as the HMAC key. Then a triple DES encryption in CBC mode (using a random IV) is performed on the principal key using the triple DES key. The entire account structure (containing the encrypted principal key) along with the first 8 bytes of the AccountStructSignature is stored on the configuration sectors of the hard drive. The decrypt process is the reverse of the encrypt process and at the end, the AccountStructSignature is used to verify whether the entire account structure is valid and unmodified. The process of storing a user account on an MU is slightly different due to the fact that the hard drive key cannot be used. In this case, a fixed key is used to encrypt and sign the account structure before storing it on an MU. Also, a fixed IV is used during the 3DES encryption. Neither the fixed key of the fixed IV can ever change due to the fact that user accounts stored on MUs must be able to roam onto different Xboxes using different games. We must assume these fixed keys will be discovered very soon and that whoever has physical possession of an MU can extract the raw user account key if desired. This is why machine account keys are considered more secure than user account keys, since they can never be stored on an MU. A user account alone cannot logon to the Xbox online system; it must be compounded with a valid machine account. Client Side Ticket Caching All Tickets and associated session keys retrieved from either KDC will be cached to the Xbox hard drive. This will make it unnecessary to contact either the AS KDC or the TGS KDC unless the required final tickets to talk to the security gateways have expired. We are doing this because the original machine and user keys used to obtain these tickets are stored on disk anyway, and anybody that could steal the session key associated with an expiring ticket could just as easily steal the original key for the machine or user account. This ticket caching scheme will greatly reduce the amount of traffic to both KDCs as well as decrease the logon latency. This is especially needed since (unlike a PC) people typically reboot their game console many times during a day. As an added security measure, we will be encrypting the ticket session keys before we store the session key on the hard drive. The session key will be encrypted with all the user keys that were used to obtain the corresponding ticket before we store the session key on the hard drive. This guarantees that a ticket cached by a visiting user on an MU will be useless once the MU has been removed. The encryption is done as follows: For every cached ticket we store its 16 byte session key encrypted along with a 20 byte digest of the unencrypted raw session key. We first compute an HMAC of the raw session key using a hard coded fixed key as the HMAC Key:  SessionKeyDigest = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey3, RawSessionKey) This SessionKeyDigest is also stored on the HD to verify the correctness of the raw session key later on. Then the session key is sequentially encrypted using each user s principal key along with the hard drive key. For each encryption, the following steps are performed: First4BytesOf3DESKey = First4BytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey4, EncryptionKey)) Last20BytesOf3DESKey = SHA1-HMAC (FixedKey5, EncryptionKey) EncyptedSessionKey = E3DES (3DESKey, UnencryptedSessionKey) A triple DES key is first generated using 2 separate HMACs on the encryption key and then a triple DES encryption in CBC mode (using a fixed IV) is performed on the session key using the triple DES key. After repeating this step several times (once for each user key and finally once for the hard drive key) the final encrypted session key is computed and stored on the HD along with the ticket and the session key digest. The decrypt process is the reverse of the encrypt process and at the end, the session key digest is used to verify whether the decrypted session key matches the original session key. Whenever, a cache hit is encountered, but the cached ticket already has more than 50% of its lifetime expired, the client tries to obtain a fresh ticket from the KDC. If it fails however, it will continue to use the current cached ticket. We do this to make sure all clients have a semi-fresh ticket that can be used, should a catastrophic failure cause the KDCs to be down. Clock Synchronization Clock synchronization is dealt with in the normal Kerberos fashion. When the time in the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP is off by more than 5 minutes, the KDC reports Kerberos error number 0x25. The client then automatically corrects its UTC time with the supplied correct time in the error message, and retries again. Because the Xbox manages the time zone of the console, the effect the end user will observe is that the Xbox clock is automatically corrected every time the console goes online. We must make sure the clock time of the AS KDC and the TGS KDC as well as the time on the security gateways must all be relatively in sync. Ticket Lifetime The lifetime of the TGTs retrieved from the AS KDC will be set to 30 days. This long time period is justified because these TGTs are only used to obtain real tickets from the Xbox KDC, and that process will check for account lockouts and various other policy issues. Thus the 30 day limit will not permit banned users or machines from gaining unlimited access for 30 days. This longer ticket lifetime will also enable the client ticket cache to more drastically reduce the amount of AS KDC traffic. The lifetime the tickets issued by the Xbox TGS KDC will be a function of the service requested and the game title, but will typically be 36 hours. It was chosen to be 36 hours so that hard core gamers that play everyday will be able to survive an XKDC shutdown for a day without being affected. Ticket Renewal We will not support ticket renewal using the regular Kerberos ticket renewal process. Instead, in the rare case where a ticket has expired, the Xbox will simply request new tickets. The standard Kerberos ticket renewal mechanism is not used. Also the SG currently does not disconnect any secure channels based on the ticket expiration time. In other words, once an Xbox to SG connection is established using a non-expiring ticket, the connection can remain active for however long the user desires irregardless of the expiration time of the ticket. This problem will be corrected in the future. Returning Kerberos Errors Our KDCs have been modified to remain completely silent (no Kerberos Error message is replied) when we receive requests that are known to not come from a legitimate Xbox title. Examples of this include requests for the wrong realm and requests not containing the expected pre-auths. However, due to the possibility that a legitimate Xbox could logon with a user account that has been renamed or has a reset key, we must still respond with KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN and KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED errors when appropriate. Common Pre-Auths Used in All AS Requests The following sections describe custom pre-auths that we have added in all of our AS requests. This includes both the AS request sent to the MACS server as well as the AS requests sent to the AS KDC. Client Version Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_CLIENT_VERSION           132 #define KERB_KDC_REQ_NONCE_SALT            1026 #define KERB_PA_CLIENT_VER_SALT             1027  #defile XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING "Xbox Version=%s Title=0x%X TitleVersion=%d" The Kerberos protocol does not provide a mechanism for the client to report a version number during an AS request. We decided to add a custom client version string as a pre-auth to let the server know the exact version of the client in case we need to make some KDC changes in the future that requires different actions based on the version of the client. The string is formatted using the format string XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING, and the entire null terminated string is encrypted using NonceHMACKey computed as follows: TempKey = MD5-HMAC (PrincipalKey,  signaturekey SaltedNonce = MD5 (KERB_KDC_REQ_NONCE_SALT | NonceInKDCRequest) NonceHMACKey = MD5-HMAC (TempKey, SaltedNonce) EncryptedPreAuth = ERC4-HMAC (NonceHMACKey, FORMATTED_XBOX_CLIENT_VERSION_STRING) The PrincipalKey is the Key of the authenticating principal, which could be either the Online Key, the machine account key, or the user account key depending on what the AS request is for. The NonceInKDCRequest is the 4 byte nonce present in the KDC Request. Mixing the nonce into the key used to encrypt the string, helps avoid the problem of an attacker extracting a pre-auth from one KDC request and attaching it to another. The Pre-Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_PPA                204 #define XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE               20 #define XONLINE_PPA2_STORAGE_LENGTH         8 typedef struct _XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA     FILETIME currentTime;     BYTE ppa1[XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE];     BYTE sppa2atT[XONLINE_PPA_HASH_SIZE]; } XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA, *PXKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA; One major problem we have in our KDC is the fact that when a principal comes to authenticate during an AS request, we need to perform an expensive database lookup to verify the existence of the principal and retrieve the corresponding key of the principal. As such, an attacker can easily launch a denial of service attack on our KDCs by simply sending massive amounts of AS requests for non existing (or existing) principals. Even though the KDC will eventually figure out that the principal does not exist or the client key is incorrect, the massive amount of queries to the database will already bring the entire system to a halt. The obvious solution to this problem is to maintain an in memory list of all the possible principals and it s corresponding key. However, due to the possible long size of principal names and the keys, this would require a lot of memory. Instead we decided to build a hash table that contains fewer bytes per entry, and can be used to verify the client s knowledge of a correct name/key pair without a database lookup. In order to support the use of this smaller sized lookup table, an additional pre-auth (appropriately named the  pre-pre-auth ) was added to each AS request. The details of this pre-pre-auth mechanism is described below. Whenever a new principal entry is added to the system, the following fields are computed:  PPA1 = SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName) SPPA1 = SHA1 (PPA1) PPA2 = First8bytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName | PrincipalName)) Besides storing the Principal Name and Principal Key in the database, we also store SPPA1 and PPA2. The KDC server upon startup reads all the rows for all the principal entries and builds up an in memory hash table containing the following 16 bytes in each entry: The first 4 bytes of SHA1 (PrincipalName) The first 4 bytes of SPPA1 All 8 bytes of PPA2 The first 8 of the above 16 bytes is used as the key to the hash table lookup and the remaining 8 byte PPA2 is used after the look up. If memory is tight, the 8 byte PPA2 data can be omitted. During auth time, the client builds the pre-pre-auth data structure (XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA) and sends it in the clear to the KDC. Inside the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure, the currentTime is filled in with the current time and PPA1 is also computed and filled in. Instead of directly including PPA2, SPPA2@T is computed and included in the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure: SPPA2@T = SHA1 (PPA2 | CurrentTime) The KDC server upon receiving an AS request with this pre-pre-auth, can easily compute SHA1 (PrincipalName) and SPPA1 and perform a hash table lookup to find the corresponding entry. If no such entry is found then the server performs a database lookup to load any new entries that have been added since the last time this query was performed. However, this database lookup is throttled to be called at most once every second, so that denial of service requests can only make us perform a database hit at most once a second. The downside to this is that any account that was just created will need to wait one second before sending out the initial AS request to authenticate. If the hash table entry is found, then PPA2 can be retrieved and SPPA2@T can be computed (using the time included in the pre-auth) and verified to match the value sent in. If the included time in the pre-pre-auth is not within a time skew of the current time, then a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error will need to be returned along with the correct current time. The whole PPA2 step can be omitted if memory is tight and only 8 bytes can be stored per entry. This extra pre-pre-auth enables us to build an in memory hash table that can be used to verify the requester s knowledge of a correct principal name and principal key pair. Once the requester is determined to be a certain principal, a secondary denial of service table can be built to deny requests from this particular principal, if too many requests are being made from that principal.  The Echo Pre-Auth #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_ECHO               205 As an added measure to combat distributed denial of service attacks we also added code into our client to perform the following logic: If a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW or KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED error is returned by the KDC and an extended error info is attached in the Kerberos Error message, then the AS request would be resent again, but this time it would include another echo pre-auth that simply echoes back the bytes received in the extended error info. The purpose of this echo pre-auth is to filter out requests coming from fake IP addresses. We can easily achieve this by attaching a signature blob in the extended error info that somehow embeds the IP address that the incoming request came from. By making the client echo this signature back to us in a subsequent request, we can filter out requests that are coming from bogus IP addresses that were never able to receive the error message containing the extended error info. We currently do not have code in our server to perform this echo request, but we can add that at a later time if the need arises. The important thing is to make sure that all of our released clients are capable of handling this echo request should the need ever arise. MACS Server Exchange Details Important Structures and Constants #define KRB5_PADATA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION   203 #define KERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION_SALT  1203 typedef struct _XKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION     ULONGLONG qwPUID;     CHAR gamertag[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE]; // SN.NNNNNNNNNNNN (serial number)     CHAR domain[XONLINE_USERDOMAIN_SIZE]; // xbox.com     CHAR realm[XONLINE_REALM_NAME_SIZE]; // passport.net     BYTE key[XONLINE_KEY_LENGTH]; // The MD4 hashed key, not the password } XKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION, *PXKERB_PA_XBOX_ACCOUNT_CREATION; Xbox Machine Account Creation Before any online authentication of users can be performed, an Xbox machine account needs to be created in order to bootstrap the Xbox online authentication process. For Xbox machine accounts, we need to make sure that it really is an Xbox attempting to create the account and not a PC pretending to be an Xbox. To prevent arbitrary computers from creating Xbox online accounts, we generate a random  online key  during Xbox manufacturing, and the Xbox serial number along with the online key will function as the pre-shared key between the Xbox and the MACS KDC during machine account creation. We will be using a Kerberos AS request cycle to the MACS KDC Server to perform the machine account creation. Xbox machine account creation is performed as follows: The Xbox does a DNS lookup on  macs.xboxlive.com  and opens a UDP socket to the MACS KDC at port 88. The Xbox sends a KRB_AS_REQ to the Xbox MACS KDC. The principal name used will be  NNNNNNNNNNNN  where the 12 N s are replaced with the 12 digit serial number of the requesting Xbox. The standard PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth will be included, as well as the client version pre-auth and the pre-pre-auth. The online key will be used as the principal key to compute all these pre-auths. The MACS KDC will then perform the pre-pre-auth check and look up the online key for that particular Xbox serial number in the genealogy database. The MACS KDC then checks with the database to determine whether a new machine account needs to be created, whether the machine account already exists and a key reset should be performed, or whether the account is banned due to some policy. If the account is not banned, the online key is retrieved from the genealogy database and an nCipher device is used decode the public key encrypted online key back into its raw form. This raw online key is then used as the principal key to verify the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth. After the KDC verifies that the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP checks out alright, it either creates a new machine account or gathers information about the existing account and resets the machine account key. In either case, the PUID and the new Xbox key will be sent back to the database to record the account reset time and the PUID and key of the new/existing account. The MACS KDC then sends an AS reply back containing the PA-XBOX-ACCOUNT-CREATION pre-auth. This pre-auth is encrypted using the NonceHMACKey similar to the client version pre-auth. The TGT sent back in the reply is totally ignored and the pre-auth in the reply is decrypted to reveal the machine account information. The new machine account information is recorded in the Xbox hard drive, and if all goes well, the MACS KDC will never be contacted by this Xbox again. The key for the krbtgt/macs.xbox.com principal is randomly generated every time a request is made. This is to guarantee that the ticket issued could never be used to do anything. Policies Enforced Only the first request creates a new machine account, the remaining requests only reset the key for the Xbox machine account with that serial number. If any machine has already created an account, then only a key reset will be allowed. If any machine account is blocked or banned, then the MACS request will fail silently. AS KDC Exchange Details The purpose of the AS exchange is to authenticate each machine and user account and to obtain a compound cross realm ticket to krbtgt/xbox.com.  The AS KDC Exchange One AS exchange will occur for each and every user and machine account participating in the logon session. Xbox sends several sequential AS request for all the users attempting to logon to build up a TGT containing the compound identities of all the users. The target for this TGT is the krbtgt at the passport.net realm. All but the very first request will contain a PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth containing the previous TGT (Details of the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY can be found at http://teamsite/kerberos/Hailstorm/Passport%20Kerb.doc). If no users are logging on, this step is omitted. The Xbox sends a final AS request to the AS KDC using the machine account, and includes the TGT obtained in the previous step in the PA-COMPOUND-IDENTITY pre-auth. The target of this request is a cross realm TGT to the  xbox.com  KDC. The returned TGT contains a PAC section with the PUID of the machine account and all the user accounts. The AS requests will be sent sequentially one after another. The PA-PAC-REQUEST-EX pre-auth will be included and the only PAC sections requested will be the PAC_CLIENT_IDENTITY and the PAC_COMPOUND_IDENTITY sections. The standard PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-auth will be included, as well as the client version pre-auth and the pre-pre-auth. Policies Enforced Principal keys must be verified. The PUID of the accounts must be accurately recorded into the PAC section of the returned TGT. Tickets issued will expire in 30 days.

The following steps are carried out: Xbox sends Xbox KDC (located at DNS name  tgs.xboxlive.com ) a TGS request using the combined TGT that contains all the account PUIDs in the PAC section. It requests TKTs to the security gateway for multiple Xbox services. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth section is included in the request to specify the services requested. This pre-auth section is encrypted using NonceHMACKey similar to the client version pre-auth. Also contained in this pre-auth section is the list of user PUIDs currently participating in the logon. The Xbox KDC compares the PUIDs from the PAC section of the incoming TGT with the PUIDs in the pre-auth section, and applies appropriate policy checks. The following are placed into the auth-data section of the issued TKT: The PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth in the same order as they were in the pre-auth. Xbox client specific information contained in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth. The list of services that can be serviced using this TKT. The auth-data is signed using the pre-shared key for the destination SG site by applying an MD5HMAC operation on the XKERB_AD_XBOX portion of the auth data using the SG pre-shared key. The Xbox KDC then returns the ticket for the security gateway site to the Xbox client in the TGS reply. A special PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section is included in the reply to specify which services are serviced at this site, as well as the IP address of the site and the port of each service that is supported. An HR value is returned for each requested service that reports whether the service can be accessed using the returned ticket or whether the service is at another site, or whether the access to the service is not allowed altogether. The Xbox client repeats steps 1 through 5 until it has TKTs to all the sites needed to provide all the requested services. Note that some services may be rejected due to policy checks on the Xbox KDC. The KDC will continue to issue tickets to granted services, even though some requested services are not granted. Policies Enforced The following paragraphs describe the policies that should be enforced by the Xbox TGS KDC when granting out tickets. First some general policies: Tickets granted should only be good for 36 hours, and should NOT be forwardable, proxiable, or renewable. Make sure we return the minimal number of site tickets to satisfy the requested services. When any of the following policies are violated, no ticket is issued and a Kerberos error is possibly returned: Normal Kerberos checks on the PA-TGS-REQUEST pre-auth to test if the session key is correct as well as the timestamp being within the allowed range, is applied. If no service is requested or if the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST pre-auth is not included, the request is silently dropped. The Xbox KDC should make sure all PUIDs in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST are authentic by checking them in the PAC of the TGT. Then the checked PUIDs should be copied into the auth-data of the ticket in the same order they were presented in the pre-auth. If any PUID in the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-REQUEST is missing from the PAC, the request is silently dropped. If the ticket issue date of the incoming TGT is before the last password reset date of any of the user/machine accounts, the entire request must be rejected with Kerberos error KDC_ERR_TGT_REVOKED. This will trigger the client to obtain a fresh TGT and try again. Xbox AP request/reply Details The Xbox client uses the TKTs obtained from the Xbox KDC to construct Kerberos AP-REQ and AP-REP messages that are used to perform mutual authenticate on the key exchange packets sent during setup of the security association between the Xbox and the security gateway. The IP address of the security gateways was obtained from the PA-XBOX-SERVICE-ADDRESS pre-auth section in the TGS reply from the Xbox KDC. The port for each service is used as the inner port sent through the SG tunnel to identify the destination service. The security gateways will retrieve the auth data sealed in the TKTs and forward the auth-data to any backend service that requests it. During the key exchange packets, the controller order of the users as well as information on which user is the guest of another user is also sent from the client to the SG. The SG will use this information to reorder/update the user info in the auth data to reflect the accurate controller order and guest status, so that all backend services can know this information. In order to ensure that the AP request used as part of the SG key exchange packet is not extracted and used within another key exchange packet. We use the  checksum  field within the Kerberos authenticator (contained within the Kerberos AP Request) to store the HMAC digest value of the remaining key exchange initiator packet. Similarly, in the AP reply, we use the  subkey  field to store an HMAC digest value of the remaining key exchange response packet. More details about this key exchange is covered in another document. Policies Enforced Make sure the TKT is valid for the site being hit. Make sure the TKT has not expired. Make sure the time stamp in the authenticator is within the time skew. Make sure the AP-request is not a replay request of a previously seen request with the exact same authenticator timestamp from the Xbox with that exact same PUID. Make sure client is only getting access to services that it was allowed in the auth-data of the TKT. Data Center Key Security The Database in the Xbox Online datacenter will contain numerous keys used for encryption in various server components within our datacenter. These keys include the pre-shared keys with our partners (Billing SPS), Kerberos pre-shared keys with our secure SG sites, as well as millions of machine/user keys we keep to authenticate each machine/user (via Kerberos). All these sensitive keys will exist in a backend database in our datacenter that is behind various firewalls and security gateways. While this datacenter (and database) is secure in nature, attacks will nevertheless still happen. Attacks could range from network penetration into our datacenter, to some security lapse that results in somebody walking away with a tape backup of the DB. To combat this we further secure these keys such that they become even harder to obtain than they otherwise would if they were simply stored in their raw form in the database. Assumptions on Attacks We are making the following assumptions on the difficulty level of attacking various components within our datacenter, starting from the easiest to attack. We assume that if our datacenter is penetrated by an attack, the easiest component the attacker will be able to access is any data on the hard drive of the attacked machine. The next hardest thing the attacker could penetrate is the key database itself. This could be accomplished by either accessing the DB from a machine that was compromised in attack 1, or by simply stealing a tape backup of the DB though some other means. The next hardest thing an attacker could do is execute arbitrary code on a machine within our datacenter. The hardest thing for an attacker to do is obtain a dump of the memory image of a running service on one of our datacenter machines. To the best of my knowledge, there is no way we can avoid the raw forms of the keys existing in memory on the various servers that need them. So this level of attack represents the most lethal attack that, if possible, would almost certainly compromise our raw keys. By using methods described here, we hope to make the level of difficulty of obtaining the sensitive keys in our database roughly equivalent to a level 3 or level 4 attack or performing multiple level 1 and 2 attacks. Overview The way we achieve the added security level for all these sensitive keys, is by encrypting these keys with other keys. Due to the slow nature of public key encryption, we will be handling the encryption process differently depending on whether the key is a frequently used key that is just read once from the DB and cached in memory during the entire server run session (i.e. pre-shared keys), or the key is infrequently accessed and only lives in memory for a short period of time (i.e. user keys). The encryption process will involve using a pair of public/private keys that we will from now on refer to as the  master  public key and the  master  private key. We now describe the encryption process for the two different types of keys. Frequently Used Keys These types of keys are typically pre-shared keys with our secure partners and our security gateway sites that are frequently used and is read once from the DB at service startup time and cached in memory during the entire server run session. There are only a handful of these keys for our entire system. For these keys, we plan to encrypt them all using the master public key and only have the  master public key encrypted  version of these keys exist in the DB. All servers that need to use these keys will at startup time read the encrypted keys from the DB and either directly use the master private key to decrypt the key back to its raw form, or ask some other server that has access to the master private key to decrypt it for them. Infrequently Used Keys These types of keys are typically user keys that are individually accessed very infrequently and are read from the DB only when needed and exists in its raw form in memory only for a very short period of time. Because of the number of keys in this category (think millions of users) and the frequency of which they will need to be decrypted into its raw form, it will be impractical to use public key encryption to encrypt every one of these keys with the master public key and ask the server to perform a private key decryption every time one of them needs to be accessed. In order to solve this problem, we will generate a random 256 bit AES Key (that we will refer to as the Key Encryption Key) that we use to AES encrypt each and every one of the infrequently used keys. The key encryption key itself will be stored and retrieved using the exact same mechanism as the other frequently used keys (i.e. encrypted with the master public key). When a server (e.g. the Kerberos KDCs) that needs access to these infrequently used keys starts up, it will first use the scheme described in section 11.2.1 to bring the key encryption key into its memory. The server can then use the key encryption key to decrypt any of the infrequently used keys when it needs access to the key in its raw form. A random 16 byte IV (salt) will be generated for each and every infrequently used key whenever we AES encrypt the key before storing the encrypted key (along with the IV) into the DB. We will also support key versioning in our DB schema such that the key exchange key as well as the master public/private key can be changed over time without introducing any downtime to our system. Where is the Master Private Key Stored? As you can see from the previous description, the security of the whole system relies on the security of the master private key. So where this key is stored is a critical issue. There are 2 options to consider: The master private key is hand installed on each and every server that needs it and is stored in the machine key set storage space using CryptoAPI routines. Operations will need to keep a separate backup of this key in some other secure location and must be able to hand install this key whenever a new server needs to be added or the key needs to be revised. It makes the difficulty of obtaining the raw keys equivalent to ((having access to the datacenter DB) AND (having access to a server disk image AND figuring out how CryptoAPI stores machine key sets)). Build another Mother of Security Server cluster (a.k.a. the MOSS) that all contain nCipher devices (typically, it will just be two machines for redundancy reasons). The master private key will be stored in the nCipher devices. All servers (and only those servers) that need to perform any master private key decryption will be connected to the MOSS server. The MOSS server will simply perform the task of taking any blob that is sent to it, and decrypting it using the master private key and sending it back to the sender. A baked in fixed key will be used to encrypt the data going in and out of the MOSS server. This makes the master private key never exist on any disk image in any form, but makes it somewhat possible to get access to the frequently used keys if a wire sniffer could ever be placed within our datacenter at the right locations and the backed up key can be obtained. It makes the difficulty of obtaining the raw keys equivalent to ((having access to the datacenter DB) AND (((having network access to the MOSS servers) AND (having source code access)) OR (stealing the nCipher devices and operation cards))). The current plan is to implement option 1 for online launch. Eventually we will migrate to the plan in option 2 when time permits.

Executive summary Each Xbox will have machine specific data that needs to stored on the Xbox during manufacturing. Some of this machine specific data is collected from a database, and some of this data is randomly generated during manufacturing. The Xbox motherboard has an EEPROM on it that we will use to store this machine specific data. This document describes what these machine specific data are, and what code and infrastructure needs to be in place at all Xbox manufacturing facilities for the purpose of generating, writing, and verifying the machine specific data written into the EEPROM. More information about some of the machine specific data can be found in  Xbox-Factory-Key-Generation-Spec.doc Machine Specific Data The following pieces of machine specific data need to be stored in the Xbox EEPROM during manufacturing: Xbox serial number: A 12 byte string that uniquely defines an Xbox. This data comes from the genealogy database. Game region code: A single DWORD specifying what game region this Xbox is for. Current possibilities include: Japan, NTSC world, PAL world. This data comes from the genealogy database. TV region code: A single DWORD specifying what TV output format is used: NTSC, NTSC-J, PAL/I, PAL/M. This data comes from the genealogy database. Ethernet MAC address: A unique 6 byte Ethernet MAC address assigned to each new Xbox. This data comes from the genealogy database. Hard drive key: A randomly generated 16 byte key used to lock the hard drive. Online key: A randomly generated key used during online game play. The following additional data will need to be stored back into the genealogy database after the information is generated for each specific Xbox (see  Xbox-Factory-Key-Generation-Spec.doc  for more details): Hard drive key: 24 bytes ( the 16 byte key base64 encoded) Recover key: 8 bytes Online key version: 4 byte DWORD Online key: 172 bytes (the 16 byte key, RSA encrypted, and base64 encoded) API to Generate, Write and Verify per Box data Each Xbox goes through two different system test phases at the factory. The first is a system integration test phase, where the system is tested after it has been completely assembled. A system integration test PC (separate from the Xbox) communicates with the newly assembled Xbox through the Ethernet port and also communicates with a central genealogy database. At this phase we will be adding code on the PC to collect and generate the data that needs to be sent to the Xbox as well as generate the data that needs to be sent back to the genealogy database to be recorded. The data that is sent to the Xbox is then reorganized and recorded into the Xbox EEPROM in the desired format. Various checksums will also be recorded into the EEPROM and these checksums will be verified in the second extended test phase of the Xbox system level testing. In order to correctly generate, write, and verify the machine specific data, the Xbox software team will deliver 3 software routines to the Xbox system level test software development team (Brad Inman of Intel in particular) to incorporate into the system integration test and extended test phase of the manufacturing process. The following sections describe the API interface to these three routines. GeneratePerBoxData A win32 library (GenPerBoxData.lib) will be created that contains a single function called GeneratePerBoxData. This function will be linked into the software that runs on the system integration test PC during system integration test. HRESULT GeneratePerBoxData (     IN DWORD GameRegion,     IN DWORD AVRegion,     IN LPBYTE pbMACAddress, // 6 bytes     IN LPCHAR pcXboxSerialNumber, // 12 bytes     OUT LPBYTE pbHardDriveKey // 25 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPCHAR pcRecoveryKey // 8 bytes     OUT DWORD* pdwOnlineKeyVersion     OUT LPBYTE pbOnlineKey // 173 bytes with terminating zero     OUT LPBYTE pbOutputBuffer,     IN OUT DWORD* pdwOutputBufferSize,     ); The game region, TV region, the 6 byte Ethernet MAC address, and the Xbox serial number is passed into the routine, and the routine will generate a blob of data that should be transferred to the Xbox and passed into WritePerBoxData so that the data can be written to the correct place on EEPROM. The hard drive key, recovery key, online key version, and online key should be sent back to the genealogy database to be recorded. WritePerBoxData An Xbox XTL library (WritePerBoxData.lib) will be created that contains two functions. One of the functions will be WritePerBoxData. This function will be linked into the software that runs on the Xbox during system integration test. HRESULT WritePerBoxData (     IN LPBYTE pbInputBuffer,     IN DWORD dwInputBufferSize     ); This routine takes the buffer of data generated by GeneratePerBoxData and reformats the information, computes checksums, and writes the result into the EEPROM. VerifyPerBoxData The second routine in the Xbox XTL library (WritePerBoxData.lib) will be VerifyPerBoxData. This function will be linked into the software that runs on the Xbox during the extended test phase. HRESULT VerifyPerBoxData (); This routine reads the data on the EEPROM and verifies that the checksums are valid.

In addition to providing access to the Ethernet NIC and implementing the IP, UDP, and TCP protocols, and the WINSOCK API, it is also concerned with meeting the following goals, for which there is currently no support. An XBox must be able to establish bi-directional communication with a peer XBox, even if one or both of the XBoxes are behind a NAT.  The user should not have to reconfigure his NAT or any other device to make the XBox just work. Network traffic sent and received by an XBox must be authenticated to help prevent denial-of-service attacks, cheating, hacking, buffer-overrun exploits, and generally make the XBox as secure as possible when it is connected to the Internet.  Provide a better gaming experience by managing latency.  This could mean simply measuring ping times between different peers, or between a peer and a server, so we can do better at matching an XBox to the closest or fastest game session or game server.  It might also include us partnering with one or more high-speed backbone providers and work with ISP's to push on-ramp and off-ramp pipes to this backbone closer to our XBox customers.  The rest of this paper briefly describes the previous design and then offers an analysis of its features and problems.  A new design that does not rely on any routing infrastructure is introduced, followed by considerable discussion of how NATs operate and why they are such a problem for peer-to-peer connectivity.  This is followed by a discussion of IPSec and how it can be used meet our security requirements and how it can be made to work in an environment where a NAT may be between an XBox and the Internet.  A discussion of key exchange methods for XBox to server and XBox to XBox is presented next, followed by a description of how LAN play will work.  Some guidelines for memory requirements are discussed, and possible future directions and extensions to the design are contemplated.  The paper ends with a list of dependencies this design has on other groups at Microsoft and a first cut at a possible implementation schedule. XRG: A Bandwidth Collector-Distributor  Before leaving on vacation, I proposed a plan that met all of the goals outlined above.  It envisioned a collection of custom computers called XRG (XBox Router and Gateway).  The idea was that each XBox would be paired at logon time with the closest XRG.  Peer traffic would be tunneled using the custom XTP protocol from your XBox to its XRG, then to the XRG paired to the destination XBox, which would forward it to the ultimate destination.  XBox to server traffic would be tunneled to its XRG, which would then act as a gateway and forward the traffic on to the server, and would send any replies from the server back to the XBox. The XRG plan meets the first goal (work through a NAT) because each XBox would keep an open connection to its XRG.  This connection is bi-directional, so the XRG can send data on the connection to the XBox whenever it wishes.  When a peer XBox wishes to send a packet to another peer, it leverages the fact that it can package up the packet in another packet and address it to its XRG, which can then forward the package along to the peer's XRG, which will then forward the package along to the peer XBox on the one and only open connection. The XRG plan meets the second goal (security) by relying on "transitive authentication".  The idea was that each XBox would establish authenticated communication with its XRG using the XTP protocol.  The XRG would establish authenticated communication with every other XRG and every server (when in gateway mode) using some form of standard IPSec.  Therefore the entire path of packet traversal is authenticated.  The alternative (and more standard) method is end-to-end authentication whereby an XBox negotiates a private session key with each server and peer whenever it begins communication with it. The XRG plan meets the third goal (managing latency) because it presumed that the XRG routers would be pushed close to large population centers (say in an ISP data center for each large city), and that the XRG router would be connected to a super-fast, low latency backbone which would whisk packets across the country more efficiently than if the XBox just took its chances with the Internet. XRG: The Good Parts  The best feature of the XRG design is its simplicity, especially from the perspective of the XBox.  No matter if an XBox is behind a loose NAT, or a strict NAT, or no NAT, the requirement that exactly one persistent connection needs to be maintained means that there is a high likelihood that the solution will work for any type of NAT that is or may be deployed. The "transitive authentication" feature meant that the XBox didn't need to get into the business of implementing any generalize key-exchange protocol.  All that was needed was an XBox to XRG key exchange once at logon time, which could be much lighter-weight than IKE or KINK or any other key exchange standard.  Negotiation of keys would still be necessary between an XRG and another XRG, and between an XRG and a server, but the complexity of that code was not an issue since it wouldn t involve the XBox.  The code running on an XRG or a game server can be upgraded after a title ships.  The code running in an XBox cannot.  The network stack is statically linked as part of a title, so we need to be careful to keep the protocols simple on the XBox side. Finally, by receiving all traffic and routing it through our own routers, we can manage quality of service on behalf of the XBox.  This management would be dynamic since after a title ships we are free to deploy XRG boxes in different locations around the world, and strike deals with more and more ISP's and backbone providers to continually improve quality of service connections. XRG: The Bad Parts  The most common criticism of the XRG design was that "you don't want to be in the business of deploying those boxes".  The deployment of XRG routers around the world is by definition scattered (in order to be close to large populations of XBoxes).  This means that we would need to deploy hardware in many different locations, certainly more than say one or two large data centers.  The configuring and maintenance of the XRG routers would quickly become an operations nightmare, and the fact that the routers are physically scattered just makes it that much worse. The second criticism is that "you don't want to build these boxes yourself".  The argument is that the proposed design is really just a virtual private network (VPN) overlaid on the Internet, and there are standard VPN concentrator boxes that you can buy from Cisco and other network manufacturers that will solve your problem.  Whenever we drill down on this point, however, there is a set of issues that makes using off-the-shelf VPN concentrators not as straightforward as it sounds.  These include detecting that an XBox has been "turned off" for our persistence mechanism, and the fact that large numbers of globally routable IP addresses would need to be acquired so that each XBox that is online will have a real IP address.  For these and other reasons, it was feared that any standard VPN concentrator usage would not provide one or more key pieces we need to make our online service work, and so we would probably still need to deploy custom servers that sit next to each VPN concentrator to make up for it, which is worse than going with only XRG routers in my opinion. Yet another criticism of the XRG design is that it forces all network traffic to and from every XBox to be routed through our XRG infrastructure.  This means that we are on the hook for all costs associated with bandwidth ingress and egress through our routers.  Even if two XBoxes were behind the same NAT in the same house, all traffic would still travel up to an XRG and then back down to the peer.  That's a lot of traffic to handle and that's a lot of traffic to pay for.  This alone would probably make the XBox Online Service unprofitable, and that would be bad. Welcome Back: Try Again  So I return from vacation fat and happy (well, maybe just a little heavier than before), and I'm given the news.  They ran the numbers for cost of bandwidth and it just won't work.  Not all traffic can flow through our routers. We discussed ways of tweaking the XRG strategy.  One plan involved allowing content download to be special-cased because such content is not latency-sensitive and, more importantly, is often very large (many megabytes).  The idea was that content download would be used to download encrypted and signed packages onto the hard disk, therefore the connection to the server really doesn't need to be authenticated.  So forget about IPSec level of security for this case ... no need to worry about key-exchange, just speak raw HTTP directly to a server through the NAT.  I personally don't like the idea of weakening security here because it means we've opened a hole in our security story.  We would need to make sure that the IP layer, TCP layer, HTTP layer, and all the download utilities were and always will be bulletproof.  That is, there is no way to exploit a buffer-overrun or other error in any of that code.  Given all the trouble we are going through to implement strong IPSec level security, I think it is a mistake to open up a potential attack point like this.   A compelling counter argument to my objection is that for cost reasons, it may be desirable to pay one or more content-hosting companies to host some of our XBox content.  These companies already have web servers scattered across the globe with fat bandwidth pipes connected to them, and by letting them dole out our 50MB signed and encrypted packages, we get efficient content distribution without having to worry about bandwidth spikes in our own data centers.  Because the packages are signed and encrypted, the XBox only needs to connect to our data center to obtain the key to open the package, and that can be done using authenticated and secure communication. Another counter argument to my objection that all packets received by the HTTP, TCP, and UDP layers are authenticated is that the initial account setup, the communication with the Passport KDC, and the communication with our own KDC will all need to be done without any IPSec authentication since this is the bootstrapping mechanism for establishing accounts and acquiring tickets which is used as input to session key exchange.  Whatever network layers these mechanisms use (and HTTP is proposed for at least one of them), we will need to make sure that there are no exploitable security flaws in them.  Once you accept this argument, it is only a small step to saying that the encrypted package download code (a set of small utilities built on top of HTTP) should likewise be bulletproof (and written by the XBox team only and not the title developer) so that we allow downloads of content to the hard disk via an unauthenticated connection directly from the XBox to a web server. Allowing an XBox to communicate directly with a web server in some limited cases reduces our bandwidth costs, but what about communication between an XBox and a game server or between an XBox and a peer XBox?  One suggestion was to allow some of these connections to bypass the XRG infrastructure by communicating directly using standard Internet routing.  This has the advantage that the XBox Online Service does not pay for any peer-to-peer bandwidth, and only traffic flowing to a game server is subject to egress costs, but that would be the same even if the traffic were routed through an XRG before arriving at the game server. If you assume that all peer-to-peer and XBox to server traffic can bypass the XRG infrastructure, then there really is no need for the XRG infrastructure at all.  In fact, if the XRG is not routing any traffic, then it is simply a server whose sole purpose is to allow an XBox to keep a NAT port assignment alive by receiving and ACKing periodic pings. But if we don t have any custom routing or alternative backbone paths, then all traffic to and from an XBox is subject to whatever peering schemes the various ISP s have set up.  Some ISP may go through a congested peering point to connect to another ISP hosting an XBox peer.  There will be nothing we can do to remedy or improve the situation because the XBox Online Service does not monitor or even see the traffic between peers.  If two peers experience unusually long latencies, there is nothing we can do to make it any better, nor, more importantly, is there a lot we can do to allow our Matchmaking service to predict what the latency between these two peers might be when trying to set up a satisfying online gaming session.  About the only information Matchmaking will have is the IP addresses of each XBox peer.  It would have to map those addresses to ISP s, know about peering points in the Internet, and make educated guesses about what sort of latency the peers might expect if it were to match them up. If you are willing to give up on managing latency, at least for the first year online titles, then there is a design that minimizes our bandwidth costs while still providing connectivity through NAT devices and IPSec level security.  My opinion is that quality of service (QoS) on the Internet today is still very much in the research stage.  Managing latency is just another name for QoS, so it probably makes sense to let the Internet researchers take a crack at figuring it out first.  In the future with IPv6 or QoS painting of packets that are understood by the Internet routing infrastructure, the costs will probably be much less than attempting to overlay our own routing on the current Internet.  We are designing and implementing for today, and in today's Internet QoS is still in the "wouldn't it be neat" category.  Latency:  Just Do Your Best  So I went back to the drawing board, but this time I threw out the third goal (managing latency).  Let's assume that we will make no attempt to control how a packet makes it from one XBox to another.  "You sends your packets, you takes your chances."  I believe the first two goals are in the "must do" category.  We must provide a solution for an XBox behind a NAT because that's what exists today in lots of homes.  And we must provide security because the first person to crack little Billy's XBox while it is sitting on the Internet and manages to load some porn on it will get lots of free air-time on CNN, and that sort of notoriety is a huge incentive for many hackers out there. So lets take the two remaining goals one at a time.  The first goal, work through all NATs, implies that every XBox must be maintaining an open connection to some server.  If it doesn't maintain this connection, then the XBox has no Internet presence at all.  Only when the XBox initiates an outgoing connection does the NAT assign an IP address (usually its own) and a port (usually different than the source port the XBox specified).  This combination of NAT IP address and NAT port can be thought of as the XBox external IP address and external port.  Inside the NAT, the XBox also has a local IP address and local port. From here on out we are going to be talking about IP addresses and ports a lot, so lets define some terminology that will make this discussion as precise as possible.  When talking about an XBox, we will give it a name such as XB1 or XB2.  When talking about a game server, we will use a name such as GS1 or GS2.  When talking about a connection server (described below), we will use a name such as CS1 or CS2.  We assume that an XBox may be behind a NAT or may be in the clear (that is, there is no NAT and the XBox has a global IP address typically acquired from a DHCP server during startup).  We always assume that a GS, CS, or any server in general is not behind a NAT. For reasons we will explain shortly, you can assume that all traffic to and from an XBox or a game server or a connection server is in the form of a UDP packet whose source port is set to 501 and whose destination port is also set to 501.  That is, no matter what sort of UDP, TCP, HTTP or other protocol packet the XBox is trying to send or receive, it will place this packet inside a UDP packet and send it to a destination IP address with the source port set to 501 and the destination port set to 501.  Of course, if there is a NAT in the way between an XBox and a GS (for example), when the GS receives the UDP packet on port 501, the source port part of the UDP header will most likely not be 501 any more.  It will be some other port assigned by the NAT.  In all cases, the receiver of any UDP packet on port 501 must take note of the potentially remapped source port and use it as the destination port for any replies.  The source port for all replies will be 501.  Note that when the XBox behind the NAT receives this reply, it will see the destination port as 501 and not the remapped port because the NAT has undone the port mapping for return traffic. An XBox behind a NAT when it maintains an outgoing connection will have a local IP address and local port (always 501) as well as a NAT IP address and NAT port.  If we want to talk about the local addresses of an XBox, we will use XB1.LIP and XB1.LP.  If we want to talk about the NAT addresses of an XBox, we will use XB1.NIP and XB1.NP.  Sometimes we want to just talk about the external IP address and external port of an XBox.  By this we mean that IP address that a computer directly connected to the Internet (not going through a NAT) would be able to address a packet to the XBox.  For an XBox directly connected to the Internet, we mean the XB1.LIP and XB1.LP.  For an XBox that is going through a NAT, we mean the XB1.NIP and XB1.NP.  To simplify matters, when we talk about an external IP address and external port of an XBox, we will use XB1.XIP and XB1.XP.  That way we don t have to constantly say things like  if behind a NAT we mean the NIP, but if not behind a NAT we mean the LIP .  We will simply say  the XIP and XP of the XBox A CS, GS, or any server will never be behind a NAT, so there is no local versus external addressing potential confusion.  When talking about the IP address and port of a server, we will use CS1.IP and CS1.P. Connection Servers In order for an XBox that is behind a NAT to have an external IP address and external port, the XBox must initiate and maintain an open connection to some server.  Let us call these servers  Connection Servers  or CS for short.  The purpose of a CS is to receive periodic packets from an XBox and acknowledge them.  Exactly how an XBox figures out which CS to connect to is a similar problem to figuring out which XRG to connect to in the earlier plan, except that this time we don t care about  nearness  in the latency sense.  Any CS with available resources will do just fine.  We are more concerned with keeping the NAT port mapping alive than getting a quick response from the CS. It should be obvious that the CS will also be the one that detects and reports to the presence system whenever an XBox has disappeared so that buddy-lists can be updated, for example.  The presence system will keep a lookout for a CS going down so it can deduce that all XBoxes that were connected to it are now offline. Once an XBox finds a CS with available resources to handle an additional connection, it will logon to that server and the characteristics of the connection will be probed.  Unfortunately, not all NAT implementations behave the same way.  The XRG design was quite resilient to implementation details of the NAT.  All it cared was that a bi-directional connection could be maintained between the XBox and its XRG.  Once that connection was formed, there would be no further attempts to form a connection between the XBox and any other server (except for the occasional outgoing connection to Passport and a couple of KDC computers).  Certainly no incoming connections would ever be attempted to the XBox.  All such traffic would be routed through the one connection between the XBox and the XRG. NAT:  How Does It Work? The purpose of a NAT is share a limited set of external IP addresses (usually just one) with a set of computers that are inside the NAT.  One type of NAT obtains a pool of external IP addresses and sets up a mapping between an available external IP address and the local IP address of a computer when it makes an outgoing connection to some server.  It then monitors the connection to figure out when the connection is no longer necessary (usually by inactivity timeouts for UDP connections, or by watching for TCP FIN packets for TCP connections).  The external IP address is then put back in the pool for use by another local computer. I believe that a NAT that has multiple external IP addresses is unlikely to be found inside a home environment.  This is because a NAT is often added in the home precisely because there is a shortage of external IP addresses.  Typically an ISP will assign only one IP address to a home, and the user can either assign it directly to a PC, or if there is more than one PC, he can buy a NAT to share the same IP address with more than one computer.  Often the NAT hardware is embedded in the Cable Modem or DSL Modem in the user s home. On the other hand, there is a possibility that an ISP for any number of reasons has installed a NAT at the ISP data center on behalf of all of its users.  It could do this because it did not have enough external IP addresses to hand out to each of its users.  Perhaps the paperwork for acquiring enough class B or class C addresses didn t get filed on time. In any case, it is typically the case that the number of available external IP addresses that the NAT has in its pool is smaller than the number of local computers wishing to communicate through the NAT at any given time.  This means that a NAT operating as described above (maps one local address to one external address) will run out of external addresses and will have to deny access to the Internet to one or more local computers until one of the computers is  finished  with it.  For the NAT that has just one external IP address, this means that computers inside the NAT would serialize access to the NAT on a per-connection basis.  That would be annoying, which is why port mapping is done. A NAT that implements port mapping is sometimes referred to as a NAPT (Net Address and Port Translator).  Such a NAT multiplexes access to its limited pool of external IP addresses by translating not only the local IP address to an external IP address, but also by translating a local port to an external port.  Interestingly, an IP packet does not have a concept of a port.  This concept is found in the UDP protocol and the TCP protocol, but not in many other protocols.  Fortunately, these two protocols account for the large majority of traffic a NAT is likely to encounter.  Let s ignore what the NAT does for protocols that are not UDP or TCP since the XBox will not be sending any other protocol across a NAT device. When a NAT receives a UDP or TCP packet from a local computer, it consults a mapping table to determine if it has already established a mapping for [LIP LP].  If so, it changes the source address of the IP packet from LIP to NIP and it changes the source port in the UDP or TCP header of the packet from LP to NP.  If it does not have an entry in its mapping table, it tries to find an unused [NIP NP] pair to assign to this new [LIP LP] connection.  For each external IP address that the NAT can use, there are 64K available ports because the UDP and TCP source port field is 16-bits.  That means that the total number of mappings the NAT can maintain is N x 64K where N is the number of external IP addresses it has in its pool (and often just one).  So to allocate a [NIP NP] pair, the NAT just needs to know which of the 64K ports are in use in each of its external IP addresses.  It finds the first one that isn t used, marks it in use, and adds [LIP LP] ( [NIP NP] to its mapping table. When a packet is received by a NAT from the Internet, it needs to figure out which of the local computers should receive the packet.  It does this by maintaining a reverse mapping table that simply maps [NIP NP] ( [LIP LP].  If it finds an entry in the reverse mapping table, it changes the destination address from NIP to LIP and the destination port from NP to LP.  If there is no such entry in the mapping table, the NAT drops the packet and it is lost.  Actually, there are exceptions to this case.  Some NATs will allow an owner to manually configure a port mapping. Consider the case where I have a web server inside my NAT that I want to make accessible to the Internet.  If I can tell my NAT to always send TCP port 80 incoming packets to the local IP address of the web server, then everything would work just fine.  But it would not be possible to have more than one web server inside the NAT that has just one external IP address because there is only one [NIP 80] ( [LIP 80] mapping available for each external IP address.  In general, there can be N web servers inside a NAT that has N external IP addresses. A mapping is maintained by the NAT until it is not longer needed.  Because a NAT is transparent to the computers on either side, there is no communication directly with the NAT to let it know that the mapping for a connection can be freed.  Different NATs use different heuristics to determine when it can free a mapping.  These range from scanning the TCP packets looking for the FIN or RST segment to just keeping the connection open for a certain amount of time after the last packet was sent or received on the connection.  The amount of time the NAT allows before reclaiming the mapping is not discoverable but is thought to be anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes.  It is also undiscoverable what the policy is for maintaining a mapping for UDP connections.  A NAT may keep a mapping alive for a UDP connection if only outgoing packets are seen and there is never a response.  A different NAT might reclaim the mapping if there has not been any return traffic in a certain amount of time. NAT: Variations On A Theme The algorithms and heuristics described above are sufficient for a NAT to do its job efficiently and effectively.  Unfortunately, many NAT implementers have lost sight of what problem they were supposed to solve and decided that they could add value by adding rudimentary firewall protections.  It is these additions that will cause us no end to grief because many of them are undiscoverable and others are only somewhat discoverable.  For some NATs there will be no way to establish peer-to-peer communication between an XBox behind one and an XBox behind another unless we have a third party router (such as an XRG).  The hope is that these kinds of NAT either don t exist, or are very rare in the homes or ISPs of XBox users. The algorithm a NAT uses can be characterized by its port assignment policy, its filtering policy, and its session policy.  We ll explore each of these individually. A NAT must assign an unused [NIP NP] address whenever it processes an outbound packet with a unique [LIP LP] address for which is has no mapping (the proof is left as an exercise for the reader).  And this mapping must remain constant for as long as the packet flow with [LIP LP] as the source address continues.  However, in the most general case, a NAT can decide to allocate a unique [NIP NP] address for each unique [LIP LP DIP DP] tuple it detects in an outbound packet, where DIP is the destination IP address and DP is the destination port.  A less general case would be for the NAT to assign a unique [NIP NP] address for each [LIP LP DIP] or [LIP LP DP] tuple it detects, though the utility of the latter tuple is dubious.  A NAT that allocates a unique port mapping based on the DIP or DP of an outgoing packet is said to have an aggressive port assignment policy.  A NAT that reuses the same port mapping for each [LIP LP] address regardless of the DIP or DP is said to have a minimal port assignment policy.   A NAT with a minimal port assignment policy has the feature that port assignment is predictable.  Once a CS determines the [NIP NP] address of an XBox, the XBox behind a NAT with minimal port assignment knows that an outbound packet from the same [LIP LP] will be assigned the same [NIP NP] that was assigned at the time the session to the CS was established, regardless of which [DIP DP] the packet is addressed to.  A CS can discover the port assignment policy of a NAT in front of an XBox by having the XBox send a packet from the same [LIP LP] address to some other CS (or to a different IP address on the same CS) and seeing if the NAT assigned the same [NIP NP] address.  It is possible, though we hope unlikely, that there are NAT implementations that use a minimal port assignment policy, but then change at some point and start using a more aggressive port assignment policy.  One can envision, perhaps, that a given port assignment has been used for  too many  [DIP DP] addresses (because the NAT is memorizing these destinations in its port mapping tables), and the NAT at some point allocates another port assignment the next time a unique [LIP LP DIP DP] tuple is detected because the  record  associated with the existing port assignment is full.  A NAT that exhibits this behavior would be problematic because our discovery mechanism would be fooled into believing that the NAT uses minimal port assignment when actually it sometimes does not and should really be thought of as having an aggressive port assignment policy. When a packet that is inbound from the Internet arrives at a NAT, the destination address and destination port should match one of the active [NIP NP] port assignments being maintained in the mapping table.  If it does not, then the packet is dropped because there is no way for the NAT to know which local computer the packet should be forwarded to.  If the mapping is found, then the destination address is changed to the mapped LIP and the destination port is changed to the mapped LP and the packet is forwarded.  A NAT that exhibits this behavior is said to have a loose filtering policy.  For misguided security reasons, however, a NAT can be designed to filter inbound packets.  In the most restrictive case, the NAT could remember every unique destination address (DIP) and destination port (DP) that an outbound packet referenced (by tagging the [LIP LP] ( [NIP NP] mapping entry with one or more [DIP DP] addresses).  Then for every inbound packet which is addressed to [NIP NP], the NAT will only forward the packet if it has a source address and source port which match one of the saved [DIP DP] addresses for that mapping entry.  This enforces the policy that a response to an outgoing packet must come back from exactly the same host and port that was mentioned in the outgoing packet.  A response from a different port on the destination host would be rejected, as would a response that comes from a different host.  An equally misguided but less restrictive NAT might remember only the DIP as part of the mapping entry, and would therefore enforce the policy that a response to an outgoing packet must come back from the same host, but it will allow the host to respond from any port, not just the one that the outgoing packet was addressed to.  A misguided and confused NAT might even remember only the DP as part of the mapping entry.  This would allow any host to respond as long as it did so from the port that the outgoing packet was addressed to.  A NAT that filters inbound packets based solely on the DIP but not the DP is said to have an address-sensitive filtering policy.  A NAT that filters inbound packets based on the DP regardless of whether it also filters based on the DIP is said to have a port-sensitive filtering policy. A CS can discover the filtering policy of a NAT in front of an XBox during the initial logon sequence as follows.  After the connection has been established to the CS on [CIS.IP CIS.P], the CS will send a packet to the XBox from a port other than the one the XBox used to establish communication.  If after several attempts the XBox never receives the packet, we conclude that the NAT has a port-sensitive filtering policy.  If the XBox does receive the packet, we go to the next part of discovery and have the CS send a packet from a different IP address and different port to the XBox.  If after several attempts the XBox does not receive the packet, we conclude that the NAT has an address-sensitive filtering policy.  If it receives packets from both of the tests, we conclude that the NAT has a loose filtering policy.  Note that this test assumes that no computer or XBox behind the NAT has recently sent a packet to the addresses on the CS where these tests originate.  We include any computer here because it is presumed that the local addresses behind a NAT are dynamically assigned when the computer or XBox boots.  It is possible, though unlikely, that a computer boots, gets address 10.0.0.1 from the NAT and sends a packet to the IP address and port of the CS that will be used for filtering policy discovery.  Then the computer releases address 10.0.0.1, reboots, and the XBox boots and acquires 10.0.0.1.  At this point if the NAT didn t remove all the mappings to 10.0.0.1 then this test will be fooled into thinking that the NAT has a looser filtering policy than it actually does because the test packets will make it through the NAT, when in reality the NAT is address-sensitive and/or port-sensitive. The final characteristic of a NAT is its session policy.  For TCP traffic, a NAT might watch the incoming and outgoing packets looking for the signal from either side that the connection has terminated (by looking for a FIN or RST segment).  However, for UDP traffic there is no reliable indication that the  connection  is finished (i.e. that the sender and receiver are finished sending packets to each other on the [LIP LP] ( [NIP NP] mapping).  Even for TCP traffic, if each side reboots then neither will send a FIN or RST to the other and the NAT will not be able to determine when the session has ended.  What this means is that a NAT must implement a heuristic whereby it assumes that sufficient inactivity across a given port mapping means that the connection is no longer active and the mapping may be reclaimed.  The obvious question is what is the timeout period?  Unfortunately, this is undiscoverable unless you don t mind performing a test that could take anywhere from a minute to a half hour to run.  The best we are going to do is to assume a timeout that is at least as short as the most restrictive NAT we encounter.  I doubt we want to add a configuration setting in the XBox for the user to adjust this timeout value, but that is another way to go (maybe hidden deep down in the advanced section of the DASH). In order for the XBox to maintain an active connection to the CS and prevent the NAT from reclaiming the port mapping it established between the XBox and the CS, the XBox will have to send periodic packets to the CS.  The interval will need to be shorter than the inactivity timeout of the NAT.  But an open question is whether the CS has to send a response to the XBox.  It is an open question whether a NAT considers unidirectional traffic sufficient to keep a port mapping alive.  In the case of communication between an XBox and the CS this is not a serious since there are other reasons that the CS must acknowledge the periodic packets the XBox sends (not least of which is so that the XBox can know that the CS hasn t rebooted and thus terminated the connection). Session policy gets interesting when you take into consideration the port assignment policy and the filtering policy of a NAT.  If a NAT has a minimal port assignment policy and a loose filtering policy, we should be able to assume that the periodic packets sent to the CS is enough to keep the NAT from reclaiming the single port assignment that is used for all XBox to peer and XBox to server communication.   But a NAT that has a minimal port assignment policy and an address-sensitive filtering policy might require that unidirectional or bi-directional traffic occur between the [LIP LP] ( [NIP NP] ( [DIP] mapping regularly (i.e. ping every destination regularly).  Otherwise the NAT would remove [DIP] from the  allowable destinations  list, and if that list were to become empty, it would remove the mapping entirely.  Because each XBox maintains a bi-directional connection to a CS, the list will never become empty so we don t have to worry about the [NIP NP] mapping getting reclaimed, but the NAT might still require regular traffic to each destination.  Failure to handle this scenario would mean that an XBox to XBox connection might mysteriously stop working even though both peers are still active and still have active CS connections.  It is my guess that a NAT with minimal port assignment and address-sensitive filtering will require keep-alive traffic to each destination.  If it did not, then its list of  allowable destinations  for each port mapping would continue to grow so long as any traffic to any of the destinations is maintained.  In our case we will be maintaining a connection to CS, which means that if the NAT did not timeout its allowable destinations list, the list would soon contain the union of all hosts the XBox has communicated with, which would defeat the firewall feature the NAT was trying to emulate by filtering.  And it would consume potentially unbounded amount of resources in the NAT for connections that are no longer in use. A NAT that has an aggressive port assignment policy by definition allocates a different [NIP NP] for each destination (or at least it is free to), and so we assume that the XBox will need to send regular traffic to each peer or server that is communicating with to prevent the NAT from reclaiming the port mapping.  This requirement is the same regardless of the whether the NAT has a loose, address-sensitive, or port-sensitive filtering policy. NAT: Opening A NAT Hole From the above discussion, we see that a NAT has a port assignment policy (for which there are two variations), a filtering policy (for which there are three variations), and a session policy (which mainly consists of an undiscoverable timeout quantity and a ping-strategy which is sensitive to the port assignment and filtering policies).  That gives us six types of NAT, plus if we add the  no NAT  case, we have a total of seven NAT types that might sit between the XBox and the Internet. No NAT, no port assignment and no filtering. Minimal port assignment and loose filtering. Minimal port assignment and address-sensitive filtering. Minimal port assignment and port-sensitive filtering. Aggressive port assignment and loose filtering. Aggressive port assignment and address-sensitive filtering. Aggressive port assignment and port-sensitive filtering. If we assume that there is no custom XRG routing infrastructure that can route and gateway packets, then we are left with making sure that an XBox behind each of these NAT types is capable of establishing bi-directional communication to and from UDP port 501 to any server on the Internet (a server is never behind a NAT) and to any XBox peer (the other XBox may be behind a NAT).  This gives us a matrix of 49 possibilities for XBox to XBox communication.  For each cell in the matrix, we need to specify an algorithm that will force the NAT to allow the UDP 501 traffic to flow.  Note that the XBox to server case is the same as XBox to XBox case when the target XBox is not behind a NAT, so the   column in the matrix specifies the algorithm for the XBox to server case as well.

Pinging required. For all those cells that contain an  , this means that either there is no way to establish direct communication between two XBoxes which are behind the NAT types indicated.  (In fact, some of them are possible but very convoluted, so I won t bother describing the algorithms here.)  Take for example the  From 7 To 7  case.  This is the case where a NAT is both aggressively assigning new ports while simultaneously port filtering inbound traffic.  This means that a NAT1 will create a new port mapping when XB1 sends to XB2.  But that packet will not get through NAT2 because it is port filtering (which implies address filtering as well), so the packet that contains the new port is lost.  There is no simple way to discover it because if XB1 attempts to send a packet somewhere else (like to a CS), the aggressive port mapping NAT will just assign a different port and remember that only the CS can reply on that port assignment, which does XB2 no good. There is a chance that two XBoxes could be behind the same NAT.  In that case, however, the NIP of each of the peers should be the same, and the peers will establish connectivity directly as if there were no NAT in the way.  In the case of a NAT with more than one external IP address in its pool, it is possible that two XBoxes that are behind the same NAT do not share the same NIP address.  The solution here involves trying the local addresses first just in case they are, or some other heuristic based on subnet masks.  We ll figure something out if we ever come upon this case in practice. Finally, there is always the possibility that there is more than one NAT in the way between an XBox and the Internet.  The most common scenario would be a home user who installs a NAT and has an ISP that also installed a NAT on behalf of all of its customers.  I thought about working through the algorithms above to figure out the implications, but my head started to hurt so I stopped.  Suffice it to say that peer-to-peer connectivity might suffer further in such a scenario. NAT and CS:  Connectivity Coconspirators  We can now put together everything we ve learned about NATs and CS to explain how an XBox is able to establish bi-directional communication with a server or peer XBox, at least most of the time. The XBox finds a CS somehow (algorithm TBD, but using DNS for  xboxcs.xbox.com  would work just fine), and initiates a logon to CS.  During the logon sequence, the CS and XBox send and receive UDP packets on different ports and from different addresses to discover the policies of the NAT that is in between the XBox and the CS, if any.  When the logon sequence is complete, the CS and XBox will each know the following:  The [LIP 501] (local address of the XBox at fixed port 501), the [NIP NP] (the port assignment that the NAT translated [LIP 501] into, at least for the connection between the XBox and the CS), the [CS.IP 501] (the address of the connection server at fixed port 501), and the type of NAT (one of the seven types, including  In order to establish connectivity between any two peers in a world of NATs and CS, the concept of  IP address  is not as simple as a four-byte quantity any more.  For our purposes, the  complete address  of a peer is {[LIP 501] [NIP NP] [CS.IP 501] NATTYPE}.  Which is a 16-byte quantity if you squeeze out the fixed 501 ports and use two bytes for NATTYPE. It should be clear that 16-byte addresses are unmanageable to higher networking layers.  They can t be given to DPLAY or WINSOCK, which require four-byte IP addresses.  We solve this problem by exposing a custom XNetRegisterPeerAddress API that takes the 16-byte complete address of a peer and returns a private IP address (something like 0.0.0.1).  This address only makes sense to the local XBox and must not be sent to any other server or peer since it will not have meaning outside the local XBox.  On the other hand, peers are free to exchange their own 16-byte complete addresses, which is exactly what a peer needs to do before another peer can have any hope of establishing communication. When the IP layer of the XBox network stack comes across an private IP address that we handed out via XNetRegisterPeerAddress, it will first need to make sure that connectivity has been established with the peer.  If it has not, then one of the algorithms described earlier for opening a hole to the peer must be used.  All the information necessary to run the algorithms is available because the higher layers have registered the 16-byte complete address of the peer and the network stack knows the 16-byte complete address of the local XBox.  A few UDP packets go flying back and forth and just like magic connectivity has been established.  Once this is done, the original packet is modified by inserting a UDP header with source port 501 and destination port set to the external port of the peer (either 501 for the no NAT case, or the port assigned by the NAT), and changing the destination address in the IP header from the private IP address to the external IP address of the peer (either its local IP address for the no NAT case, or the NAT address).  The rest of the packet becomes the payload of the new UDP packet, and the protocol field of the IP header is changed to UDP.  (Don t worry at this point about where the original protocol gets stashed.  We ll describe the real UDP packet framing later when we introduce security). When the XBox receives a UDP packet from a peer on port 501, it can use the source address and source port to figure out the private IP address it has assigned to this peer earlier.  It then removes the UDP header from the packet, changes the source address to be the private IP address for this peer and sends the packet along to the higher network layers.  (Again, this isn t the real framing we will use, but is getting closer.  Keep reading.) The one key point to keep in mind is that all packet types, no matter what protocol or source port or destination port (for UDP/TCP) the packet specifies, will be transmitted to the peer or server by encapsulation in a UDP packet on well-known port 501.  The reason for this is because we have gone through a lot of trouble to establish connectivity between two peers on exactly one port.  The packet must be transformed into a UDP packet because the NAT must have a port to translate or else it won t know what to do with the packet.  This encapsulation format is known by all of the endpoints in our world, and encapsulation and decapsulation happen at the IP layer.  Higher network layers will not see the effects of the packet transformations we ve performed. Adding Security To The Mix  At this point we have met the requirements of the first goal, establish connectivity through a NAT -- at least for every case we are likely to see in widespread use (we hope).  Since we punted on the latency goal, this just leaves security. Using some form of IPSec security (either AH or ESP) would satisfy the goal, but unfortunately having a NAT in the way once again causes problems.  Any attempt to use IPSec Authentication Header (AH) would fail because the NAT modifies portions of the IP header which are protected by the hash stored in the AH header.  The receiver of such a packet would have to reject it because the hash would not match because it appeared that someone modified the packet, which just so happens to be the NAT. If we use IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) then we don t have issues with the NAT changing fields that the authenticating hash is sensitive to, so packets that reach the target computer would appear authentic.  Unfortunately, the framing format for an IP packet that has been converted into an IPSec ESP packet looks like [IP][ESP][Payload][ESPTAIL].  This is problematic because there is no UDP or TCP header following the IP header, and it is the fact that UDP and TCP headers have a port number in them that allows the NAT to perform the translation we described earlier.  If a NAT received a packet in standard ESP format, it would have to drop it and that of course would defeat our connectivity story. So that takes us back to doing something non-standard for authentication.  In order to work through a NAT, all packets must be UDP packets that receive their data on port 501.  The previous section showed how all types of packets can be multiplexed onto a single port by encapsulating the original packet in a UDP packet.  We can be extended this further by applying ESP framing to the payload of the original packet after UDP framing is complete.  The format of our packets will look like [IP][UDP][ESP][Payload][ESPTAIL].  This is almost the same as what a normal ESP packet would look like, except that we ve inserted a UDP header between the IP header and the ESP header.   This framing specification also allows us to answer the question of where does the protocol number for the original packet get stored.  Recall that the original packet could have been, say, a TCP packet.  By changing it into a UDP packet so that it can get through the NAT, we ve lost the indicator that the original packet was a TCP packet.  This protocol indicator needs to be transported in the packet somewhere so that the decapsulation code on the other side will have enough data to reconstruct the original packet after it passes the authentication checks.  The answer is that the [ESPTAIL] structure contains a field called  Next Header  which is meant to store the protocol of the original payload. The overhead introduced by UDP and ESP framing is a minimum of 32 bytes and a maximum of 35 bytes.  The reason for the range of values is that the [ESPTAIL] portion of the packet has alignment requirements, so up to three pad bytes might have to be inserted before it in the worst case.  The XTP protocol proposed for packet framing in the XRG design would have introduced 36 bytes of overhead.  The reason it is larger is because it contains an additional pair of private addresses to support tunneling through our routing system.  In any case, the two formats have very similar overhead profiles so it makes sense to go with the more standard IPSec ESP framing rather than trying to invent another. Multiplexing On A Single Port Now that we know about the wire format of our packets, we next have to deal with the issue of control versus data on our single incoming port.  Recall that we require all incoming traffic to arrive in UDP format on a single well-known port 501.  When data is flowing between two computers, both sides will have set up security associations and exchanged keys used to hash the payload of the packet and stamp it.  But what sort of packets did the sides send to each other to establish the keys that will be used to authenticate the packets?  You can t construct valid ESP packets without knowing the key, and you can t know the key without exchanging some packets. In the paper  IPSec Over NAT Using UDP Encapsulation , William Dixon outlines several potential solutions to this problem.  I would like to propose an alternative solution that I believe is the best of all worlds.  It relies on a well-known port (say 501) that is reserved for ESPUDP encapsulation.  The way to distinguish data from control packets on this port is to observe the Security Parameters Index (SPI) field of the [ESP] header (it is the first four bytes of the header).  The ESP standard clearly states that a value of zero for this field MUST NOT be sent on the wire.  We can leverage this by making control packets begin with four bytes of zero immediately following the UDP header. In order to allow some generality in packet types used for control data on the ESPUDP port, I propose that the four bytes of zero are immediately followed by two bytes of  Control Type  and two bytes of  Control Data .  The values in the  Control Type  field specify the type of control data immediately following.  We can allow the  Control Type  value of one to mean that this is key-exchange control packet.  The  Control Data  field specifies what sort of key-exchange is being used.  There could be values for IKE, KINK, etc. I propose reserving the  Control Type  value of zero to mean that this is a private format control packet known only to the two parties.  In this case the  Control Data  field and the contents of the packet is only meaningful to the two hosts that are communicating.  The XBox will use this escape mechanism when trying to establish NAT connectivity with a peer XBox.  An example would be a control packet that tells the peer XBox to send a  sacrifice  packet back to the other peer in order to open a port mapping in the NAT.  Another example would be a control packet that initiates a key-exchange between two XBoxes in a non-standard way. This scheme has the advantage that the packet format for data, by far the most common and most important format, has no additional overhead added to it and yet is still easily distinguishable from a control packet.  It also makes for a better story to manufacturers of hardware offload cards.  They just need to watch for UDP on a given port that has a non-zero SPI at a fixed offset in the packet to know when hardware offload is necessary.  Finally, it allows an escape mechanism for private control packets to also be multiplexed on the port, which is a requirement of the XBox peer-to-peer strategy. Key Exchange To Servers Having a packet format that supports authenticating payloads doesn t do you much good unless both sides of the conversation know how to hash and verify the payloads.  They must agree on an authentication method and must both have the same secret key.  This can be as simple as both sides having a pre-shared key stored locally, in which case the key can be used either directly or used to encrypt a session key to be used for subsequent packet authentication. The online security model for XBox uses Kerberos to authenticate XBoxes and users.  Each XBox will have a private certificate on the hard disk that was created and signed during manufacturing.  This certificate will be used only once when connecting to the XBox Online Service for the first time.  Its purpose is to authenticate that fact that it is indeed an XBox and not a PC masquerading as an XBox.  The XBox Online Service will create a Passport account for the XBox and will construct a strong password to that account.  The password is stored on the hard disk of the XBox. When an XBox logs on to the Online Service, it contacts the Passport KDC, authenticates itself by using its strong password, and is given a ticket-granting-ticket (TGT).  The XBox then contacts the XBox KDC and presents the TGT to acquire tickets to one or more services.  The Passport KDC and XBox KDC have established a trust relationship between themselves.  The Passport KDC includes all of the XBox machine accounts and XBox user accounts.  The principals in the XBox KDC, however, are the game server and infrastructure computers that host the XBox Online Service.  In particular, the XBox KDC does not contain XBox machine accounts or user accounts. One of the service tickets that every XBox will acquire is a  Connection Server  ticket.  This grants the XBox permission to establish authenticated communication with any CS, not just a particular server.  The fact that the XBox has acquired a service ticket is sufficient to authenticate itself to a server in the XBox Online Service that provides the requested service. The XBox will open an outgoing connection to its chosen CS to UDP port 501 (how it figures out which CS is TBD).  The fact that there might be a NAT in between the XBox and the CS is not a serious issue at this point.  All NATs will allow UDP outgoing communication to any destination port.  The only twist here is that the XBox will specify 501 as the return port, but the NAT will change this to some other port.  All of our servers will note and use the new port for replies instead sending directly to 501. The first communication that needs to take place between the XBox and CS is a key-exchange protocol for mutual authentication and consensus on a session key to use for subsequent authenticated communication.  The exact protocol to use is yet to be determined, but IKE-Kerberos is one possibility.  Another possibility is  Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys  (KINK).  The advantage of KINK is that it is supposed to be more lightweight than IKE-Kerberos.   Complexity of key-exchange is a very important consideration for the XBox client.  We have already decided to use Kerberos for authentication, so it makes sense to choose a key exchange protocol that leverages this fact.  But more importantly, our network stack must use as little memory as possible while a game is running.  In particular, the following requirements must be met by whatever key exchange protocol we settle on.  It should make use of the service ticket that was acquired once when the game contacted the XBox KDC at logon time.  And it should have simple encryption and hashing requirements.  In particular, it must not require public-key cryptography and/or Diffie-Hellman algorithms to be resident in memory as the footprint would be too large and our game developers would have a reason to push back on us doing anything for security as a result.  It is my hope that KINK satisfies these requirements, but I have not read the documentation for it carefully enough yet. The Windows Networking team currently does not implement ESPUDP, at least not in the packet format promoted above.  It also does not currently have an implementation of KINK, which is understandable since the specification was only released a few weeks ago.  To make progress while the selection of final key exchange protocols are worked out, I intend to implement simple IKE with pre-shared key as the easiest way to achieve interoperability with a Windows server running a private drop of the IPSec driver that supports ESPUDP. After the key exchange step is complete, both sides will have established a Security Association with one another and all subsequent traffic will be encapsulated and authenticated using the newly acquired session key and the ESPUDP packet format. Before the XBox can establish communication with a server, it must call XNetRegisterServiceAddress and pass it the IP address of the server to contact along with the Kerberos ticket to use during key-exchange.  The function returns a private IP address to use with DPLAY or WINSOCK. When a packet is addressed to this private IP address, the IP layer on the XBox notices that communication has not been established and so will initiate a key-exchange protocol with the server (hopefully something lightweight like KINK) and will use the Kerberos ticket registered to authenticate and exchange a private session key. The game title can call XNetUnregisterAddress with the private IP address previously allocated when it is no longer interested in communication with the server.  This will immediately terminate communication between the XBox and the server, so the game title should have closed all sockets gracefully before calling this function. If the game title running on the XBox attempts to use DPLAY or WINSOCK to open a connection directly to a server (by passing in a real IP address), the IP layer will not initiate communication with the server and will drop the packet.  This prevents the title developer from establishing unauthenticated communication.  For debugging purposes, however, we will support unauthenticated communication so that an XBox may communicate with a PC, but only in the debug build and never in the retail build.  Alternatively, if the game title can know if it has been signed by Microsoft, the function which the game title uses to bypass secure communications for a given IP address will do nothing if it knows this executable has been signed. Even if the game title is not allowed to bypass secure communications, the XBox Online Services component in a game title will still be able to do so in order to communicate with the Passport KDC and the XBox KDC.  If we allow the encrypted package download utilities to open HTTP connections to servers that are not running IPSec, we will have to allow these utilities (written by us) to specify IP addresses to bypass secure communications as well. Key Exchange Between XBoxes For peer-to-peer communication between XBoxes there is no Kerberos service ticket.  Instead the key exchange protocol will be private to the XBox and will make use of the  Control Type  of zero.  The  Control Data  field will indicate that this packet contains key exchange information. The typical peer-to-peer scenario during game play involves one of the XBoxes registering its intention to initiate a game play session with other players on the Internet.  Call this machine XB1.  XB1 obtains a ticket to the matchmaking service so that it can establish authenticated communication with the server.  It then makes a request to publish a new game session, thus making it available to other XBoxes who are likewise connected to the matchmaking service waiting for an interesting game session to be published. XB1 sends its  complete address  (described earlier) to the matchmaking service, and the service constructs a unique session ID and a unique key-exchange-key and returns both to XB1 encrypted using the session key.  Then XB1 decrypts the unique session ID and key-exchange-key and calls XNetRegisterPeerSession passing in the session ID and the key-exchange-key it obtained.  Now another XBox, call it XB2, contacts the matchmaking service and notices the game session and wants to participate.  The matchmaking service sends XB2 the  complete address  of XB1 along with the session ID and the key-exchange-key for this session, all encrypted using the session key established between XB2 and the matchmaking service.  XB2 then calls XNetRegisterPeerSession with the session ID and key-exchange-key.  Before using DPLAY or WINSOCK to initiate communication with XB1, XB2 must have a four-byte IP address for XB1, but all it has is the  complete address .  As described earlier, XB2 simply calls XNetRegisterPeerAddress, passing in the  complete address  of XB2 and the session ID and it gets in return a private IP address it can use. When a packet is addressed to this private IP address, the IP layer on the XBox notices that communication has not been established and so will run one of the NAT hole opening algorithms.  Once that completes, potentially after several round-trips and retries, the key-exchange protocol then takes place.  One of the peers will generate a unique session key and will pass it to the other by encrypting it with the key-exchange-key associated with the session ID given earlier to XNetRegisterPeerAddress.  After both sides have agreed on the session key to use, the original packet is encapsulated using ESPUDP, the payload is hashed using the session key, and it is transmitted to its destination. When the first key-exchange packet arrives on an XBox, it will contain the session ID of a game session.  The XBox will use the session ID to look up the key-exchange-key to use during this exchange.  If the session ID is not found in the table of registered sessions, this means the XBox has never called XNetRegisterPeerSession and therefore is not interested in receiving incoming connections for that session and will reject the attempt to establish a secure connection.  If the session ID is found, the key-exchange-key is used to authenticate the other side and to exchange a private session key to be used for authentication of communication between these two peers. The game title can call XNetUnregisterAddress with the private IP address previously allocated when it is no longer interested in communication with the peer.  This will immediately terminate communication between the XBox and the peer, so the game title should have closed all sockets gracefully before calling this function.  It can call XNetUnregisterPeerSession when it is no longer interested in communicating with any peers in the session.  This call will most likely automatically unregister all peer addresses that were registered on the session. LAN Play When two or more XBoxes are connected directly via a cross-cable or an Ethernet hub, a game title can offer a multiplayer experience known as LAN play.  It differs from Internet play in that there is no contact with the XBox Online Service infrastructure, and it is free of charge.  The XBox will never contact Passport or our KDC, will never obtain a Kerberos ticket, and will never contact any computer other than a peer XBox on the same LAN segment. Even when running in LAN play mode, we still want to require all communication to be authenticated to help prevent denial-of-service attacks, cheating, hacking, and buffer-overrun exploits.  Of course, since we don t have any way of authenticating the XBox through Kerberos, we are left with using pre-shared keys that are hidden in the game title. The typical scenario for discovery of available game sessions would be as follows.  An XBox, call it XB1, decides to publish a game session.  It calls XNetCreateLANSession that generates a unique session ID and a unique key-exchange-key, just like the matchmaking service did for the online case.  It then calls XNetRegisterPeerSession with this information, and calls WINSOCK to listen for incoming connections.  Finally, it calls XNetRegisterBroadcastKey with the pre-shared key hidden in the title, and calls WINSOCK to begin listening for broadcasts.  Another XBox, call it XB2, wishes to discover the available sessions so it calls XNetRegisterBroadcastKey with the same pre-shared key hidden in the title, and then uses WINSOCK to send a broadcast packet in ESPUDP format that is authenticated with the pre-shared key, and begins listening for responses. XB1 will receive the broadcast packet and will respond with its game session information.  It does this by first calling XNetRegisterLANAddress passing in the IP address of the XB2 it obtained from WINSOCK along with NULL for the session ID.  This allocates a private IP address that can be passed to WINSOCK to open a connection and send the response, which should include at a minimum the unique session ID and key-exchange-key for the game session being published.  The NULL session ID instructs the XNet stack to authenticate the packets using the broadcast key instead of performing full XBox-to-XBox key-exchange.  The ESPUDP packet will be marked with a special SPI (such as 1) that means the default security association whose key was specified by a call to XNetRegisterBroadcastKey.  This is done to prevent a flood of responses from available game sessions swamping the querying XBox with requests for key-exchange and the setting up of Security Associations.  This means, of course, that replay protection is disabled for these responses since this SPI is many-to-one.  The game title will have to be resilient to replay for responses by using nonces and encrypting parts of the broadcast and response payloads with the pre-shared key.  The XNet stack will probably only allow UDP responses to use this mechanism to discourage long-term connections. XB2 now has received one or more responses including the one from XB1.  Inside the response is the encrypted unique session ID and key-exchange-key along with any other information about the game session being published.  If it wishes to open a connection to XB1 to join the game session, it calls XNetRegisterPeerSession with the session ID and key-exchange-key.  Then calls XNetRegisterLANAddress with the IP address for XB1 and the session ID and gets back a private IP address that it can pass to DPLAY or WINSOCK to open a connection.  At this point the XNet stack behaves the same as described in the previous section, including performing peer-to-peer key-exchange using the key-exchange-key of the session. It might be advantageous to automatically encrypt as well as authenticate the payloads of LAN broadcast packets and the UDP responses.  This would make sure that a title developer didn t reveal the session ID and key-exchange-key during the negotiation, and would make the LAN discovery code easier to write since portions of a packet no longer need to be manually encrypted.  This has the added benefit that it will discourage title developers from being too verbose in responding to broadcasts, which should keep the usage of the mechanism to a minimum. Memory Requirements This design is very conscious of exactly how much memory is necessary to provide NAT connectivity and security.  The game title will have an initialization API where it will specify the maximum number of Kerberos tickets that will be acquired, the maximum number of game sessions that can be handled at once, the maximum number of incoming and outgoing connections, the size of the packet pool, and other configuration information such as buffer sizes.  These will be hard limits, and the game title developer must choose these constants wisely.  Fortunately, a game title will typically know this information. Besides the data requirements, the code size requirements of this design are modest.  The biggest influences on code size will be the size of the Kerberos client and the size of the key-exchange mechanism for communicating with servers via a service ticket.  The current code size for the XNet stack is in the 50K area.  I think it should be possible to add the Kerberos client and all of the functions needed to implement this design in no more than an additional 50K of code.  This will require some aggressive coding to pull off, and a real commitment from the Windows IPSec team to help us come up with the right set of key-exchange protocols which allows us to meet these requirements.  This might mean a private drop of the IPSec driver for Windows 2000 and Whistler that supports an XBox-specific key-exchange protocol if KINK turns out to be inappropriate and we can t come up with another standard protocol which satisfies our requirements. Future Directions In a future release of the XBox Online Service, it is possible that we may wish to deploy a custom routing scheme implemented with routers that we deploy at key locations around the globe and that have access to more efficient backbones, pretty much as described in the XRG strategy.  This might be a premium service that a player could pay for to achieve a superior gaming experience because we will offer more controlled latency.  Or the routing mesh might be used to route traffic between XBox peers that are behind incompatible NATs and there is no other way to achieve connectivity.  If we find that the number of such NATs is large, we may be forced to invent a routing solution, though it need not be on a fast backbone or   population centers if it is only going to be used as a connectivity fallback plan. It is possible to extend the functions described in this design to support the simultaneous use of direct XBox to server connections, direct XBox to XBox connections (where possible), and XBox to XBox connections via our routing mesh.  We can even allow the game title to choose which traffic should be placed on the latency-controlled network by extending the XNetRegisterPeerAddress function to take a flag indicating the latency preference.  Game titles that wanted to communicate with a peer on the routing mesh in addition to directly would just call the XNetRegisterPeerAddress function twice with different flags.  The game title would then use WINSOCK to connect using the appropriate IP address depending on whether the connection is latency sensitive or not. Dependencies This design mentions several dependencies to other groups at Microsoft, and we need to be sure that we have solid commitments from these groups to deliver the needed functionality in time to deploy the XBox Online Service. The first dependency is on Passport to implement the Kerberos KDC so that we can create machine accounts and obtain ticket-granting tickets for our XBox KDC.  It is this KDC that kicks off the entire security story, so we need to stay on top of this and push for it to be implemented sooner rather than later.  If Passport screws us and they don t deliver in time, we will have to build a KDC that can support millions of accounts as a fallback plan. The second dependency is on the Windows IPSec team.  They need to understand what it is we expect from them and we need to have buyoff at the appropriate level that they will deliver it to us in time.  The current list of deliverables and action items is: Deliver source code for the Windows implementation of the IPSec driver for reference purposes when coding the equivalent on the XBox. Nail down the ESPUDP packet format, especially when it comes to differentiating control from data traffic.  Agree on which well known port will be used (contact IANA to register a port if necessary). Deliver source code for and pointers to documentation for implementing IKE with pre-shared key as a first cut at establishing connectivity between XBox and Windows IPSec implementations. Deliver an implementation of IPSec for Windows that supports ESPUDP and supports IKE with pre-shared key as soon as possible. Decide if KINK meets the small-and-fast requirements of XBox client and if so commit to implementing it on the Windows IPSec driver as soon as possible. Commit to implementing a private XBox-only version of key-exchange using Kerberos tickets in a private drop of the Windows IPSec driver if absolutely necessary to hit XBox Online ship dates. Commit to delivering a final implementation of ESPUDP IPSec for Windows that runs on both Windows 2000 and Whistler.  Waiting for Whistler server to ship is yet another dependency that we want to avoid. Implementation Schedule It is difficult to come up with precise schedules at this point, but a general plan of attack for implementing this design is as follows: Modify XNet to support packet framing in ESPUDP for certain IP addresses.  The initial implementation will bypass IPSec unless turned on explicitly for a given IP address in order to keep all network clients working, such as the debugger and the PC to XBox file transfer system. Implement functionality for LAN play, including support for encrypted broadcast and responses. Modify DPLAY session discovery for LAN case to use the new mechanism.   Make changes to all current network clients including the debugging connection and filter transfer system to allow them to continue working when IPSec becomes the default.  Turn IPSec on by default for LAN play.  Shoot for shipping with May SDK. Implement functionality for Internet play, starting with IKE with pre-shared key. Obtain prototype Windows IPSec driver.  Test XBox to server authentication. Implement algorithms for opening NAT holes.  Test peer-to-peer connectivity. Implement XBox to XBox key exchange.  Test peer-to-peer authentication. Implement XBox to server key exchange with Kerberos tickets.  Test XBox to server authentication. Turn IPSec on by default always. Comments?

Erik Arthur is creating another document that describes all the titleID changes needed throughout the Xbox organization. That document is still the definitive document in regards to how the titleID changes affect all the groups. The purpose of this document is just to describe the changes as it relates to Live. NOTE.  As of 1/9/06   the concept of the LiveTitleID and the LiveAltTitleID has been postponed.  For the time being   the LiveTitleID is the same as the titleID on the disc.  LiveAltTitleID is NOT used.  You may read the document here for the original intent of LiveTitleID and LiveAltTitleID   but it is currently NOT used and may never be used.  Note that the functionality is implemented   just not tested and verified.  This is true for both LiveTitleID and LiveAltTitleID.  Much testing is needed before this feature can be brought online into production. LiveTitleID Xenon will use a new term known as ExecutionIDs to identify individual titles.  For purposes of Live, we will work with something we will call a LiveTitleID.  The format of a LiveTitleID is the same as a TitleID in Xbox   4 bytes   DWORD.  The higher order 2 bytes will identify the publisher and low order 2 bytes will identify the set of binaries.  Note that the ExecutionID spec contains information about a PublisherID and a GameID which is very similar to the LiveTitleID when combined.  It should be noted, however, that the combination of PublisherID and GamerID may NOT be the LiveTitleID though most of the time it will be.  Further information is provided below. This new concept is introduced because of the introduction of ExecutionIDs   which contain a LOT more information about a title than the TitleID of Xbox.  Instead of changing our entire Live backend to match ExecutionIDs   which is very complex and requires many changes to the system   we have decided to map ExecutionIDs to LiveTitleIDs to preserve the work we ve done and use the existing system (including TitleIDs) as is and make only minor changes. In Xenon, the following information is passed to the KDC TitleID (PublisherID and GameID combined) TitleVersion TitleRegion ConsoleRegion MediaID (DiscMediaID in the ExecutionID spec) LanguageID With this information, the KDC will determine which LiveTitleID to return to the client in the ticket and will be used henceforth by the client to communicate with the service.  For the majority of times, the LiveTitleID will be the TitleID in the request.  However, in some instances, it may be different.  For example, let s assume TitleA is published in North America by Microsoft.  The TitleID would be 0x4d530077.  But this same title (TitleA) pubished in Europe may have a different PublisherID and even a different GameID   say, 0x53450089.  For intents and purposes, however, these two are exactly the same game and same binaries   but because of publisher differences the TitleID has been changed dramatically.  In North America   the LiveTitleID of TitleA may be 0x4d530077.  Then when the European title comes in for login, the KDC recognizes that TitleID 0x53450089 is really the same as TitleID 0x4d530077 and so will RETURN a LiveTitleID of 0x4d530077 for this title to use for subsequent Live calls. Here is an example: For one reason or another, two compatible versions of a Live game got signed as 2 different TitleIDs (perhaps because of human error or because the save game format was incompatible or something like that). From the Live perspective, we want both of these games to appear as if they are the same game so that content download and reporting is all done accurately. To do this, we simply make both TitleIDs map to the same LiveTitleID, thus making both TitleIDs appear as if they were just one LiveTitleID within the Live world. Note that we have only given the title a LiveTitleID and nothing else.  It continues to use its version and region and other information and may still be denied resources based on those other criterion. LiveAltTitleID A single LiveTitleID sometimes may NOT fulfill the requirements of a publisher.  There is sometimes a need to share resources between two or more titles of a family.  This is covered in Family TitleIDs.  (Please see related spec in related documents section.)  Family TitleIDs alone unfortunately is still not enough.  There are still times when a title may want to essentially BE another title when using a specific service.  For this reason, we created a LiveAltTitleID. An example is illustrated here.  Two titles, Halo2 in the US and Halo2 in EU have different XeMIDs, but we have mapped them to the same LiveTitleID so that to Live, this is really just one title and have shared privileges.  Halo2 in EU needs to have some content download available   only in EU.  Since they now have the same LiveTitleID   it is impossible to just have a package made for EU Halo2 since they both have the same LiveTitleID.  To solve this, the Halo2 title in EU may use a LiveAltTitleID for a specific service   content download.  In this case, two LiveTitleIDs can have different content download packages made available to it. The KDC can change up to four (4) ServiceID/LiveAltTitleID pairs if needed, which allows the system to change the effective LiveTitleID for some services to be different than all the other services. Both LiveTitleID and LiveAltTitleID changes are sent to the client and will be used by the client to communicate with other servers. Note that this substitution can be done BEFORE the game publishes (requested by the developer/publisher) or AFTER.  Of course, doing it after the game ships is fairly risky and should be tested before being enabled. Service Feature Design In order to support both LiveTitleIDs and LiveAltTitleIDs   we need to make a couple of changes. LiveTitleID changes The following are changes that need to be made to support LiveTitleID. Build the necessary tool to specify the mapping from a set of information to a LiveTitleID.  This may be part of existing tools or new tools.  Note the necessary tools are also required to change these settings AFTER the game has shipped.   Changes to the KDC to accept info passed up during login and return an effective LiveTitleID in the Pre-Auth and AuthData structure.  Info passed up will include: TitleID (PublisherID and GameID combined) Title Version Title Region Console Region MediaID (DiscMediaID in the ExecutionID spec) LanguageID Changes to the client APIs to USE the returned LiveTitleID in the Pre-Auth in ALL Live requests Modify VerifyTitleID in SGInfo to accept the effective LiveTitleID as opposed to the TitleID (PublisherID and GameID concatenated). LiveAltTitleID changes The following are changes that need to be made to support LiveAltTitleID. Build the necessary tool to specify the LiveAltTitleID/service mapping.  This may be part of existing tools or new tools.  Note the necessary tools are also required to change these settings AFTER the game has shipped.  Note that up to four (4) LiveAltTitleIDs/service mappings are allowed per title.  For the time being, however, only the following service(s) will support a LiveAltTitleID: Content Download Changes to the KDC to read the LiveAltTitleID information from its data repository and return this information to the client in the Pre-Auth data and the Auth Data. Changes to the client APIs to replace the LiveTitleID with the LiveAltTitleID when requesting a specific service that has a LiveAltTitleID specific. Modify VerifyTitleID in SGInfo to accept the effective LiveAltTitleID for a specific service where applicable.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. <<Spec Name>> Title<<Spec Name>> ravim Template - Quick Spec.dot Tony Chen Microsoft Office Wordurn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PersonName http://www.microsoft.com )p{GbbjbjqPqP Xenon XMACS Protocol Author: Tony Chen Executive Summary XMACS stands for Xbox Machine Account Creation Server. The purpose of the XMACS protocol is for the XMACS server to authenticate the console based on information we placed on the console during manufacturing, and then securely send a new set of symmetric key credentials back to the console for the console to use for future machine authentication. In Xbox 1, we used symmetric keys to authenticate the console during the XMACS exchange. In Xenon, we will be using public key cryptography and certificates to authenticate Xenon machines. This document describes the wire protocol changes needed on the XMACS Kerberos exchange to do this. What is stored on each Xenon console On each Xenon box, an RSA key pair called OnlineRSAKey will be randomly generated. The public key of this key pair will be signed into a certificate by computing: RSASign( MasterSigningKey.Private ,          ConsoleID |   | Timestamp | OnlineRSAKey.Public ) where MasterSigningKey.Private is a 2048 bit private key held in an nCipher device kept in a locked room in our Xenon factories. The XMACS server will need to know MasterSigningKey.Public to verify these certificates. The ConsoleID is a unique number that defines the console, but it is different than the console serial number printed on the bottom of the box. OnlineRSAKey.Private and the above certificate will be flashed into the Xenon ROM for each console and the hypervisor will support encrypting data with the private key without ever exposing the actual key to any non-hypervisor code. The OnlineRSAKey.Private key will be stored in a manner that makes it hard for the average hacker to figure out from the ROM image. The ConsoleID along with the 20 byte SHA1 hash value of the signed certificate is recorded in genealogy. This SHA1 value is not useful to XMACS under normal circumstances but will become useful if MasterSigningKey.Private is ever compromised. Goals of the New XMACS Protocol The goals we want to achieve in the XMACS Kerberos exchange are: Securely send a new Machine PUID and Key back to the Xenon client. Nobody sniffing the communication should be able to figure out what the machine PUID and Key values are unless they know what OnlineRSAKey.Private is. The XMACS server must believe that the client is authentic and manufactured by Microsoft using MasterSigningKey.Private. The Xenon client must believe that the XMACS server is authentic and trust that the PUID/Key pair sent back to it is the one that the official Microsoft XMACS server sent. It needs to be resilient to DoS attacks. We must have a plan to deal with a small number of OnlineRSAKey.Private keys being compromised. We must have a fallback plan if MasterSigningKey.Private is compromised. What the New Protocol Looks Like Before we describe the algorithm, let s first layout some notation: ConsoleID: Unique ID that identifies this console. MasterXMACSKey: 2048 bit RSA Key pair used to authenticate the XMAC server to client machines. MasterXMACSKey.Private is kept in an nCipher device on the XMACS server. MasterXMACSKey.Public is hard coded in LIve.XEX. OnlineRSAKey: 1024 bit RSA key pair that is different for each console. MasterSigningKey: 2048 bit RSA key pair that is used to sign certificates containing OnlineRSAKey.Public at the factory. AuthTime: 8 byte current timestamp. SessionKey: Random 128 bit symmetric key used in the authentication protocol. This takes place of the pre-established symmetric key that is traditionally used during Kerberos authentication. MachinePUID, MachineKey: The new PUID/Key pair generated for the target Xenon console. Here is how the authentication works: The client performs a DNS lookup on MACS2.XBOXLIVE.COM to find the IP address of the XMACS server for Xenon consoles. The client randomly generates a SessionKey and sends a Kerberos AS request with ConsoleID as the authenticating principal. The current AuthTime in the TimestampPreauth of the request is encrypted with SessionKey. i.e. (This is required in standard Kerberos): RC4HMACEncrypt(SessionKey, AuthTime) Another special Xenon preauth is added to the request containing the following: RSAEncrypt(MasterXMACSKey.Public, SessionKey) RSASign(OnlineRSAKey.Private, AuthTime|SHA1(SessionKey)) RSASign(MasterSigningKey.Private,ConsoleID| |Timestamp|OnlineRSAKey.Public) The XMACS Server upon receiving the request, first verifies the certificate by using MasterSigningKey.Public to verify that the certificate really is for ConsoleID and extracts the OnlineRSAKey.Public key. Then is uses OnlineRSAKey.Public to retrieve the signed AuthTime and SHA1(SessionKey). The XMACS server checks that AuthTime is within 2 minutes from the current time. Then it uses MasterXMACSKey.Private to figure out what SessionKey is. Then it verifies that the SHA1 value of the SessionKey from step 8 equals the value retrieved in step 6. If not, the request is rejected. Then it uses the SessionKey to decrypt the TimestampPreauth and sees what AuthTime is. It checks to make sure that the AuthTime extracted in step 10 and step 6 are the same. If everything is OK, the server then creates (or resets) the machine account and obtains MachinePUID and MachineKey. The XMACS Server then sends an AS reply to the client with another special preauth added that contains the following: RC4HMACEncrypt(SessionKey, AuthTime | MachinePUID | MachineKey) The client decrypts this with its SessionKey and verifies that AuthTime is the same time that was sent. Only if they are the same should the client believe that it is talking to a genuine Microsoft XMACS server and accept its MachinePUID and MachineKey for use. This is because, the server could not have known what SessionKey was and correctly encrypt the response unless it knew what MasterXMACSKey.Private was. Note that no Genealogy DB lookup is required in this plan. This makes XMACS resilient to DoS attacks. The Fallback Plan If any OnlineRSAKey.Private keys are compromised and we find out about it, we will need to put that ConsoleID into a revocation List that we maintain and reject for future XMACS authentication. We anticipate the number of such cases to be small (i.e. less than 100). We will need to have code ready to deal with this revocation list ready for Xenon launch. If MasterXMACSKey.Private is ever compromised from our data center, we will need to auto-update Live.XEX on all Xenon clients to use a different key pair. We do NOT plan on having code ready to do this at Xenon launch. If MasterSigningKey.Private is compromised, we will need to revert back to using genealogy again. Because genealogy records the SHA1 digest of every certificate we signed at the factory. We can modify step 5 to also check that the SHA1 digest of the supplied certificate matches what we have stored in the genealogy DB for that particular ConsoleID. We do NOT plan on having code ready to do this at Xenon launch. Microsoft Confidential Xenon XMACS Protocol Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES  gdy"] gdy"] gdy"] gdy"]

Xj6w1Z 1T5-+Q 1Riv7Establishing a VPN Connection to TestNet By Sean Wohlgemuth These instructions are for establishing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to the TestNet environment for Windows XP.  Launching the Network Connection Wizard Run the  New Connection Wizard  and select  Selecting Network Connection Type Select  Connect to the network at my workplace  and then select  Selecting your Connection Type Select  Virtual Private Network connection  and then select  Naming your Connection Specify a Name for your VPN Connection and then select  Dismissing Connection Dependencies  Select  Do not dial the initial connection  and then select  Specifying a Connection Name or IP Address Specify the IP address or hostname for the VPN server and select  You can either enter an IP Address here or a Name here. Suggestion:  If you create entries in your local host file for all TestNet machine then add an entries like  DeepTunnel1  and  DeepTunnel2  that do a name to IP mapping.  This way you only have to keep your IP Addresses up-to-date in a single location (in this case that is the local host file). Currently, the IP Addresses are: Deep Tunnel #1: 10.198.102.223 (Use when talking to XePoolIIS machine VIP) Deep Tunnel #2: 10.198.102.222 (Use when talking to XePoolIIS machines directly) Dismissing Smart Card Options Select  Do not use my smart card  and then select  This dialog will only be presented if you have a smartcard reader attached to your PC. Limiting Scope of Connection Select  My use only  and then select  Automatically Generating a Connection Shortcut If you want shortcuts placed on your desktop, select  Add a shortcut to this connection to my desktop  and then select  Finish Configuring Advanced Settings Double click the shortcut created on your desktop or click to connect to this connection from your Network connection list.  Select  Properties  from the credentials dialog. Enabling Domain Logon Select  Include Windows logon domain  from the  Options  tab. Networking Properties From the  Networking  tab, highlight  Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)  and then select  Properties Advanced Networking Properties From the next dialog box, select  Advanced Configuring Default Gateways From the  General  tab, unselect  Use default gateway on remote network Now, select   on all dialogs until you return to the credentials dialog. Acquiring Credentials and Connecting Contact the Xbox Live Operations Team if you do not already have credentials for the  Test.Live  domain to acquire your credentials.  After acquiring credentials, enter your  User name Password , and  Domain .  For the Test.Live domain, only use   as your domain in the credentials dialog.  Now, press  Connect  to establish a connection. Setting up Static Routes to Route Specific Network Traffic to Corpnet Facing Servers (Can t connect to Source Depot Problem). In order to connect to things like our source depot server while connected to the TestNet VPNs, you will have to establish a static route to route your network traffic through your corpnet default gateway.  The most common problem is trying to talk to the Source Depot server while connected to the TestNet VPN.  This is because the corpnet facing interfaces for these servers collide with an internal TestNet IP Address range. While not connected to your VPN, execute an IpConfig command to acquire your Default Gateway on Corpnet: Now execute a Route Print command to get a list of your interfaces: Now construct a static route with Route Add: Note: the use of  P makes the route persist amongst restarts.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Although we are still a bit away from seeing new setup code, I wanted to let all developers know that the deployment story for SQL databases is, for the non-Webstore/SQL Notification case, migrating to MSI based setups TitleAlthough we are still a bit away from seeing new setup code, I wanted to let all developers know that the deployment story for SQL databases is, for the non-Webstore/SQL Notification case, migrating to MSI based setups Michio Nikaido Normal.dot Michio Nikaido Microsoft Office WordbjbjqPqP Although we are still a bit away from seeing new setup code, I wanted to let all developers know that the deployment story for SQL databases is, for the non-Webstore/SQL Notification case, migrating to MSI based setups.  This is in no small part thanks to the integrated WiX (Windows Installer XML) support that is in the new CoreXT system (thanks Steve and Nataly!). At this point, I ve taken the known, non-Webstore/non-SQL Notification, based databases and translated their old SQLINSTALL.WSF setups into a corresponding .MSIs.  More specifically, there are now .wxs (WiX source) files checked into \private\msi\sql that create MSIs for all the databases that have now been converted and drop them to \drop\*\msi at the end of the normal build process: Genealogy:  gene_sql.wxs Matchmaking:  mtch_sql.wxs Non-partitioned DB:   npdb_sql.wxs Tools DB:   tool_sql.wxs Web DB:   wbdb_sql.wxs XQuery DB:   xqry_sql.wxs <template>:  mydb_sql.wxs My expectation here is that DEV should be able to handle any simple changes to the setup process for these databases very easily now.  You will still have to get any schema changes (.SQL scripts added/edited/deleted) checked into the correct place and possibly modify any build files (makefile.inc/sources) to drop the changed scripts to the correct drop directory, that doesn t change.  However, once that has been done, you will want to check out and modify the .wxs script to include/exclude the changed file. In order to add (for example) a new .SQL schema script during the database setup, you would need to add two elements: a <Binary> element at the bottom of the file and a <SQLString> element inside the <SQLDatabase> node.  The <Binary> element configures the MSI to include the actual .SQL script as part of the package while the <SQLString> element instructs the installer to play the script into the database as it is being constructed.  Basically, cutting/pasting/editing the existing contents should be straightforward.  There are only a few other things to watch out for: Make sure you do not reuse a Sequence value in any copy/pasted <SQLString> elements  Make sure that you reference files in the <Binary> elements relative to the build drop, and not the source files.  This is to ensure that any post-processing that occurs on the schema .sql scripts (E.G. Version stamping) is picked up in the files that are stuffed into the .MSIs  If you create a new .wxs file, make sure that you do not reuse any Guid values  After that, you can rebuild the \private\sql tree (to get the updated files pushed to the \drop subtree), and then rebuild the \private\msi\sql directory to get the new .MSIs built.  With this level of integration with the build, I believe it fair to expect that any developer making changes to database schema be responsible for building out the corresponding MSI and testing the MSI to ensure that the schema change is safe and is not disruptive to the overall installation of the database. Disclaimer: There s an open issue right now with how these installers should include user accounts (domain accounts) into the standard SQL Roles that it creates (ClientLib, AdminLib, ReaderLib).  The basic issue is that, because the accounts will change from domain to domain, they can t be coded into the .MSI.  That information should properly come from the Configuration DB, but the MSI isn t designed to (in its current form) interact with the Configuration DB to get that sort of data.  Expect more development on this topic.

Xbox Live Communication
 
If you connect your Xbox to the Internet, it may communicate occasionally with the Xbox Live service for a number of reasons:
 
         To see if updates are available for your Xbox Live Dashboard.
         To see if updates or new content (for example, levels or characters) are available for your games.
         To help configure your network settings if you are modifying them
         When you attempt to set up a new Xbox Live account or manage/recover an existing account.
 
Dashboard updates are intended to enhance security, provide additional Dashboard functionality, and/or provide sign-up support as Xbox Live is launched in new markets. As part of the Xbox Live Dashboard update process, certain files and directories in the Dashboard system area will be deleted and new files created. This will not affect saved games, accounts, downloaded content, or soundtracks currently accessible from a game or the Xbox Dashboard.  
 
Whenever the Xbox needs to communicate with the Xbox Live service, it will need to send the service your unique Xbox serial number. To preserve the integrity and security of the Xbox Live service, this serial number is sent to the service with every communication. This number is used to create a unique machine account for your Xbox, enabling the Xbox Live service to confirm that a valid Xbox is attempting to communicate. This serial number information is not used for any other purpose. 
 
Note: These communications occur only if your Xbox is connected to the Internet. To prevent communication with the Xbox Live service from happening, you will need to disconnect your Xbox from the Internet.
