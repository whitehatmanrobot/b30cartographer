It will follow the new command-line format that the ISPU Group has agreed to.  CHKTRUST.EXE (verify  the Signed Catalog file and its members): This will verify both the signed Catalog file itself, as well as, its individual members. This is an existing utility   the changes include adding a command-line parameter to pass in the Catalog file name and  Member Tag  to enable the verification of the Catalog file s Members, additions to MSSIP32.DLL, and a new installable Trust Provider. CRYPT32.DLL (CryptSIPRetrieveSubjectGuid): This function will be modified to identify the Catalog file. These files will be full PKCS#7 MSSIP32.DLL (Catalog file SIP addition): The Catalog SIP will be used for both the Signing and Verifying process of the actual Catalog file. MSCAT32.DLL (CDF and Catalog File Functions): This library will contain all of the Catalog CDF Parsing and Catalog API sets. Create the Unsigned Catalog File Define/develop the CDF API Set: These APIs will be part of MSCAT32.DLL.  They are specific to parsing the IExpress (*.CDF) file for the Catalog specific entries.  These include Catalog Header information, Member information, and Attribute information.  These APIs are strictly for extracting the information from the IExpress file (*.CDF). Define/develop the Catalog API Set: These APIs will be part of MSCAT32.DLL.  They are specific to creating, in memory, the format needed by the  Certificate Trust List  APIs.  They will also take the output from the  Certificate Trust List  and store it in the Catalog file. Develop Command-line Tool (MAKECAT.EXE): This utility will use the CDF, SIP, and Catalog API sets to create the P7U.  Initial internal release (May 19th) will just have a consistent command-line parameter set, correctly parse the CDF file, and be callable from a build-script file.  This is to allow the build labs to start creating the necessary entries in the CDF file and the build scripts. Create the Signed Catalog File Catalog SIP (PutSignedMessage): This is part of the new Catalog SIP. It is designed to add the signature to the Catalog file   creating the P7S file.  The PutSignedMessage will take a SIP_INDIRECT_DATA structure and call the CryptMsgSignCTL ( Certificate Trust List  API).   This operation will add the SignerInfo structure to create the P7S file   this is the final Catalog file that would be distributed.  Verification of the Signed Catalog File Catalog SIP (GetSignedMessage): This is part of the new Catalog SIP.  It is designed to extract the signature from the Catalog file.  The GetSignedMessage will return a SIP_INDIRECT_DATA structure.  The Trust Provider (CATTrust) will call this function.  Catalog SIP (VerifyIndirectData): This is part of the new Catalog SIP.  This function will always return TRUE as the content of the PKCS#7 (the entire Catalog file) has already been verified by the trust provider (Gentrust). Verification of the Catalog file Members Trust Provider(GenTrust): GenTrust will need to be modified to accept a Catalog file and Catalog Members. This will enable the Trust List search and verification of a member contained in the Catalog file. Modification to Existing SIPs (Memory Blob): The existing SIPs (PE, Cabinet, JAVA, and Flat) need to be modified to accept a memory pointer with start and length instead of a file handle/name.  This can be done at a later date once we start site signing, or similar operations. Dependencies Certificate Trust List Project: This project is depending on the  Certificate Trust List  API set for the Creating, Signing, and Verifying of Catalog files and its members. Assumptions: The IExpress utility will IGNORE unknown sections within the CDF file. All re-basing and  Legoizing  of PE s will be done BEFORE the Catalog file is created. The Team using these features will write the Policy Module (e.g.: the Memphis Team). Technical Specifications Additions to IExpress (*.CDF) file format: The current limit on each complete line in a CDF file is 512 characters (unicode).  The following are the new sections and options for generating a Catalog file: [CatalogHeader] Name=Catalog file name ResultDir=directory to create   in (default: current) PublicVersion=0x00000001 (default: 1) EncodingType=0x00010001 (default: PKCS_7_ASN|X509_ASN) [CatalogFiles] {reference tag}=file path and name (required) {reference tag}ALTSIPID={guid} (optional) {reference tag}ATTR1={type}:{oid}:{value} (optional) {reference tag}ATTR2={type}:{oid}:{value} (optional) Where: [CatalogHeader] Defines information about the entire Catalog file. [CatalogFiles] Is the section defining each member of the Catalog file.  Each set of {file tag} s MUST be grouped together.  Each set of ATTRx s MUST be grouped together. {reference tag} Is the text reference to the file.  This can be any ASCI text string.  However, this is how it will be referenced upon verification, so, the system must be able to reproduce this tag after installation.  This name can NOT contain an   sign.  The first occurrence of this entry (physical file path and name) is REQUIRED.  All other entries for the tag are optional. ALTSIPID Is the SIP GUID that is to be used for hashing instead of the standard SIP based on file type.  This entry is OPTIONAL.  If this entry is omitted, the member will be hashed using the default SIP.  If no default installed SIP is found, the   SIP will be used. {guid} Is a text representation of an Global Unique Identifier (GUID). ATTRx Is an attribute or statement about the file or content.  There can be any number of these including NONE. {attr type} Defines what type of attribute is being added in the format 0x00000000 (text).  The following are the available values   they can be   to specify more than one: 0x10000000: This is an Authenticated Attribute (signed   included in the hash). 0x20000000: This is an Unauthenticated Attribute (unsigned   not included in the hash   not verifyable). 0x00010000: The value is represented in plain text. No conversion will be done. 0x00020000: The value is represented in base64 encoding.  Used to represent binary data. 0x00000001: This attribute is a Name-Value-Pair.  Use the   parameter for the name.  This option should have LIMITED USE.  It will be slow. 0x00000002: This attribute is referenced by an OID. {attr oid} Is the text representation of the Attribute s reference key.  It is an Object Identifier (this is a text string in  dotted  notation) or a text Name. {attr value} Is the text representation (depending on the type value) of the attribute content (value).  The EOL character(s) will determine the length. MAKECAT.EXE Parameters: The following are the command-line parameters for MAKECAT.EXE and their usage: MAKECAT.EXE [-m  -v  -e] iexpress.cdf Where: Move/merge all certs from the individual files into the Catalog file. Verbose   display all progress and error messages including minor errors. If a recoverable error occurs, FAIL and return an error to the shell.  The default is to just display the error and continue on.  If this switch is NOT set, MAKECAT.EXE will not stop the build process (e.g.: returning 0). File: This is the IExpress file that has the Catalog extensions filled in.

It will follow the new command-line format that the ISPU Group has agreed to.  CHKTRUST.EXE (verify  the Signed Catalog file and its members): This will verify both the signed Catalog file itself, as well as, its individual members. This is an existing utility   the changes include adding a command-line parameter to pass in the Catalog file name and  Member Tag  to enable the verification of the Catalog file s Members, additions to MSSIP32.DLL, and a new installable Trust Provider. CRYPT32.DLL (CryptSIPRetrieveSubjectGuid): This function will be modified to identify the Catalog file. These files will be full PKCS#7 MSSIP32.DLL (Catalog file SIP addition): The Catalog SIP will be used for both the Signing and Verifying process of the actual Catalog file. MSCAT32.DLL (CDF and Catalog File Functions): This library will contain all of the Catalog CDF Parsing and Catalog API sets. Create the Unsigned Catalog File Define/develop the CDF API Set: These APIs will be part of MSCAT32.DLL.  They are specific to parsing the IExpress (*.CDF) file for the Catalog specific entries.  These include Catalog Header information, Member information, and Attribute information.  These APIs are strictly for extracting the information from the IExpress file (*.CDF). Define/develop the Catalog API Set: These APIs will be part of MSCAT32.DLL.  They are specific to creating, in memory, the format needed by the  Certificate Trust List  APIs.  They will also take the output from the  Certificate Trust List  and store it in the Catalog file. Develop Command-line Tool (MAKECAT.EXE): This utility will use the CDF, SIP, and Catalog API sets to create the P7U.  Initial internal release (May 19th) will just have a consistent command-line parameter set, correctly parse the CDF file, and be callable from a build-script file.  This is to allow the build labs to start creating the necessary entries in the CDF file and the build scripts. Create the Signed Catalog File Catalog SIP (PutSignedMessage): This is part of the new Catalog SIP. It is designed to add the signature to the Catalog file   creating the P7S file.  The PutSignedMessage will take a SIP_INDIRECT_DATA structure and call the CryptMsgSignCTL ( Certificate Trust List  API).   This operation will add the SignerInfo structure to create the P7S file   this is the final Catalog file that would be distributed.  Verification of the Signed Catalog File Catalog SIP (GetSignedMessage): This is part of the new Catalog SIP.  It is designed to extract the signature from the Catalog file.  The GetSignedMessage will return a SIP_INDIRECT_DATA structure.  The Trust Provider (CATTrust) will call this function.  Catalog SIP (VerifyIndirectData): This is part of the new Catalog SIP.  This function will always return TRUE as the content of the PKCS#7 (the entire Catalog file) has already been verified by the trust provider (Gentrust). Verification of the Catalog file Members Trust Provider(GenTrust): GenTrust will need to be modified to accept a Catalog file and Catalog Members. This will enable the Trust List search and verification of a member contained in the Catalog file. Modification to Existing SIPs (Memory Blob): The existing SIPs (PE, Cabinet, JAVA, and Flat) need to be modified to accept a memory pointer with start and length instead of a file handle/name.  This can be done at a later date once we start site signing, or similar operations. Dependencies Certificate Trust List Project: This project is depending on the  Certificate Trust List  API set for the Creating, Signing, and Verifying of Catalog files and its members. Assumptions: The IExpress utility will IGNORE unknown sections within the CDF file. All re-basing and  Legoizing  of PE s will be done BEFORE the Catalog file is created. The Team using these features will write the Policy Module (e.g.: the Memphis Team). Technical Specifications Additions to IExpress (*.CDF) file format: The current limit on each complete line in a CDF file is 512 characters (unicode).  The following are the new sections and options for generating a Catalog file: [CatalogHeader] Name=Catalog file name ResultDir=directory to create   in (default: current) PublicVersion=0x00000001 (default: 1) EncodingType=0x00010001 (default: PKCS_7_ASN|X509_ASN) [CatalogFiles] {reference tag}=file path and name (required) {reference tag}ALTSIPID={guid} (optional) {reference tag}ATTR1={type}:{oid}:{value} (optional) {reference tag}ATTR2={type}:{oid}:{value} (optional) Where: [CatalogHeader] Defines information about the entire Catalog file. [CatalogFiles] Is the section defining each member of the Catalog file.  Each set of {file tag} s MUST be grouped together.  Each set of ATTRx s MUST be grouped together. {reference tag} Is the text reference to the file.  This can be any ASCI text string.  However, this is how it will be referenced upon verification, so, the system must be able to reproduce this tag after installation.  This name can NOT contain an   sign.  The first occurrence of this entry (physical file path and name) is REQUIRED.  All other entries for the tag are optional. ALTSIPID Is the SIP GUID that is to be used for hashing instead of the standard SIP based on file type.  This entry is OPTIONAL.  If this entry is omitted, the member will be hashed using the default SIP.  If no default installed SIP is found, the   SIP will be used. {guid} Is a text representation of an Global Unique Identifier (GUID). ATTRx Is an attribute or statement about the file or content.  There can be any number of these including NONE. {attr type} Defines what type of attribute is being added in the format 0x00000000 (text).  The following are the available values   they can be   to specify more than one: 0x10000000: This is an Authenticated Attribute (signed   included in the hash). 0x20000000: This is an Unauthenticated Attribute (unsigned   not included in the hash   not verifyable). 0x00010000: The value is represented in plain text. No conversion will be done. 0x00020000: The value is represented in base64 encoding.  Used to represent binary data. 0x00000001: This attribute is a Name-Value-Pair.  Use the   parameter for the name.  This option should have LIMITED USE.  It will be slow. 0x00000002: This attribute is referenced by an OID. {attr oid} Is the text representation of the Attribute s reference key.  It is an Object Identifier (this is a text string in  dotted  notation) or a text Name. {attr value} Is the text representation (depending on the type value) of the attribute content (value).  The EOL character(s) will determine the length. MAKECAT.EXE Parameters: The following are the command-line parameters for MAKECAT.EXE and their usage: MAKECAT.EXE [-m  -v  -e] iexpress.cdf Where: Move/merge all certs from the individual files into the Catalog file. Verbose   display all progress and error messages including minor errors. If a recoverable error occurs, FAIL and return an error to the shell.  The default is to just display the error and continue on.  If this switch is NOT set, MAKECAT.EXE will not stop the build process (e.g.: returning 0). File: This is the IExpress file that has the Catalog extensions filled in.

Note: This document is a DRAFT release of the final product design documentation.  It is meant to accompany software that is still in development.  Some of the information in this documentation may be inaccurate or may not be an accurate representation of the functionality of the final retail product.

The SIP is the layer in the Trust Model that is specific to the subject and allows the other components in the model to remain generic. For each different type of subject, there can be a different set of rules that must be followed when storing the information needed to verify the subject s integrity.  Therefore, each subject that requires a unique rule(s) must have a unique SIP. Some examples are PE Images (EXEs), CAB Images, JAVA Scripts, and Flat or End-To-End subjects.  Each of the proceeding requires different handling when it comes to storing and retrieving the signature, as well as, what pieces of the subject are actually used in the calculation or hash.  Each requires a different SIP. Tasks Performed by the SIP Hash the required areas of the subject Create indirect data information Verify indirect data information Store signatures Retrieve signatures Remove signatures The Microsoft SIP (MSSIP32.DLL) This redesign will encompass rewriting the three existing The Microsoft SIP includes SIPs utilizing thise new format and creating new SIPs for subjects that Microsoft will utilize internally for installation content and WWW download Trust Vverification.  These subjects will initially include PE Images, CAB Images, Flat (End-to-end) Images, and Catalog Files (see  Catalog Files Specifications  by Keith Vogel).. The MSSIP32.DLL is a new implementation and will contain all Microsoft SIPs.  The definition file will be included in the standard SDK (MSSIP.H). Technical Specifications Architecture Flowchart Design Requirements Motivation The concept of Catalog Files (a manifest) is the answer to the requirements of groups within Microsoft to digitally sign an entire set of file (i.e.: an entire system install).  However, the Catalog file needs a set of SIPs that will be extendable and operate very differently than the current version (MSSIP1.DLL).   This, along with a better understanding of the PKCS #7 specification and the completion of the Crypto API Version 2.0, has raised the need to redesign the current Microsoft SIP. Constraints The new SIPs must be able to load and verify subjects that were signed by previous versions. Some new SIPs have to be able to take verification information from sources other than inside the actual subject (i.e.: from the manifest).   Must only be installable from CRYPT32.DLL. All current tools must be rewritten to conform to the new functions.  In addition, new tools will be written for the Catalog file.  Architecture  General Statement MSSIP32.DLL takes advantage of an object-oriented design and is completely extendable.  Each subject type is inherited from the  most alike  subject that has already been written.  This promotes solid, well documented, reusable code. Logic Flowchart Technical Definitions Include Files and Libraries Generic/common and global SIP definitions are contained in SIPBASE.H.  This file is required to compile both applications that use SIPs and SIPs themselves. Applications that will be handling subjects included in the Microsoft SIP (MSSIP32.DLL) must include MSSIP.H to compile. Since the SIP DLL is loaded through a function call in CRYPT32.DLL, no LIBs, relevant to SIPs, are required for linking applications. To link SIPs, CRYPT32.LIB is required. Microsoft SIP Object IDs (MSSIP.H) SIP Object IDs are used to identify what subject type the WinTrust functions are to act on.  The following are the currently defined Object IDs for the Microsoft set of SIPs: // SIP v2.0 PEImage == {C689AAB8-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_PE_IMAGE                                     \             { 0xc689aab8,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 PEImageManifest == {C45CE05A-8E7F-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_PE_IMAGE_MANIFEST                            \             { 0xc45ce05a,                                           \               0x8e7f,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \                 { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }   \             } // SIP v2.0 JAVAClassImage == {C689AAB9-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_JAVACLASS_IMAGE                              \             { 0xc689aab9,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 JAVAClassImageManifest == {44F7E5F8-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_JAVACLASS_IMAGE_MANIFEST                     \             { 0x44f7e5f8,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 CabinetImage == {C689AABA-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_CABINET_IMAGE                                \             { 0xc689aaba,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 CabinetImageManifest == {44F7E5F9-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_CABINET_IMAGE_MANIFEST                       \             { 0x44f7e5f9,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 FlatImage == {DE351A42-8E59-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_FLAT_IMAGE                                   \             { 0xde351a42,                                           \               0x8e59,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 FlatImageManifest == {44F7E5F4-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_FLAT_IMAGE_MANIFEST                          \             { 0x44f7e5f4,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 ManifestImage == {DE351A43-8E59-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_MANIFEST_IMAGE                               \             { 0xde351a43,                                           \               0x8e59,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } Common Functions Definitions (SIPBASE.H) Prior to calling any of the SIP functions, all data structures must be initialized to binary zero.  After initializing, set all required members to valid values. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPLoadSip( IN const GUID *pgSubject, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN OUT SIP_DISPATCH_INFO *pSipDispatch); If successful, it fills in the pSipDispatch structure.  This function does the actual loading of the SIP s DLL and the assigning of the function pointers. BOOL CryptSIPGetInfo(IN OUT SIP_INFORMATION *pINIT); If successful, it returns the number of subjects supported and the GUIDs of the supported subjects filled in. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPAddProvider(IN SIP_ADD_NEWPROVIDER *psNewProv); If successful, adds the provider to the list of registered SIP providers. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPRemoveProvider(IN GUID *pgProv); If successful, removes the provider from the list of registered SIP providers. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPRetrieveSubjectGuid(IN OPTIONAL LPCWSTR FileName, IN OPTIONAL HANDLE hFileIn, OUT GUID *pgSubject); If successful, it returns the correct subject QUID for the file.

BOOL CryptSIPGetSignedDataMsg(    SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, DWORD *pdwEncodingType, DWORD dwIndex, IN OUT DWORD *pcbSignedDataMsg, *pbSignedDataMsg); If successful, it returns the message specified by the index.  Data specific to the subject is passed in the SIP_SUBJECTINFO structure.  The pbSignedDataMsg pointer is user allocated.  To retrieve the size of the signature, set pbSignedDataMsg to NULL. BOOL CryptSIPPutSignedDataMsg(    SIP_SUBJECTINFO  *pSubjectInfo, DWORD dwEncodingType, DWORD *pdwIndex, DWORD cbSignedDataMsg, *pbSignedDataMsg); If successful, adds a signature to the subject.  The index that the signature was stored with is returned in pdwIndex.   BOOL CryptSIPCreateIndirectData( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, IN OUT DWORD *pcbIndirectData, SIP_INDIRECT_DATA *pIndirectData); If successful, returns the pIndirectData filled with the digest algorithm, the resulting hash, and, if applicable, the encoded attribute(s).  The pIndirectData pointer is user allocated.  To retrieve the size of the indirect data, set pIndirectData to NULL. BOOL CryptSIPVerifyIndirectData( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, SIP_INDIRECT_DATA *pIndirectData); Verifies the hash of the subject passed in pIndirectData.  Returns TRUE if the subject is valid, FALSE if it is not. BOOL CryptSIPRemoveSignedDataMsg( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, DWORD dwIndex); If successful, the signature indicated by dwIndex is removed from the subject.  This function returns TRUE if a message was found to delete, FALSE if not. Common Structure Definitions (SIPBASE.H) SIP_SUBJECTINFO: DWORD cbSize: (required) Used for extensibility.  Set by the calling application to sizeof(SIP_SUBJECTINFO). GUID *pgSubjectType: (required) GUID representing the subject type.  Set by the calling application.

Set by the application.  If required by the SIP and the application does not set it, the SIP will open and close its own. CRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER DigestAlgorithm: Set to the OID of the digest algorithm for the SIP to use when creating/verifying the message. DWORD dwFlags: Flags used by the SIP.  The SIP writer defines the available flags that the application can set. DWORD dwEncodingType: The application sets this member to the message and certificate encoding type to use.  The standard for PKCS#7 is PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING. DWORD fdwCAPISettings: Policy settings from CAPI   SetReg.EXE utility.  These are defined in WINTRUST.H. The application sets this member. DWORD fdwSecuritySettings: Security settings of Internet Explorer.  The application sets this member. DWORD dwIndex: The message index of the last SIP Get function.  The SIP Get function sets this member. DWORD dwUnionChoice: Indicates what type of structure is pointed to for the ADDINFO member.

Design Changes from Previous Implementation Release Limitations Unresolved Exposures There is some exposure to the MSSIP32.DLL.  Since all SIPs are entered in the system registry under the subject type, a potential break will occur if another SIP writer creates a SIP that handles any of the same subjects as MSSIP32.DLL.  Since the functions defined receive structures that are definable by the SIP writer, these may be different.  When the application loads the SIP, and passes in the MSSIP.H defined data structure to another SIP, which registered  on top of  MSSIP32.DLL, the potential for a hard failure is high.

The SIP is the layer in the Trust Model that is specific to the subject and allows the other components in the model to remain generic. For each different type of subject, there can be a different set of rules that must be followed when storing the information needed to verify the subject s integrity.  Therefore, each subject that requires a unique rule(s) must have a unique SIP. Some examples are PE Images (EXEs), CAB Images, JAVA Scripts, and Flat or End-To-End subjects.  Each of the proceeding requires different handling when it comes to storing and retrieving the signature, as well as, what pieces of the subject are actually used in the calculation or hash.  Each requires a different SIP. Tasks Performed by the SIP Hash the required areas of the subject Create indirect data information Verify indirect data information Store signatures Retrieve signatures Remove signatures The Microsoft SIP (MSSIP32.DLL) This redesign will encompass rewriting the three existing The Microsoft SIP includes SIPs utilizing thise new format and creating new SIPs for subjects that Microsoft will utilize internally for installation content and WWW download Trust Vverification.  These subjects will initially include PE Images, CAB Images, Flat (End-to-end) Images, and Catalog Files (see  Catalog Files Specifications  by Keith Vogel).. The MSSIP32.DLL is a new implementation and will contain all Microsoft SIPs.  The definition file will be included in the standard SDK (MSSIP.H). Technical Specifications Architecture Flowchart Design Requirements Motivation The concept of Catalog Files (a manifest) is the answer to the requirements of groups within Microsoft to digitally sign an entire set of file (i.e.: an entire system install).  However, the Catalog file needs a set of SIPs that will be extendable and operate very differently than the current version (MSSIP1.DLL).   This, along with a better understanding of the PKCS #7 specification and the completion of the Crypto API Version 2.0, has raised the need to redesign the current Microsoft SIP. Constraints The new SIPs must be able to load and verify subjects that were signed by previous versions. Some new SIPs have to be able to take verification information from sources other than inside the actual subject (i.e.: from the manifest).   Must only be installable from CRYPT32.DLL. All current tools must be rewritten to conform to the new functions.  In addition, new tools will be written for the Catalog file.  Architecture  General Statement MSSIP32.DLL takes advantage of an object-oriented design and is completely extendable.  Each subject type is inherited from the  most alike  subject that has already been written.  This promotes solid, well documented, reusable code. Logic Flowchart Technical Definitions Include Files and Libraries Generic/common and global SIP definitions are contained in SIPBASE.H.  This file is required to compile both applications that use SIPs and SIPs themselves. Applications that will be handling subjects included in the Microsoft SIP (MSSIP32.DLL) must include MSSIP.H to compile. Since the SIP DLL is loaded through a function call in CRYPT32.DLL, no LIBs, relevant to SIPs, are required for linking applications. To link SIPs, CRYPT32.LIB is required. Microsoft SIP Object IDs (MSSIP.H) SIP Object IDs are used to identify what subject type the WinTrust functions are to act on.  The following are the currently defined Object IDs for the Microsoft set of SIPs: // SIP v2.0 PEImage == {C689AAB8-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_PE_IMAGE                                     \             { 0xc689aab8,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 PEImageManifest == {C45CE05A-8E7F-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_PE_IMAGE_MANIFEST                            \             { 0xc45ce05a,                                           \               0x8e7f,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \                 { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }   \             } // SIP v2.0 JAVAClassImage == {C689AAB9-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_JAVACLASS_IMAGE                              \             { 0xc689aab9,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 JAVAClassImageManifest == {44F7E5F8-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_JAVACLASS_IMAGE_MANIFEST                     \             { 0x44f7e5f8,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 CabinetImage == {C689AABA-8E78-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_CABINET_IMAGE                                \             { 0xc689aaba,                                           \               0x8e78,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 CabinetImageManifest == {44F7E5F9-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_CABINET_IMAGE_MANIFEST                       \             { 0x44f7e5f9,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 FlatImage == {DE351A42-8E59-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_FLAT_IMAGE                                   \             { 0xde351a42,                                           \               0x8e59,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 FlatImageManifest == {44F7E5F4-998C-11d0-8C5A-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_FLAT_IMAGE_MANIFEST                          \             { 0x44f7e5f4,                                           \               0x998c,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x5a, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } // SIP v2.0 ManifestImage == {DE351A43-8E59-11d0-8C47-00C04FC295EE} #define CRYPT_SUBJTYPE_MANIFEST_IMAGE                               \             { 0xde351a43,                                           \               0x8e59,                                               \               0x11d0,                                               \               { 0x8c, 0x47, 0x0, 0xc0, 0x4f, 0xc2, 0x95, 0xee }     \             } Common Functions Definitions (SIPBASE.H) Prior to calling any of the SIP functions, all data structures must be initialized to binary zero.  After initializing, set all required members to valid values. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPLoadSip( IN const GUID *pgSubject, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN OUT SIP_DISPATCH_INFO *pSipDispatch); If successful, it fills in the pSipDispatch structure.  This function does the actual loading of the SIP s DLL and the assigning of the function pointers. BOOL CryptSIPGetInfo(IN OUT SIP_INFORMATION *pINIT); If successful, it returns the number of subjects supported and the GUIDs of the supported subjects filled in. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPAddProvider(IN SIP_ADD_NEWPROVIDER *psNewProv); If successful, adds the provider to the list of registered SIP providers. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPRemoveProvider(IN GUID *pgProv); If successful, removes the provider from the list of registered SIP providers. BOOL WINAPI CryptSIPRetrieveSubjectGuid(IN OPTIONAL LPCWSTR FileName, IN OPTIONAL HANDLE hFileIn, OUT GUID *pgSubject); If successful, it returns the correct subject QUID for the file.  This is done by calling the SIP Magic Number  that was passed in. IsMyFileType  function. BOOL CryptSIPGetSignedDataMsg(    SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, DWORD *pdwEncodingType, DWORD dwIndex, IN OUT DWORD *pcbSignedDataMsg, *pbSignedDataMsg); If successful, it returns the message specified by the index.  Data specific to the subject is passed in the SIP_SUBJECTINFO structure.  The pbSignedDataMsg pointer is user allocated.  To retrieve the size of the signature, set pbSignedDataMsg to NULL. BOOL CryptSIPPutSignedDataMsg(    SIP_SUBJECTINFO  *pSubjectInfo, DWORD dwEncodingType, DWORD *pdwIndex, DWORD cbSignedDataMsg, *pbSignedDataMsg); If successful, adds a signature to the subject.  The index that the signature was stored with is returned in pdwIndex.   BOOL CryptSIPCreateIndirectData( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, IN OUT DWORD *pcbIndirectData, SIP_INDIRECT_DATA *pIndirectData); If successful, returns the pIndirectData filled with the digest algorithm, the resulting hash, and, if applicable, the encoded attribute(s).  The pIndirectData pointer is user allocated.  To retrieve the size of the indirect data, set pIndirectData to NULL. BOOL CryptSIPVerifyIndirectData( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, SIP_INDIRECT_DATA *pIndirectData); Verifies the hash of the subject passed in pIndirectData.  Returns TRUE if the subject is valid, FALSE if it is not. BOOL CryptSIPRemoveSignedDataMsg( SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo, DWORD dwIndex); If successful, the signature indicated by dwIndex is removed from the subject.  This function returns TRUE if a message was found to delete, FALSE if not. Common Structure Definitions (SIPBASE.H) SIP_SUBJECTINFO: DWORD cbSize: (required) Used for extensibility.  Set by the calling application to sizeof(SIP_SUBJECTINFO). GUID *pgSubjectType: (required) GUID representing the subject type.  Set by the calling application. HANDLE hFile: (optional) A handle to the open file of the subject, if applicable.  Set by the calling application LPCWSTR pwsFileName: (required   if file based subject) Set to the file path and name of the file representing the subject, if applicable. Set by the application LPCWSTR pwsDisplayName: (required) Set to the display name of the subject.  This will be used when displaying to the user.  Set by the application. DWORD dwIntVersion: The internal version number of the SIP.  Set by the SIP.  This member should NOT be modified by the application. HCRYPTPROV hProv: (optional) Set to an open HCRYPTPROV handle.  Set by the application.  If required by the SIP and the application does not set it, the SIP will open and close its own. CRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER DigestAlgorithm: Set to the OID of the digest algorithm for the SIP to use when creating/verifying the message. DWORD dwFlags: Flags used by the SIP.  The SIP writer defines the available flags that the application can set. DWORD dwEncodingType: The application sets this member to the message and certificate encoding type to use.  The standard for PKCS#7 is PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING. DWORD fdwCAPISettings: Policy settings from CAPI   SetReg.EXE utility.  These are defined in WINTRUST.H. The application sets this member. DWORD fdwSecuritySettings: Security settings of Internet Explorer.  The application sets this member. DWORD dwIndex: The message index of the last SIP Get function.  The SIP Get function sets this member. DWORD dwUnionChoice: Indicates what type of structure is pointed to for the ADDINFO member.  The application sets this member to one of the following: MSSIP_ADDINFO_NONE MSSIP_ADDINFO_FLAT MSSIP_ADDINFO_CATMEMBER MSSIP_ADDINFO_BLOB MSSIP_ADDINFO_NONMSSIP union struct MS_ADDINFO_FLAT_  *psFlat: struct MS_ADDINFO_CATALOGMEMBER_  *psCatMember: struct MS_ADDINFO_BLOB *psBlob; LPVOID pClientData: (optional) Data that the client can set which gets passed through to the SIP.

Design Changes from Previous Implementation Release Limitations Unresolved Exposures There is some exposure to the MSSIP32.DLL.  Since all SIPs are entered in the system registry under the subject type, a potential break will occur if another SIP writer creates a SIP that handles any of the same subjects as MSSIP32.DLL.  Since the functions defined receive structures that are definable by the SIP writer, these may be different.  When the application loads the SIP, and passes in the MSSIP.H defined data structure to another SIP, which registered  on top of  MSSIP32.DLL, the potential for a hard failure is high.

Crypt32 fills in the function pointers and returns them to the application. CRYPT32.DLL Application SIP(s) Crypt32 calls CryptSIPGetInfo() to retrieve all valid subject types.  This is a double-check. CryptSIPLoadSip() loads the correct SIP DLL as indicated in the system registryby calling the SIP IsMyFileType  function.

1.  Set up directories

        The signing batch files rely on the following directory structure:

            TOOLS:
            \cryptsdk

            WORKING DIRECTORY:
            \newworking

2.  Copy the command files to the "WORKING DIRECTORY":

        copy \\pberkman1\ispu\pkitools\prs\*.bat \newworking\.


3.  Install CryptSYS.EXE
        
        This is the Digital Security Client files.  It will prompt you 
        to re-boot.


4.  Install CrypTool.EXE

        This is the Digital Security Tools install.  Take the default 
        directory (c:\cryptsdk).



PRS SIGNING TOOLS USAGE
-----------------------

1.  Using the system with mutliple subdirectories under the "WORKING DIRECTORY" (PRS lab):

        a.  Copy the directories from \\prslab\unsigned to "WORKING DIRECTORY"
                
                xcopy \\prslab\unsigned\*.* \newworking\*.* /s /v /e /z

        b.  From the "WORKING DIRECTORY", run the command file to sign multiple 
            directories.

                cd /D \newworking
                startsgn.bat    (for verbose output, add the '-v' flag)

        c.  From the "WORKING DIRECTORY", run the command file to check multiple 
            directories.

                cd /D \newworking
                startchk.bat    (for verbose output, add the '-v' flag)


2.  Using the system to sign a single directory (for test signing):

        a.  Create a directory on your local machine.

        b.  Copy the directory from \\prslab\unsigned to your local directory

                xcopy \\prslab\unsigned\{my directory}\*.*  c:\{my directory}\*.* /s /v /e /z

        c.  From the local directory, run the command file to sign a single directory

                cd /D c:\{my directory}
                \\prslab\unsigned\tools\signfiles.bat -T

        d.  From the local directory, run the command to verify each file

                cd /D c:\{my directory}
                c:\cryptsdk\bin\chktrust file_name

Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP).  Deliverables in this project are shared by the Windows NT Security team and the Windows for Smart Cards team.   Requirements and Goals Goals of this spec Define the goals and non-goals of version 1 of the Windows for Smart Cards CSP. Define post-V1 goals of the WFSC CSP. Define requirements and a subsequent architecture for these components:  a Smart Card CSP, an underlying Card Specific module, and possible additional top-level card management API General Requirements for V1 Performance/Security/Robustness.  This component should be the best available user experience in those three categories for any smart card on the NT platform. Vendor Framework.  This CSP should be designed as a framework that vendors may use to build their own smart card CSP, reducing the burden of building a CSP from scratch, and reducing the likelihood of behavioral variations. Multiple Certificates.  Explicit provision must be made in the below architecture for the correct handling of multiple certificates on a single smart card. CSP availability (RTW) by end of Q3 2001 (9/30/2001) via Windows Update.  This is loosely tied to the availability of Whistler Client to customers. Card Management Utilities.  The necessary utilities for personalizing and un-blocking cards must be available for the first release.  WFSC Team Correct plumbing for card management utilities.  Pin handling and card customization utilities (among others) must be available for this release.  The CSP and other aspects of the architecture must address the needs of these utilities. PKCS #15.  Must be addressed by this spec, Pro/Con.  The extent to which PKCS #15 will be supported is TBD, but an attempt should be made to provide the necessary abstraction to support this card file format. Simultaneous support of multiple card layouts.  For example, V1 should be targeted to support the WFSC Version 1 format in addition to the PKCS #15 format.  This framework is also necessary for external smart card vendors who will likely have to handle this scenario.  There is a WFSC Team dependency for determining V1 card format supportability issues. Support for RSA key pairs.  Abstract Crypto API out of the smart-card-specific functionality.  Capi forms the first level, or application level, of the Smart Card CSP.  Determine if additional API s are needed at this level to fully support card usage scenarios. A Card Interface must be provided for the Capi implementation to interact with the underlying smart card in a general way.  The Card Interface forms the second level of the Smart Card CSP. Plugability of a card-specific implementation module.  The Card Interface, mentioned above, must be abstracted out of vendor- and card- specific implementation dependencies.  The Card Interface will rely on vendor-supplied card-dependant modules.  These modules will be defined by a Card Specific API, which forms the third level of the Smart Card CSP. General Non-Requirements for V1 Support for alternate Public Key technologies, such as ECC. Availability of CSP source code to vendors. On-card Certificate (Root) Store. Functional Requirements The following functional levels should be considered when specifying and implementing each version of this CSP.  Functional levels are listed below in order of highest to lowest importance   the list is apt to change as requirements evolve.  Each succeeding functional level includes the functionality of the previous levels.  The first and most common scenario to be addressed by this project is SmartCard logon, so that usage encompasses the first functional level.   At the lowest levels of the behavior to be specified in the subsequent sections of this document (especially in the Card Specific section), generic support should be included for all of the functionality described in this section.  That is, all of the following functional requirements should be supported by the Card Specific implementation layer in the first release.  The primary goals are to make the Card Specific layer general, and the CSP extensible. Level I   SmartCard Logon  This is the main target scenario for the Windows SmartCard, V1.  The basic card functionality requirements are as follows. One private key stored and pin-protected, presumably in a  default  key container.  If only one key is permitted/required, it must be of type Key Exchange. One smart card logon certificate stored.  The cert is public-readable, and pin write-protected. Level II   Multiple Certificates and Keys Multiple private keys may be stored. Each private key has an associated key container name, although there should also be a  default  key container. Each private key has some set of properties, such as the key type (Signature or Key Exchange).  Other example key properties include a key lifetime and identifying information for the associated certificate and public key. Multiple certificates may be stored, possibly with different usages.   It seems desirable to support multiple certificates per private key, although that functionality is not a base requirement for this level.  Each cert will have identifying information linking it to its private key. Level III   One Root Certificate One root certificate can be stored in the public data portion of the card.  Access to this root should be the same as access to the user s public certificate data. The root cert would ideally be the user s main trust point, such as the Microsoft Root, or the Visa Root, etc. This functionality is useful in an environment in which the user profile, and therefore the user s Root Store, is not available or not modifiable by the user.  E.g. Server auth at a kiosk? Level IV   Certificate Stores Generic certificate store functionality is available on the card. This is more useful as general card storage grows.  A user may decide to keep the entire Root Store on the card, for instance.  Level V   Data Redirection Public data portion of card includes an URL to the remainder of the user s personal data.   Interesting uses for this functionality include centralized storage for user data.  This could include the user s certificates,  lesser  private keys encrypted with a key stored on-card, address book data, etc. Crypto API Behavior Card Usage Scenarios The following card usage scenarios are based on CSP traces from performing each SmartCard user operation on a Whistler client.  The two comprehensive scenarios to be first considered are SmartCard Logon and SmartCard User Enrollment.  Each trace below consists of the Crypto API calls used in the given scenario, followed by the low-level card operation, if any, that would result from the API call.  The Crypto API calls are listed in the order they occurred, although some have been left out to avoid redundancy.   Logon See the full CSP trace of a Smart Card domain logon in the Appendix.  Required calls to support this scenario include the following.

In the below scenarios, once a card with the specified container is found, create a new HCRYPTPROV with the following data.  This is the user s context data. Context flags Container name Serial number of the corresponding card Pointer to the Card cached data Card Selection Heuristics Container Specification Levels In response to a CryptAcquireContext call, the CSP will attempt to match the container specified by the caller to a specific card/reader.  The caller can provide a container name with varying levels of specificity, shown in the following list, sorted from more-specific to less-specific requests. Reader name and Container name Reader name and Default container (NULL) Container name only Default container (NULL) only In general, for the first two cases, in which a reader name is provided, the CSP will search for the specified reader and perform the requested operation on the card inserted in that reader.  For the second two cases, in which a reader name is not provided, the CSP will perform an ordered search for a card/reader suitable for the current request, beginning with cards already known to the CSP and continuing to all card/readers currently known to the SmartCard subsystem.   For each of the above cases, the CSP will first search for a matching card in its list of cached card data.  This cache will be a list of cards and associated card state information that the CSP has encountered to-date.  In general, if a matching card is found in the cache, the card handle associated with the cache item should be tested.  This is a means to determine if the card is still in the reader, since the card may have been removed since the cache item was created.   Container Operations There are three main container operations that can be requested via CryptAcquireContext.  They are listed below. Create new container (CRYPT_NEWKEYSET) Open existing container Delete container (CRYPT_DELETEKEYSET) The heuristics used to associate a user context with a particular card and reader are based mainly on the Container Operation requested and level of Container Specification used.   The container creation operation should have the following restrictions.   No Silent context.  Key container creation must always be able to show UI, such as the Pin prompt. No overwriting existing containers.  If the specified container already exists on the chosen card, either chose another card or Fail the operation (depending on the Card Specification level). Context Flags CRYPT_SILENT   no UI may be displayed during this operation. CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET   no cached data should be used during this operation. CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT   only public data may be accessed on the card In addition to Container Operations and Container Specification, other user options must be considered during card selection, such as the above CryptAcquireContext flags.  The CRYPT_SILENT flag cannot be used with Container Operation A (create new container).  See above.   Issue:  Does the behavior of CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET still make sense?  Why would an app want to disregard all of our cached data?  That could be a big perf sacrifice. Card Selection Behavior In some of the below scenarios, the user can be prompted to insert a card.  If the user context is Silent, this operation Fails and no UI is displayed.  Otherwise, in response to the UI, the user may either insert a card, or click Cancel.  If the user Cancels, the operation Fails. For Container Specification levels I and II, the complexity of the card selection process is reduced since only the card in the named reader can be considered a match. Find the requested reader.  If it cannot be found, Fail. If there is no card in the reader, prompt the user to insert a card. For level II only, determine the name of the default container on the chosen card. For Container Operations B (open existing) and C (delete), find the specified container.  If the specified container cannot be found on this card, prompt the user to insert a card.   For Container Operation A (create new), if the specified container already exists on this card, Fail. For Container Specification levels III and IV, a broader method should be used to match an appropriate card with a user context since there may be multiple cached cards that meet the provided criteria.  readers Open Existing Container, No Reader Specified For each card already known by the CSP (the list of already-accessed cards should be cached process-wide in V1), look for the named container in the card s list of cached container names.  The container name could be a Guid or NULL, specifying the default container.  An operation should be attempted on the cached SCARDHANDLE to verify its freshness.   If the cached card has been removed and the context is SILENT, continue searching for a new matching card. If the cached card has been removed and the context is non-Silent, display UI prompting the user to insert a card.  If the user clicks Cancel, continue searching for a new matching card. If a matching card is not found in the CSP cache, call into the Smart Card subsystem.  Use SCardUIDlgSelectCard() with an appropriate callback filter to find a matching card with the requested container.  The callback provided to SCardUIDlgSelectCard should create CSP cache entries for each card enumerated.  The callback should create a new Card Cache entry for each encountered card and stick it in the CSP s global list.  In the Card Cache struct, create a new Card-Specific data struct to hold the provided SCARDHANDLE and a new Pin Cache handle. Create New Container, No Reader Specified No CRYPT_SILENT is allowed on container creation, since, at the minimum, the user must be prompted for a Pin.  Additionally, card selection UI may be necessary.  For other operations, the caller may be able to acquire a  verify  context against the default container and then make a CryptSetProvParam call to cache the user Pin for subsequent operations.  However, in the container creation case there may not already be a container against which to perform such an operation. For each card already known by the CSP, refresh the stored SCARDHANDLE and make the following checks. If the card has been removed, continue the search.   If the card is still present but already has the named container, continue the search. If the card is available, but a call to CSPQueryCardFreeSpace indicates that the card has insufficient storage for an additional key container, continue the search. Otherwise, the first available card meeting the above criteria should be used for the container creation. If a matching card is not found in the CSP cache, call into the Smart Card subsystem.  The callback used to filter enumerated cards should verify that a candidate card does not already have the named container and that CSPQueryFreeSpace indicates that the card has sufficient space for an additional container.  If no suitable card is found, display UI prompting the user to insert a card. Delete a Container If the specified container name is NULL, Fail.  This should be considered an ambiguous case since a particular reader was not specified. For each card already known by the CSP, refresh the stored SCARDHANDLE and make the following checks. If the card does not have the named container, continue the search. If the context is SILENT and the card has the named container but has been removed, Fail. If the context is non-Silent, and the card has the named container but has been removed, display UI prompting the user to insert the card. If a matching card is not found in the CSP cache, call into the Smart Card subsystem.  The callback used to filter enumerated cards should verify that a candidate card has the named container.  If the context is non-Silent and no suitable card is found, display UI prompting the user to insert a card.  Otherwise, Fail. API Definition BOOL CPAcquireContext( HCRYPTPROV *phProv, CHAR *pszContainer, DWORD dwFlags, PVTableProvStruc pVTable); phProv Initialize as a PCSP_PROV_CTX. pszContainer Callers can specify either a Fully Qualified container location or a simple container name.  The former is composed per scardcsp.doc, and includes both a reader name and a container name.  The CSP will use different semantics for locating a suitable card depending on the presence of a fully qualified container. dwFlags CRYPT_NEWKEYSET, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT, CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET, etc. pVTable Defined in wincrypt.h. typedef struct _VTableProvStruc {     DWORD                Version;     CRYPT_VERIFY_IMAGE_A FuncVerifyImage;     CRYPT_RETURN_HWND    FuncReturnhWnd;     DWORD                dwProvType;     BYTE                *pbContextInfo;     DWORD                cbContextInfo;     LPSTR                pszProvName; } VTableProvStruc,      *PVTableProvStruc; CPGenKey Key Pair Creation Verify that the caller s request is valid. Key Type   Supported key types are AT_SIGNATURE and AT_KEYEXCHANGE. Key Size   Call CSPEnumKeySizes() and verify that the specified key size is valid.  If no key size is specified, use the default key size returned by that function. Key Container   If the container specified in the user context already exists and has a key of the requested type and the context is SILENT, Fail.  Otherwise, display UI for the user to confirm the key replacement. Then call CSPCreateContainer(), specifying the key-creation flag, container name, and key size.

Handle card data caching Handle logical card file-system format Card Interface Operations The purpose of the Card Interface operations is to create a tight coupling between the Card Specific operations and the function calls to be made directly by the CSP.  The Card Interface operations should meet the following goals. Remove as much general code from the Card Specific operations as possible. Serve as a caching layer for Card data.  In general, any data that can be read off the card should be stored in the CSP process.  On subsequent requests for that data, the cached copy will be checked for freshness and then used, if possible.  The Card Interface operations will only call the Card Specific operations if cached data is not available. Enumerate Certificates  Question: Is this necessary, or should be the CSP be able to just specify container identification in the  Read Certificate  operation and have the underlying implementation locate the corresponding cert?  In that case, there is no cert enumeration, just container enumeration.  Of course, not all containers will have a cert.  And, it may be desirable to share a key between two or more certs.  Support for the latter seems to be the only reason to provide cert enumeration.   Answer:  Certificate enumeration is via CSPEnumFiles, by specifying the  UserCert  prefix in the file filter.  For the certificate (if any) belonging to the default key container, the certificate filename Guid should be the same as the Guid name of the container.  For certificates in general, the name of the corresponding key container should be included in the stored certificate data in order to support multiple certificates per key   it cannot always be true that a certificate and its key container share the same Guid name. Card Capabilities CSPQueryCapabilities DWORD CSPQueryCapabilities( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN OUT PCARD_CAPABILITIES pCardCapabilities); Key Container Key container names are specified at the Card Interface level as logical card filenames only.  That is, Fully Qualified container names, those that specify both a reader name and a container name, should not be passed to the Card Interface functions.  Only the container name portion of a fully qualified name should be passed, since each API will receive card context information.  CSPEnumContainers DWORD CSPEnumContainers( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN DWORD dwFlags, OUT LPSTR pszContainerName); CSPDeleteContainer DWORD CSPDeleteContainer( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN LPSTR pszContainerName); CSPCreateContainer DWORD CSPCreateContainer( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN DWORD dwKeySize, IN PBYTE pbKeyData); CSPGetContainerInfo DWORD CSPGetContainerInfo( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, OUT PCONTAINER_INFO pContainerInfo); CSPSubmitPin DWORD CSPSubmitPin( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszUserId, IN DATA_BLOB *Pin); CSPChangePin DWORD CSPChangePin( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszUserId, IN DATA_BLOB *CurrentPin, IN DATA_BLOB *NewPin); Public Data CSPReadFile DWORD CSPReadFile( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszFileName, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN OUT DATA_BLOB *FileContents); CSPWriteFile DWORD CSPWriteFile( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, LPSTR pszFileName, DWORD dwFlags, IN DATA_BLOB *FileContents); CSPDeleteFile DWORD CSPDeleteFile( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN LPSTR pszFileName); CSPEnumFiles DWORD CSPEnumFiles( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN OUT LPSTR pszFileName); CSPQueryFreeSpace DWORD CSPQueryFreeSpace( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN OUT PCARD_FREE_SPACE pCardFreeSpace); Cryptographic Operations Issues:  Will data padding be handled at this layer?  Some sort of RsaEncrypt function is needed   whether to simply handle data padding and dispatch to the card or to extract the requested public key from the card.  If the card supports exporting the public key, then the software CSP s could be used for RSA encrypt operations.  Public keys could then be cached with their respective container data. CSPRsaDecrypt DWORD CSPRsaDecrypt( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardCache, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN OUT PBYTE pbData); CSPQueryKeySizes DWORD CSPQueryKeySizes( IN OUT PCARD_CACHE pCardData, IN DWORD dwKeySpec,  IN DWORD dwReserved, OUT PCARD_KEY_SIZES pKeySizes); Card Interface Caching Use a  write-through  caching scheme, since the card is removable.  This will be last writer wins, since the CSP should never be required to fail write operations due to data inconsistency.  For example, Process A may have written an item X to the card since Process B last read X..  Process B may subsequently write X, which will render the cached X in Process A inconsistent.  To mitigate, the cache should have a timeout (stale) to help ensure that readers get consistent data.  It may be possible to use different timeouts for different types of data. Cache implementation is based on a set of counters stored in a well-known on-card location.  The counters will be incremented by the CSP which is doing the write operation.  The value of the counter will identify the last modification to the state of the card correctly reflected by cached data.  For simplicity, modifications will be tracked with limited granularity.  The following card areas, each as a whole, will be tracked by the cache: [ Containers | Data Files | Pins ] For example, when a process modifies any card data file, the on-card  Data Files  cache location will be updated with the current timestamp.  Any subsequent read operation from any other process for any data file will be a cache miss.  This means that the requested file will have to be read directly from the card, even if it is already correctly cached, if another on-card file has been modified since the last operation. The well-known on-card cache location should be a special data file with a pre-determined name.  Thus, cache state updates will be via CardReadFile and CardWriteFile operations using this well-known file name.  To minimize the amount of card interaction required to correctly maintain the cache state, the cache data should be stored in its own logical file without any other data.  This will allow the CSP to read and write the minimum necessary amount of data from the card to maintain the cache state.  The contents of the card cache file will be a pre-defined structure.  See the Well Known Files section, below, for the definition of this structure.  Upon card removal, card cache can safely be persisted in the process that has loaded the CSP if the card has been initialized with a serial number.  Upon card reinsertion, the already cached data may be considered fresh if the card serial number matches and the cache file indicates no change.  Issue:  Consider cross-process caching of card public data. Issue:  How should cache item enumeration be handled? Initialization As an optimization to improve response time during important operations such as Logon, certain data may be pre-read from the card and cached.  This caching will happen during calls to CryptAcquireContext.  Examples of card data to pre-read include the contents of any well-known card data files, which might contain the card serial number and default container name.  Card clients such as Winlogon should judiciously use this mechanism to pre-load a user s card data while the user is entering a PIN, for example. Data Writing Cache updates must be transaction based, and must occur in the same transaction as the immediately prior operation which is necessitating the cache update.  Currently, card translation is technically a misnomer, since the implementation is typically a mutex; however, both the cache state update and the card data update, in that order,  should occur before the mutex is released.  An example of this follows, in which the CSP is writing a general data file called Foo to the card. ++pCacheData->cGeneralData Begin Transaction dwSts = CardWriteFile(pCardData, CacheFile, 0, pCacheData)  dwSts = CardWriteFile(pCardData,  GeneralData\Foo , 0, file_contents) End Transaction Data Reading At each read request from the CSP to the card, the CacheFile will first be read from the card.  If the data area in question has not been modified (is not marked dirty), the read request will be satisfied with cached data, if possible.  If the data area in question is dirty, or the requested data is not cached, the card-read will actually take place, and its result cached.  Every function in the Card Interface layer (the CSP* functions) will perform the following steps when called.  These steps serve the purpose of ensuring cache integrity and minimizing the number of call to the Card Specific layer that must be made. Look up the cached item in the CARD_DATA structure that the CSP created for the card in question. If no such item exists, fIsCached = False. Otherwise, fIsCached = True.  Get the item s Cache Stamp, call it myCacheStamp. Begin Transaction on this SCARDHANDLE Read the Cache File using CardReadFile(). Determine which value in the cache file corresponds to the desired card data item (Containers, General Data, or Pins).  Call this currentCacheStamp. If fIsCached is False OR currentCacheStamp > myCacheStamp, then read the requested data item from the card via the appropriate Card Specific API. Otherwise, use the cached data. End Transaction on this SCARDHANDLE. If the item had to be read from the card, update the cache with the new data.  Associate currentCacheStamp with the new data. Return the requested data to the caller. Card Caching Scenarios  Goals:   Across a session, the minimum amount of data should be read from the card.  That means that no unchanged data should be read from the card twice.  Rather, unchanged data should always be retrieved from the CSP card data cache.  A session is defined as the lifetime of a process that loads the CSP and performs operations on a given card. Throughout a session, the card cache stays consistent.  That is, when the CSP is used correctly, it is not possible to read incorrect, out of date, data from the cache.  This is true even when other processes are accessing the same card. Scenario #1   Initial CryptAcquireContext for User Logon  Inputs: Named Reader Default Container Search the list of cached cards.  None are found. Enumerate cards via SCardUIDlgSelectCard().  The callback passed to this API will filter on the reader name. A CARD_DATA structure is created for this card and added to the list of cards known by the CSP.  This is the first item in the CSP s card list cache. Call CSPReadFile() for the Serial Number of this card.  This results in a call to CardReadFile() since no serial number is already cached. Call CSPReadFile() for the name of the default container of this card.  This results in a call to CardReadFile() since no container information is already cached. Call CSPGetContainerInfo() for this container.  This results in a call to CardGetContainerInfo() since the only container information currently cached is the name of the container. Scenario #2   Second CryptAcquireContext for User Logon Inputs: Named Reader Named Container Search the list of cached cards for the named container.  It is found in the cache.  Issue: Do we need to match on the reader name also?  Test the cached SCARDHANDLE to verify it s still valid.   Call CSPReadFile() for the Serial Number.  A cached value is found.  The cache read process will verify that the cached data is up to date based on the cache stamp for this item.  Issue:  We could always re-read this value from the card as a sanity check   I don t think this is necessary if we ve already matched a Guid container name. Call CSPGetContainerInfo() for the specified container name.  Cached data is found.  The cache read process will verify that the cached data is up to date. File Format  HYPERLINK "ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-15/pkcs-15v1_1.doc"  ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-15/pkcs-15v1_1.doc A fully-qualified logical file name, the type that will be based between the CSP and the Card Specific functions, consists of a logical directory name followed by a logical file name.  The pattern is  DirName/FileName.   The Card Specific layer is responsible for mapping logical file names to physical card locations. Logical Directory Names The following logical directory names are pre-defined. RootCert UserCert GeneralData Logical File Names A well-formed logical file name adheres to the following rules.   For user certificates, the logical file name is composed of a Guid, plus a few bytes of identifying information.  That comes to about 37 + 3 = 40 bytes maximum. For root certificates, the logical file name is composed of the hash of the public key.  This facilitates fast queries against user trust information. For general on-card data, the logical file name is composed of a serial number.  Common general data files, such as the master file that indicates the user default container name, will have pre-defined serial numbers. Certificates Certificates should be stored on the card in the form of the following data structure. #define CARD_CERT_FILE_CURRENT_VERSION 1 typedef struct _CARD_CERT_FILE_CONTENTS DWORD dwVersion; PBYTE pbEncodedCert DWORD cbEncodedCert; } CARD_CERT_FILE_CONTENTS, *PCARD_CERT_FILE_CONTENTS; Well Known Files Cache File The well known name of the cache file should be: GeneralData\CacheFile #define CARD_CACHE_FILE  GeneralData\CacheFile The contents of the cache file will consist only of the following structure. #define CARD_CACHE_FILE_CURRENT_VERSION 1 typedef struct _CARD_CACHE_FILE_CONTENTS DWORD dwVersion; DWORD cContainers; DWORD cGeneralData; DWORD cPins; The default ACL for the Cache File will be as follows. Everyone Read, Write  Serial Number File  The Serial Number file contains the card serial number.  The well known name should be: GeneralData\SerialNumberFile #define CARD_SERIAL_NUMBER_FILE  GeneralData\ SerialNumberFile The contents of the serial number file will consist only of the following structure.   typedef struct _CARD_SERIAL_NUMBER_FILE_CONTENTS LPSTR pszSerialNumber; The default ACL for the Serial Number file will be as follows. Everyone Read Admin Read, Write Default Container File The Default Container File contains the Guid of the card s default container.  The well known name should be: GeneralData\DefaultContainerFile #define CARD_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_FILE  GeneralData\DefaultContainerFile The contents of the default container file will consist only of the following structure. #define CARD_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_FILE_CURRENT_VERSION 1 typedef struct _CARD_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_FILE_CONTENTS DWORD dwVersion; LPSTR pszDefaultContainer; The Guid specified in the pszDefaultContainer should be formatted in such a way that it can be used directly in calls to CardGetContainerInfo(), CardRsaDecrypt(), etc.  The stored Guid also indicates the name of the default user certificate, if any, corresponding with the default key container.  To access the specified certificate file, call CardReadFile, for instance, and specify a file name composed of the returned Guid pre-pended with  UserCert\ The default ACL for the Default Container file will be as follows. Everyone Read User Read, Write Admin Read, Write  Access Control Lists The card storage areas should be configured with sensible default ACL Identities Everyone Admin Access levels Read  Write Card Storage Areas General Data Everyone Read User Read, Write Admin Read, Write Containers User Read, Write Admin Write (Issue:  Does Admin ever need Read access to user containers?) User Pin User Read, Write Admin Read, Write Admin Pin Admin Read, Write Card Removal  The Card Interface layer must be able respond robustly to notification of Card Removal from the Card Specific layer.  If the Card Specific layer detects a card removal, an appropriate status should be returned.  In response, the Card Interface should attempt to reconnect to the card.  If the reconnect is successful, the Card Specific operation should be re-attempted.  If the reconnect fails, the status notification should be propagated out of the CSP.   An SCARDHANDLE is included in the data always passed from a Card Interface to a Card Specific operation.  Calls on that handle may result in SCARD_W_REMOVED_CARD being returned to the Card Interface.  Included in the list of calls for which this case must be handled are all Card Specific operations plus Begin Transaction. In response to SCARD_W_REMOVED_CARD, the Card Interface should attempt to recover.  Reconnect and re-try, per above.  This is to check if the card has been re-inserted. If the CSP re-initialization of the card handle fails, and the current user context is not Silent, the CSP should display UI to the user prompting for the card to be inserted.   If the current user context is Silent, or if the user Cancels in the UI operation, the current CryptoAPI function should fail with SCARD_W_REMOVED_CARD. CSP User Interface Requirements The CSP may be required to interact with the user in certain situations.  The User Interface provided by this CSP has the following requirements. The CSP may display UI only if the current user context was not acquired as Silent.   The Card Specific layer should never display UI.  Only the Card Interface layer should display UI. All dialogs displayed by the CSP should have a Cancel button.  When the user presses Cancel, an appropriate error code should be returned by the affected CryptoAPI. All dialogs should be as specific as possible regarding which card, which operation, etc.   Scenarios If the user context is not Silent, the CSP may display UI only in the following situations. If card initialization fails, prompt the user to insert the requested card. If a CryptoAPI operation is requested on a user context associated with a card other than the one currently inserted, prompt the user to insert the requested card. When a Card Specific operation makes a Pin Cache request, the cached pin may be incorrect for the current operation.  The status SCARD_W_WRONG_CHV should be returned to the Card Interface.  In response, prompt the user to enter the correct pin.  Then update the Pin Cache and re-attempt the Card Specific operation. Implementation If possible, cards should be given friendly names which can be included in the UI message text.  The friendly name could be delivered during card personalization and could be relatively generic, such as  NTDev domain user logon,  etc.  Otherwise, consider displaying the card serial number, although it may be difficult for users to associate a given serial number with the actual card. Since cryptographic signing of CSP packages is still required for export regulation, CSP resource strings should be delivered in a separate package from the CSP itself.  This is per requirements of the International Build Labs to not localize PRS-signed binaries.  Currently, the Microsoft software CSP s use crypt32.dll as the delivery vehicle for localized strings.  That method is not suitable since the SmartCard CSP is not in sync with the crypt32 ship schedule and modifications to crypt32 are risky.  As a result, the SmartCard CSP should be delivered as two dll Two separate dialog boxes are required for this CSP.  Descriptions of each follow. Card Insertion Dialog This dialog will consist of a title bar, text box, and Cancel button. Pin Dialog This dialog will consist of a title bar, text box, edit box, OK button, and Cancel button. Card Specific Module Requirements Must implement a standardized set of macro-level operations Map logical card file-system objects to physical card locations.   Each Card Specific operation should implement a single, atomic transaction. Implement  best behavior  not responsible for reproducing the incorrect behavior of existing platforms. Card Specific Operations Card Capabilities It will be necessary for the card CSP to the support multiple variations of specific cards and card modules.  To best take advantage of the capabilities of a given card, the card specific module should provide an API that the CSP can use to query the full set of functionality provided by the card.  Examples of card capabilities include compression algorithms and a guarantee of file integrity via checksum.  If any functionality required by the CSP is provided by the card, such as compression, the CSP should always rely on the card implementation.  Otherwise, the CSP will fall back to its own implementation of this functionality. #define CARD_CAPABILITIES_CURRENT_VERSION 1 typedef struct _CARD_CAPABILITIES DWORD dwVersion; BOOL fCompression; BOOL fFileChecksum; } CARD_CAPABILITIES, *PCARD_CAPABILITIES; CardQueryCapabilities DWORD CardQueryCapabilities( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN OUT PCARD_CAPABILITIES pCardCapabilities); Input: Version number should be set in pCardCapabilities Output: Status Filled-in pCardCapabilities struct  Purpose: Query the card and card-specific module combination for the functionality provided at this level, such as compression and file checksums. Key Container Enumerate Delete Create with Key Generate Create with Key Import In contrast to the behavior of Microsoft s Windows 2000-era software CSP s, only one key pair per container will be supported.  Associated with each key will be a key usage, Signature or Key Exchange.   Open Issue: Also associated with each key container should be identifying information about the corresponding Certificate on the card (logical information about where to find the cert data).  Not all containers will have a corresponding cert.  This pre-supposes that multiple certs per key won t be supported. CardEnumContainers DWORD CardEnumContainers( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwFlags, OUT LPSTR pszContainerName); Input: First | Next Output: Status Guid name of current key container Purpose: In successive calls, list the names of all key containers present on the card.  Status should indicate failure if the end of the enumeration is reached and the contents of the output buffer have not changed. CardDeleteContainer DWORD CardDeleteContainer( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN LPSTR pszContainerName); Input: Output: Status Purpose: Delete the key container named by the Guid.  Status should indicate success if the container existed and was successfully deleted.  Otherwise, status should indicate that container didn t exist, or delete failed for specific reason, or etc. CardCreateContainer DWORD CardCreateContainer( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN DWORD dwKeySize, IN PBYTE pbKeyData); Input: KeyGen | KeyImport If KeyGen, a key-type and size must also be supplied. If KeyImport, the key data must also be supplied. Output: Status Purpose: Create a new key container named Guid.  The new container will always contain a valid key if the call succeeds.  The two methods of creating a new container are via random key generation and importation of existing key data. Issue:  What should be the blob format for importing RSA keys?  The BSafe private-blob format probably isn t public, but there may be a PKCS for this. Issue: What if an app attempts to create a Cert with key-exchange key usage using the default container, when the default container already has a Signature key?  This would fail in the one-key model since the container is already  full,  and the current key doesn t have the correct usage.  Correct behavior might be to redirect to a new container. CardGetContainerInfo DWORD CardGetContainerInfo( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, IN OUT PCONTAINER_INFO pContainerInfo); Input: Output: Status Purpose: Query the specified key container for additional information about the key it contains, such as its Key Type (Signature or Key Exchange).  The behavior in V1 should be always to return all available container info; however, in future versions it may be desirable to narrow the request to a specific piece of container data to limit the amount of data to be transferred. There will be at least a 1:1 relationship between the information specified during CardCreateContainer and the information able to be queried by this call.  That is, there is no container data accessible via CardGetContainerInfo that was not specified during CardCreateContainer. CardSubmitPin DWORD CardSubmitPin( IN PCARD_INFO pCardInfo, IN LPSTR pszUserId, IN DATA_BLOB *Pin); Input: UserId Output: Status Purpose: Using the supplied Pin, authenticate the specified user (User or Admin) to access card private data, such as user key containers.  The use of this call will be regulated by the Pin Cache library. CardChangePin DWORD CardChangePin( IN PCARD_INFO pCardInfo, IN LPSTR pszUserId, IN DATA_BLOB *CurrentPin, IN DATA_BLOB *NewPin); Input: UserId CurrentPin NewPin Output: Status Purpose: Change the Pin for the specified user.  In the CSP, this call will only be made via the Pin Cache library. CardUnblockPin DWORD CardUnblockPin( IN PCARD_INFO pCardInfo, IN DATA_BLOB *Pin); Input: Output: Status Purpose: Using the supplied Pin, unblock a card which has been locked due to an incorrect user pin having been supplied more than the maximum number of allowed times.  If the card was not blocked, or if the unblock failed, the Status should specify these cases. Public Data Either in addition or as an alternative to Certificate management functionality, there should be interfaces that emulate generic file storage on the card.  This storage could be used for credentials, certificates, etc.   Is it necessary to provide methods for ACL ing?  Cert data is public, so no additional security is needed.  If credentials are going to be stored in the public data portions of the card, is possession of the card itself sufficient security, rather than exposing functionality for securing portions of the card s public data? Certificate management, for example, requires Enumerate, Delete, and Create functionality. This interface should have similar look and feel to simplified versions of NT CreateFile, ReadFile, and WriteFile.  A file path parameter should correspond to the physical layout of the card (it is up to the Card Interface Layer, above, to map the logical locations from the CSP to physical card locations).  The purpose of this interface is to abstract the card as a general, generic file system to be managed by the CSP. An example of how the CSP will manage public card data using CreateFile semantics is via a master file stored on the card at a well-known location.  This master file will serve as a directory of the objects that the CSP has stored in the card file-system.  This would allow the CSP to lookup the file names associated with the user certificates and other data stored on the card.  The contents of the Certificate file objects would be determined by the CSP.  Included in the Certificate data would be information for locating its associated key container.  This approach has some trade-offs, however, since additional card-reads will be necessary to first request the master file and then to request the actual data file in question (such as the default user certificate).   On the plus side, the use of a master file gives the CSP a great deal of control over how general card data is stored and accessed.  This may better facilitate versioning of the card storage format and allow cards to be more versatile.  For instance, rather than relying on the card to keep track of the name of the default user container, that information could simply be stored in a well-known general file.  As an optimization, the CSP could immediately read and cache the default file from the card at Dll load time.   CardReadFile DWORD CardReadFile( IN PCARD_INFO pCardInfo, IN LPSTR pszFileName, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN OUT DATA_BLOB *FileContents); Input: LogicalFileName Buffer BufferLength Output: Status File Contents File Contents Length Purpose: Read the entire file specified by LogicalFileName into the user supplied buffer.  The location specified by LogicalFileName should be fully-qualified and well formed per Section 4.3 FileFormat, above. If the data-pointer member of the FileContents parameter is set to NULL, the function will place the size of the specified file in the FileContents data-size member.  If the size of the file is greater than the FileContents data-size member, no data will be copied into the caller buffer and the data-size member will be set to the size of the file.  If the size of the file is less than the FileContents data-size member, the file will be copied into the caller buffer and the data-size member will be set to the size of the file. CardWriteFile  DWORD CardWriteFile( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, LPSTR pszFileName, DWORD dwFlags, IN DATA_BLOB *FileContents); Input: LogicalFileName File Contents File Contents Length Flags Output: Status Purpose: Depending on Flags value, will create the file if it doesn t exist. CardDeleteFile DWORD CardDeleteFile( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN LPSTR pszFileName); Input: LogicalFileName Output: Status Purpose: Delete the specified file.  If the file doesn t exist, the returned Status should indicate if the file did not exist.  CardEnumFiles DWORD CardEnumFiles( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwFlags, IN OUT LPSTR pszFileName); Input: EnumFirst | EnumNext If EnumFirst, a directory prefix; see below. Output: LogicalFileName Purpose: For the ENUM_FIRST case, the LogicalFileName parameter can contain a directory prefix, restricting the scope of the enumeration. CardQueryFreeSpace DWORD CardQueryFreeSpace( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwReserved, OUT PBYTE pbFreeSpaceInfo); Input: Output: Status Card space information (e.g. number of bytes left, number of available key containers) Purpose: Determine the amount of available card storage space.  This may be an approximate value in some cases.  Examples of the use of this information are determining if a new key container can be created and determining if the card has sufficient storage for a given certificate.  The former will be used in calls to CryptAcquireContext CRYPT_NEWKEYSET to determine if the call should succeed, even though the key itself won t be created until CryptGenKey is called. Cryptographic Operations Sign Data / RSA Decrypt  The remainder of cryptographic functionality should come from the software CSP s for performance.   CardRsaDecrypt DWORD CardRsaDecrypt( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN LPSTR pszContainerName, IN DWORD dwReserved, IN OUT PBYTE pbData); Input: Ciphertext Output: Status Plaintext Purpose: The input data for RSA Decryption should be padded by the CSP based on the format requested by the caller (e.g. PKCS #1).  Therefore, the data passed to and from CardRsaDecrypt will always be equal in length to the public modulus.  This frees the card specific layer from needing to implement various padding schemes.  The CSP will validate the padding in the plaintext, so this API should succeed except in the case of hardware error. CardQueryKeySizes DWORD CardQueryKeySizes( IN PCARD_DATA pCardData, IN DWORD dwKeySpec,  IN DWORD dwReserved, OUT PCARD_KEY_SIZES pKeySizes); Input: AT_SIGNATURE | AT_KEYEXCHANGE Output: Status Supported key sizes for the specified algorithm type. Purpose: Determine the public key sizes supported by the card in use.   Issue:  Are all cards required to support both Signature and Key Exchange key types?  Should the card specific module even care what   the key is, or does it just need to know the length?  It seems that the CSP should be solely responsible for key types. Data Structures A common data structure will be used by all of the above Card Specific functions.  See the attached header for the definition of the CARD_DATA structure. Implementation Card Specific Modules can be implemented as a Provider Dll.   Appendix A   CSP Traces Smart Card Logon This CSP trace is from a Windows Whistler machine, build 2441.

Set Of Policy (RSoP) tool. The next section describes the method providers and the following section describes the schema. WMI Provider Methods Planning Mode In the planning or what-will-happen mode the RSoP UI calls the methods of a WMI method provider to create the resultant policy data. The name of the method provider object is RsopPlanningModeProvider and it has two  methods. RsopCreateSession generates the planning mode data, and RsopDeleteSession deletes the planning mode data when it is no longer needed by the UI. The declaration of RsopCreateSession is, void RsopCreateSession( [in]  uint32 flags,                         [in]  string computerName,                          [in]  string computerSOM,                         [in]  string computerSecurityGroups[],                          [in]  string userName,                         [in]  string userSOM,                         [in]  string userSecurityGroups,                         [in]  string site,                         [in]  string GPOFilters[],                         [out] string nameSpace,                         [out] uint32 hResult,                         [out] uint32 ExtendedInfo ) Where,  flags Are a combination of the following values: RSoP_NoGPOFilter when this flag is used, the unfiltered list of GPOs is returned. The default is to filter the list of GPOs based on ACLs and other parameters. computerName is the name of the target computer account name. This can be null if just policy data for a user needs to be generated. computerSOM is the proposed fully qualified distinguished name of the new scope of management, i.e. domain or OU of the target computer. If this is null it means that the current domain or OU of the computer account is to be used. computerSecurityGroups is the proposed list of security groups to which the target computer belongs. If this is null, the current list of security groups for the target computer is obtained from the DC. If ComputerName is also not specified, Default Security Groups  authenticated Users  and  Everyone  is added. userName, userSOM,  and userSecurityGroups are the target user counterparts of computerName, computerSOM and computerSecurityGroups respectively. site is the site name of the target computer. GPOFilters is the list of WQL filter ids whose query evaluates to true. nameSpace is an output parameter, which identifies the namespace under which the RSoP data for this planning mode session is stored. The computer data will be stored under nameSpace\Computer and the user data will be stored under nameSpace\User. There is no loopback mode configuration. All policy data is generated in the normal mode alone. hResult is an HRESULT output parameter that indicates whether the method succeeded or failed. ExtendedInfo is meant to return more info to the caller.  Currently it returns the following in case of AccessDenied errors RSOP_USER_ACCESS_DENIED RSOP_COMPUTER_ACCESS_DENIED The declaration of RsopDeleteSession is, void RsopDeleteSession( [in]  string nameSpace                         [out] uint32 hResult ) Where,  nameSpace is the output parameter that was returned in the call to RsopCreateSession.  hResult is an HRESULT output parameter that indicates whether the method succeeded or failed. The RSoP UI tool needs to call CoInitializeSecurity before calling the provider methods so to allow the implementation of the provider to impersonate the client when needed.  This call can be done as,     CoInitializeSecurity( NULL, -1, NULL, NULL,                           RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CALL,                           RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE,                           NULL, 0, 0); The call to RsopCreateSession may take a long time, potentially minutes, to generate the RSoP data for both computer and  machine. Hence it is desirable to provide to the user an indication of progress and to also allow the user to cancel the method. WMI provides an asynchronous mode of method calling with the ExecMethodAsync method of IWbemServices. The RSoP UI needs to supply an implementation of the IWbemObjectSink interface to the ExecAsyncMethod method. While RsopCreateSession is executing it sends updates of the output parameters: numerator and denominator through IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method. When RsopCreateSession has finished executing it calls IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus to set the final status. The RSoP UI can cancel the execution midway with the IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall  method. Diagnostic Mode In the diagnostic or what-happened mode the RSoP UI calls the methods of a WMI method provider to snapshot the diagnostic policy data that is already present on the machine. The diagnostic data on a machine is periodically refreshed by the winlogon group policy engine. Snapshotting the data allows the UI to display the data without the data getting overwritten or deleted as part of a policy refresh. The name of the method provider object is RsopDiagnosticModeProvider and it has three  methods. RsopCreateSession snapshots the diagnostic mode data, and RsopDeleteSession deletes the snapshot data when it is no longer needed by the UI.  RsopEnumerateUsers returns the list of users whose diagnostic mode data is available for taking snapshots.  The declaration of RsopCreateSession is void RsopCreateSession( [in] flags,                         [in] string userSid,                               [out] string nameSpace,                              [out] uint32 hResult,                              [out] uint32 ExtendedInfo ) Where,  Flags  are reserved. Must be 0. UserSid is the Sid of the user we are interested in. If it is Null, the Sid of the current thread is used. nameSpace is an output parameter, which identifies the namespace under which the RSoP data for this diagnostic mode session is stored. The computer data will be stored under nameSpace\Computer and the user data will be stored under nameSpace\User\{Sid}. hResult is an HRESULT output parameter that indicates whether the method succeeded or failed. ExtendedInfo is meant to return more info to the caller.  Currently it returns the following in case of AccessDenied errors RSOP_USER_ACCESS_DENIED RSOP_COMPUTER_ACCESS_DENIED The declaration of RsopDeleteSession is, void RsopDeleteSession( [in]  string nameSpace                         [out] uint32 hResult ) Where,  nameSpace is the output parameter that was returned in the call to RsopCreateSession.  hResult is an HRESULT output parameter that indicates whether the method succeeded or failed. The declaration of RsopEnumerateUsers is, void RsopEnumerateUsers([out] string userSids[]                         [out] uint32 hResult ) Where,  UserSids is the list of user s on the computer whose diagnostic mode data is available for snapshotting. hResult is an HRESULT output parameter that indicates whether the method succeeded or failed. Before calling the methods of RsopDiagnosticModeProvider, the RSoP UI needs to call CoInitializeSecurity as explained in the planning mode section above. Details When the Policy processing is done the diagnostic mode data is logged.  The location where the data is logged under various scenarios is described below For machine the Data is logged under   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\root\\rsop\\Computer"  \\.\root\rsop\Computer For a User the Data is logged under   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\root\\rsop\\user\\{UserSid"  \\.\root\rsop\user\{UserSid This data can later on be enumerated and snapshot using the methods in the Snapshot provider as described above.  The snapshot provider creates a snapshot of the Data under temporary namespaces (these are generated dynamically) under the   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\root\\rsop"  \\.\root\rsop  namespace. These namespaces get Garbage Collected and can be deleted using the methods of Snapshot Provider. For machine the Data is copied from   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\root\\rsop\\Computer"  \\.\root\rsop\Computer  to \\.\root\rsop\<TempNameSpace>\Computer. For a User the Data is logged under   HYPERLINK "\\\\.\\root\\rsop\\user\\UserSid"  \\.\root\rsop\user\UserSid \\.\root\rsop\<TempNameSpace>\User\{UserSid}. Error Logging As part of the RSOP Logging an instance of RSOP_ExtensionStatus (described later on the document) is logged by the policy Engine at the beginning of processing to mark the RSOP data as dirty. In the rare case, when the policy Engine fails to log this instance, policy processing is immediately aborted with an appropriate error in the Eventlog.  Before calling into each of Client-Side-Extension a per-extension instance of RSOP_ExtensionStatus is also logged marking the extension specific data as dirty. Once the Client Side Extension finishes processing, it notifies the Group Policy Engine as to the status of the data logged. Depending on this notification, the Group Policy Engine marks the per-extension specific data to be dirty or clean. At the end of the processing, if the Group Policy Engine has logged all the data that it is required to log correctly, it marks its data to be clean. RSoP Classes This sections describes the various classes of Resultant Set Of Policy (RSoP) infrastructure. In the first part, a diagram is presented which illustrates all the classes in the schema as well as the relationships between the classes. Additionally, only the most relevant data members of each class are depicted. For a complete list of the class members, refer to the second part of this document.

This is valid in planning mode only General Schema use: The schema for managed applications requires further explanation because each instance of this class may have a relationship to other instances.  Also, some of the RSoP information does not refer to actual applications applied to a target, but to effects of those settings, such as application uninstalls or the Add / Remove Programs view of applications. Thus, we must discuss the relationships that may exist between instances as well as other idiosyncrasies of this class. RSoP Instance types The instances of Application Management classes in the RSoP namespace fall into 3 classes: Applied applications: These are deployed applications that have been applied to the target or were considered for application to the target.  This means that the application is visible for use by the target.  This may be interpreted as having the application installed for the target.  These instances can be identified by the  Applied  value for the  Entrytype property. ARP applications: These are instances of applications that appear in the Add / Remove Programs list or were considered for that list but  lost out  to the winning list items.  These are identified by the  ARP List Item  value of the Entrytype property. Removed applications: These are applications that have been removed from the resultant set of policies.  Each instance may be identified by the  Removed Application  value for the Entrytype property.  Only applications that were actually removed are listed   there is no notion of  conflict  for this type of instance. It is quite possible for one deployed application to fall into more than one class.  For example, if an application was applied to the machine through the policy engine at logon, that application will appear in the RSoP data.  Later, when the user executed the ARP application, a list of applications is generated, and at that time  ARP List Item  instances are generated in the namespace alongside the instances for  applied  applications. applied  applications instances are analogous to kindsthe types of instances logged by all the other policy extensions.  We will now discuss the  ARP List Item  and  Removed Application  sets that are specific to Application Management policy. ARP List Item This set of instances is the set of applications that were displayed or were considered for display the last time the user ran the ARP applet. Every time the user runs ARP, all instances of this type are deleted from the user s namespace and then the namespace is populated with new instances corresponding to the applications shown in ARP.  Every refresh of the list by the user will also cause this erase / repopulate sequence to occur. This behavior has the following consequences: There will be no  ARP List Item  instances logged for machine policy since ARP is not applicable to machine policy. There will be no  ARP List Item  instances logged for a user that has never run ARP on that machine. There will only be ARP instances from the last time ARP was run   results from a previous ARP invocation are lost every time ARP is executed / refreshed. The ARP List Item feature was added because administrators were interested in seeviewing the resultant set of ARP list items. Removed Applications Despite the fact that RSoP is meant to show only the  current state  of policy applied to a target, software uninstalls performed by Application Management Policy are of enough interest to administrators that an exception was made to include data about a setting that was un-applied (i.e. an application that was uninstalled or unmanaged) with the resultant set.  These instances have the following properties: Every time an application is uninstalled, the existing  Applied  instance for that application is changed to a  Removed Application  entry, and various uninstall-related fields are set for that instance. Every time application management policy is refreshed due to a change in policy, all entries of this type are deleted before the resultant set is logged. These instances do not have  conflicts. This has the following consequences Removed application instances only exist as long as policy has not changed   this was done to avoid an unbounded number of removed application instances piling up in the namespace. The existence of a removed application instance has no effect on instances of that same application logged as ARP List Items   these two may coexist in the namespace. Conflicts The RSOP_ApplicationManagementPolicySetting classis class models the settings conflicts that may occur with software installation.  Software Installation differs from other types of policies in the following way: An individual policy setting (i.e. a deployed application) may conflict with more than one other policy setting. Settings may conflict for different reasons.  For example, but upgrade relationships and, language matching, or product conflicts mayare all reasons that cause one application tomay  defeat  another.  component of RSoP is much more complex for Application Management than for other policies.  For other types of policy, the answer to   a setting was applied is implicitly  because the admin said so.   For Application Management,   depends upon the local state of the machine, as well as the relationship of a setting (deployed application) to other settings. The other RSoP classes do not have to deal with these issues.  They can model conflicts as a simple list ordered by a precedence.  A more general graph or tree is required to model Application Management policy.  To this end, the ConflictGroupId property is introduced for the Application Management class: Conflicts may occur for ARP List Item instances or Applied Application instances.  All such instances with precedence 1 (winning) will have different values for ConflictGroupId. For any deployed software that conflicted with a winning instance, there will be an instance of that application in the RSoP namespace and that instance will have the ConflictGroupId of the winning application.As with the other classes, all settings that conflict with each other have the same Id property.  For application management, Tthis has the following consequences: winning  (precedence = 1) application may only appear once for applications of the same entry type (ARP List Item or Applied Application). losing  application may appear more than once in the set of applications for the same entry type, once for each winning application with which it conflicts. If a  losing  application appears more than once in the set of applications for the same entry type, none of these instances may have the same ConflictGroupId. losing  application may appear only once in the set of applications that have the same ConflictGroupId. Precedence For policy types other than Application Management, the RSoP precedence property allows an application to be logged as being defeated by either one or zero instances.  For Application Management,  an application may be defeated by more than one other instance.  This is why the notion of ConflictGroupId was introduced.  To model the fact that an application may be defeated by more than one application, we state that precedence is only defined in the context of a particular ConflictGroupId.  If we did not make this statement, we would have to allow an instance to have multiple precedences.  We are in essence getting away with this because for each application by which a particular application is defeated, that application will have an instance, and they will be exactly the same in terms of properties except that each has a different ConflictGroupId.  They may also each have a different precedence depending on the manner in which it conflicted with the  winning  application.  Thus, the ConflictGroupId property allows us to model the fact that an application may be defeated by more than one application and that it may have a different precedence in relationship to each winner. Precedence, then, makes sense only in the context of one ConflictGroupId.  However, even with in the set of applications for a particular ConflictGroupId, we still have problems.  To see this, we must re-state a key property of precedence: If an instance with precedence n is removed, all instances with precedence > n have their precedence decreased by 1.  In particular, if n = 1, then the instance of precedence 2 changes its precedence to 1.  The meaning of this is that the setting represented by the instance formerly of precedence 1 is now applied to the target. For application management, the above statement is qualified by saying that all such instances have the same ConflictGroupId.To interpret the meaning of precedence for the RSOP_ApplicationManagementPolicySetting class, the following definition should be used: an application A is assigned a lower precedence value than another application B if A the presence of A is preventing B from being applied to the target. With this definition, let us consider what happens when application A, which is configured to upgrade both applications B and C, is applied, assuming all such applications are  assigned.  B & C will clearly   to A, and from above, we know that a losing application has the ConflictGroupIId of the application with precedence 1.  This is A in this case, so see that A,B & C will have the same ConflictGroupId.  Now, what is the precedence for these applications?  Clearly A is 1, but is B or C #2?  This ranking issue can be solved easily if we allow the concept of   in that case, both B and C would be of rank 2.  If we go back to the precedence definition above, this solution works, because if A is removed, B & C both get a precedence 1, and as the definition states, these instances of precedence 1indicate that applications B & C should now be applied (installed) to the target.  This is indeed consistent with the behavior of Application Management Policy. We summarize these precedence features below: The precedence property for an application instance is only relevant for ranking among instances with the same ConflictGroupId. An instance may appear multiple times with different precedences for instances of the same entry type.  are allowed for the precedence (rank) within a set of instances with the same ConflictGroupId. A set of instances will be tied if and only if all instances in the set were defeated by the same precedence 1 instance (i.e. they have the same ConflictGroupId) and that in the event that all instances with a precedence value less than the instances in the set were un-applied, all the instances in the set would have precedence 1 and thus be applied.were no longer prevented from being applied. Precedence Reason The non-application management policy types have exactly 1 type of conflict   for example, if a registry setting of a particular name exists in two different GPO s, the setting from the  closest  GPO to the target wins.  For registry settings, this is the only way that a conflict can occur, and this is true of the other settings as well.  This has the following consequences for these policy types: The relationship between settings that conflict is discernible without the need for a property specific to this need in the schema because for these policy types, there is only one way in which a conflict can occur. The administrator can easily infer what settings should be modified and how they should be modified in order to alter the precedence of a particular setting based strictly on the precedence. For application management policy, there are several other ways in which a conflict may occur other than the same identifier existing in two different GPO An upgrade relationship may cause one application to defeat another If there are applications with the same Product Id in a GPO, one will defeat the other. If there are applications of different language with the same Product  Id in a GPO, one will defeat the other. Without a property indicating the reason for a setting s precedence, there is no way, unlike the other policy types, to determine why a setting is ranked lower than another.  Thus, we introduce the Precedence reason property.  Although it was described earlier along with the other properties in the schema, we re-state its use here in the context of our precedence discussion: The PrecedenceReason property gives the reason that an instance has a lower precedence value than instances that have the next highest value.  It can be interpreted as the reason for which an application lost out to another. Eligibility In logging mode, the application management client-side extension does not log data concerning every application deployed in the directory.  It only logs data for those applications that might be relevant to the target, primarily because these are the only applications it considers for application to the target.  The Eligibility property describes the reason that the client-side extension included the application in RSoP data. In planning mode, where end-user performance is not at issue, the client-side extension attempts to generate a full picture of the relationship between applications, and thus it considers that it might otherwise ignore.  These applications are marked  Conditional,  meaning that such applications would only be logged in logging mode if they were actually applied to the machine. Error Information RSoP classes may optionally log errors for each setting that failed to apply using the RSOP_PolicySettingStatus class. The RSOP_ApplicationManagmentPolicySetting does log this information for any application that fails to apply (install) or uninstall, i.e. any RSOP_ApplicationManagementPolicySetting instance with an  Applied Removed  EntryType property may have an associated RSOP_PolicySettingStatus instance.  RSOP_PolicySettingStatus instances are not logged by the application management CSE if the application is applied or uninstalled successfully.

This schema version number consists of 2 parts. The Version Numbers should always be incremented. Major Version Number HiWord part of the version Number.  If a schema change is made that cannot handle possible existing Instances using the Classes defined already higher version number should be incremented.  This means that During NT Setup all the Namespaces will be deleted. Mof will be recompiled. Group Policy Engine will relog all data and invoke all CSEs to relog all data. Minor Version Number LoWord part of the version Number. All the Classes will be compiled. These Classes will be copied over to existing user and Machine Namespaces. Note that extensions and Client Side Extensions will not be  called to relog the data. The Current Schema s version number is stored at root\rsop\computer rsop_session's schema version number.

PASSPORT EVENT LIBRARY README.txt  9/10/98
------------------------------------------

This library defines an interface class and a single implementation to 
synchronously report events in the calling program.  Currently there is 
only one implementation:  NT Events or Alerts.  In the future there may 
be other implementations for SNMP traps, etc.



For the NT Events implemetation there are two Dlls that you must use to 
report events. Building in the $(PASSDEV)/common/AlertLibrary directory 
creates a generic alert Dll, which the calling program must (static or 
dynamic) link with in order to report events.  A second Dll, in either 
the 'hubAlerts' or 'brokerAlerts' subdirectories of 
$(PASSDEV)/common/AlertLibrary defines the symbols and strings for the 
events themselves.  Both the calling program and the EventViewer 
application must link with this Dll.


Initial Setup:
--------------
Build (type "build -c") the Alert Library in 
$(PASSDEV)/common/AlertLibrary and in relevant subdirectory (hubAlert or 
brokerAlert) build the Alert Definition Dll.  


Registry Setup:
--------------
Although not is not absolutely necesssary to modify your local machine's 
registry to report events -- you will still be able to see the events 
with the event viewer, but not their string explanations.  It should be 
noted that the Alert library does modify the registry, but only when run 
from a user.  When used in an NT service (like the hub or broker) the 
Alert Dll does not have permission to modify the registry.  Therefore, 
in the directory where the Alert definition Dll lives (most likely 
$(PASSDEV)/sdk/lib/i386) run the command:

'regsvr32 <name>Alerts.dll' 

where <name> is hub or broker.  You should see the respective key added 
to the "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application" 
registry location.


Class Interface Usage:
----------------------
Here is a description (minus the error checking)

#include  "<testAlerts.h"
#include  "PassportAlertInterface.h"


	// load the Alert library
	HINSTANCE instanceDLL = LoadLibrary(LIBNAME);

	// get the appropriate getObject Function out of the Dll
	// and call it, returning the implementation class
	PassportAlertInterface *alert = NULL;
	CREATEOBJECT getObj = NULL;

	getObj = (CREATEOBJECT)GetProcAddress(instanceDLL, 
			"CreatePassportAlertObject");

	alert = (PassportAlertInterface *) (*getObj)
				(PassportAlertInterface::EVENT_TYPE);

	// call the AlertLibraryclass!
	alert->initLog(LOGNAME);
	alert->report(PassportAlertInterface::ERROR_TYPE, 
			EVMSG_MEMORY1);
	alert->closeLog();

	FreeLibrary(instanceDLL);

Adding your own events:
-----------------------
You need to modify the <name>Alerts.mc file in the Alert definition Dll 
directory.  Follow the pattern where all entries except the last end in 
a ".".  Compile the .mc file with mc.exe utility (found in you VC++ bin 
directory).  Run the command

'mc.exe <name>Alerts.mc'

You will need to first check out the the <name>Alerts.h and 
<name>Alert.rc files in order to make them writable.  After you've 
compiled the message file, you need o re-build the Dll.  This is a hack, 
but you must first make the <name>Alerts.h and <name>Alert.rc non-
writable for he build command to work.

PASSPORT PERFORMANCE LIBRARY README.txt  9/10/98
------------------------------------------------
This library defines an interface class and a single implementation to 
synchronously set performance counters in a application.  Currently 
there is only one implementation:  NT Performance Monitor.  In the 
future there may be other implementations for SNMP traps, etc.

A performance counter is a single DWORD, that an application may 
increment, decrement or set.  An application may define many performance 
counters.  Counters are communicated out-of-process to the perfmon 
application via a memory-mapped files.  Counters are lightweight:  for 
the application, incrementing a counter is just modifiying a DWORD in a 
section of shared memory.  Examples of performance counters are numbers 
of items in a cache, number of failed authentications, etc.  

Typing 'build' in each of the directories hubCounters, brokerCounter, 
testCounters creates a single performance Dll for that directory.  That 
performance Dll is used both by the application and the performance 
monitor itself.

This is an implementation of **static** performance counters:  the 
performance counters must be defined before running the application in 
order to be useful.  Counters may not be created dynamically while the 
program is executing.  The reason for this is that installing a perf 
counter a pre-existing key for the perfmon application must be modified.  
If the application dies suddenly, then the perfmon registry entry can 
only be rolled back manually. Datacenter personel have complained that 
dynamic counters are messing up their registries.  

However, Instances (of performance objects, not counters) may be created 
and destroyed dynamicially. This allows the monitoring of, for example, 
open socket connections by name.


Initial Setup:
--------------
Build (type "build -c") in the $(PASSDEV)/common/PerfLibrary and in 
relevant subdirectory (hubCounters or brokerCounters) to build the 
hubCounters.dll or the brokerCoutners.dll.  


Setting Up the Registry
-----------------------
In order to use the perfmon counters you must make chages to you 
registry.  If you do make those changes your application will not be 
affected, but you will not be able to read the perfmon counters!

FIRST BACK UP YOUR REGISTRY!  INSTALLING THE PERFMON COUNTERS MAKES 
CHANGES TO YOUR REGISTRY!  **ESPECIALLY** BACK UP THE KEY:
	
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib]

To install the counters, go to the directory where the <name>Counter.dll 
lives Dll lives (most likely $(PASSDEV)/sdk/lib/i386).  Make sure you have
these three files in that directory.

<name>Counters.dll
<name>Counters.ini
<name>Counters.h

If those three files are not present copy the from dev. tree (most likely
$(PASSDEV/common/PerfLibrary/<name>Counters) and run the command:

'regsvr32 <name>Counters.dll' 

where <name> is hub or broker. You should see the respective key added 
to the "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<name>Counters" 
registry location. This modifes both the above 
"SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<name>Counters" registry key and 
the registry you created when you installed NT at: 
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib"


Uninstalling the Registry
-----------------------
To uninstall the counters, go to the directory where the <name>Counter.dll 
lives Dll lives (most likely $(PASSDEV)/sdk/lib/i386).  Make sure you have
these three files in that directory.

<name>Counters.dll
<name>Counters.ini
<name>Counters.h

If those three files are not present copy the from dev. tree (most likely
$(PASSDEV/common/PerfLibrary/<name>Counters) and run the command:

'regsvr32 /u <name>Counters.dll' 


Class Interface Usage:
----------------------

#include "PassportPerfDefs.h"	    // for SHM name defines
#include "TestCounters.h"		// for counter defines
#include "PassportPerfInterface.h"  // for object interface

static PassportPerfInterface * perf = NULL;

	if (perf == NULL)
	{
		perf = (PassportPerfInterface *) 
				CreatePassportPerformanceObject(
					PassportPerfInterface::PERFMON_TYPE);
		if (perf != NULL)
		{
			if (!perf->init( PASSPORT_PERF_BLOCK))
				// error
		}
		else
			// error
	}
	// to increment a counter without an instance
	if (!perf->incrementCounter(TESTCOUNTERS_PERF_TEST_COUNTER1))
	{
		// error
	}
	
	// to add an instance to that object
	CHAR instanceName[PassportPerfInterface::MAX_INSTANCE_NAME];
	strcpy( instanceName,"Instance");
	if (!PA->addInstance( instanceName ))
	{
		// error
	}

	// to increment a counter with an instance
	if (!perf->incrementCounter(TESTCOUNTERS_PERF_TEST_COUNTER1, instanceName))
	{
		// error
	}
	// note if you try perf->incrementCounter(TESTCOUNTERS_PERF_TEST_COUNTER1)
	// after you've added an instance to that object it will fail
	
	// to modify a counter type
	if (!perf->setCounterType (TESTCOUNTERS_PERF_TEST_COUNTER1, 
				PassportPerfInterface::AVERAGE_TIMER))
	{
		// error
	}

	


Modifying Counters
------------------
The counter definitions for the broker and hub have been created in the 
brokerCounter and hubcounter directory. Modifyiing these counters has a few steps:

1. Make sure you've backed up your registry, especially the 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib] key.

2. go to the directory where the <name>Counter.dll 
lives Dll lives (most likely $(PASSDEV)/sdk/lib/i386).  Make sure you have
these three files in that directory.

<name>Counters.dll
<name>Counters.ini
<name>Counters.h

If those three files are not present copy the from dev. tree (most likely
$(PASSDEV/common/PerfLibrary/<name>Counters) and run the command:

'regsvr32 <name>Counters.dll' 

This will both unistall the previous counters and re-install the new counters

3.  Re-start the perfmon and check to see if the new counters 
are in the addcounter menu.

The source code in this directory can be used to build a DLL that encodes and
decodes several different types of X509 Certificate Extensions, in support of
Policy or Exit Modules for Microsoft Certificate Services, or for any other
code that needs to encode or decode Certificate Extensions.

It is meant to run on Windows NT 4.0 with SP3 or later or on Windows 2000 only.
Certificate Services must already be installed for this DLL to be used by a
Policy or Exit Module.  This DLL implements several COM interfaces to allow C++
or Visual Basic code to encode extensions without having any knowledge of the
Crypto APIs, using only basic COM support and the BSTR data type to represent
binary encoded extensions.

For examples using these interfaces to encode Certificate Extensions, see the
C++ or Visual Basic sample Policy Modules in sibling directories.  The
following routines in the C++ Policy Module encode extensions using interfaces
defined here:
    CCertPolicy::_AddRevocationExtension (ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo)
    CCertPolicy::_AddCertTypeExtension (ICertEncodeBitString)
    CCertPolicy::_AddSubjectAltNameExtension (ICertEncodeAltName)

The Visual Basic policy module encodes the following extension types using
interfaces defined here:
    ICertEncodeStringArray

Once the certenc.dll DLL is built, its COM interface must be registered
via the following command:
    regsvr32 certenc.dll

If you use the certenc.dll built from these SDK sources with the Visual Basic
policy module (policyvb.dll), you must use the SDK version of the Visual Basic
policy module.  This is because the Visual Basic policy module shipped with
Cert Server 1.0 references a sample interface that is no longer provided as
part of certenc.dll.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to build xenrlinf.cab:

1) Make your changes to xenroll.inf and check it in so we'll have it.
   The only reason I know of to change this file is when the list of
   platforms we support changes.

2) Use cabarc.exe to put the xenroll.inf in a cab. You need to leave
   some space for the signature. I have no idea how much is really
   necessary, but the cabarc help mentions 6K. If you determine a
   better size, please update this file. I have checked in cabarc.exe
   because it's not a standard tool, but you should be able to get
   this from a variety of places (ie, the Cabinet SDK).

	cabarc -s 6144 n xenrlinf.cab xenroll.inf

3) Get the cab signed the same way a dll gets signed. I have included
   the list.txt file I used. If you change it, update it here and
   check it in too. See http://prslab/codesign for more info.

4) Check the new signed cab into nt\ds\security\services\ca\certweb.
   The cab will be grabbed from this directory during the build
   (along with the rest of the web pages).

later.  Certificate Services must already be installed.

Certificate Services calls the Exit Module through the ICertExit interface,
and the Exit Module can call back to Certificate Services through the
ICertServerExit interface.

Each time Certificate Services issues a certificate, it passes control to
the ICertExit::Notify method in exit.cpp, specifying that a certificate
has been issued.  The passed Context parameter is used with the ICertServerExit
interface to retrieve properties from the newly issued certificate.

Once the certxsam.dll DLL is built, its COM interface must be registered

SP6 or later or on Windows 2000 only.  Certificate Services must already be
installed.

Certificate Services calls the Exit Module through the ICertExit interface,

Each time Certificate Services notifies the exit module of an event, it passes
control to the CCertExit::Notify method in exit.cls.  The passed Context
parameter can be used with the ICertServerExit interface to retrieve properties
from the request or certificate.  The Notify method may retrieve Certificate
Extensions and other properties, and publish issued certificates or CRLs as
needed.

Once the exitvb.dll DLL is built, its COM interface must be registered via the
following command:
    regsvr32 exitvb.dll
Once registered, the Windows 2000 Certification Authority management console
snapin can be used to make this exit module active.

The Certificate Services service must then be stopped and restarted as a
console application to load the newly registered Exit Module.  Use the Control
Panel's Services applet, and stop the "Certificate Services" service, then
start Certificate Services as a console application via the following command:

NOTE: Because this Visual Basic Exit Module uses a Message Box to display
information, IT MUST BE STARTED VIA THE ABOVE COMMAND AS A CONSOLE APPLICATION
in order to interact with the desktop to display the Message Box and accept the
user's input.

NOTE: To build this Visual Basic Exit Module for Cert Server 1.0, the Name=
value in exitvb.vbp should be changed to:
    Name="CertificateAuthority"

NOTE: Visual Basic Exit Modules will not load under Cert Server 1.0 prior to
NT4 SP6 because of a Visual Basic keyword conflict in the Notify method's Event
parameter.  In SP6, this parameter was renamed to ExitEvent.

NOTE: Due to threading constraints, an ignorable fault may be observed during
Cert Server 1.0 console mode shutdown when running with a Visual Basic Exit

The source code in this directory can be used to build a sample Policy Module
for Microsoft Certificate Services.  It is meant to run on Windows NT 4.0 with
SP3 or later or on Windows 2000 only.  Certificate Services must already be
installed.

Certificate Services calls the Policy Module through the ICertPolicy
interface, and the Policy Module can call back to Certificate Services
through the ICertServerPolicy interface.

Each time Certificate Services receives a certificate request, it passes
control to the CCertPolicy::VerifyRequest method in policy.cls.  The passed
Context parameter is used with the ICertServerPolicy interface to retrieve
properties from the request and potential certificate.  The VerifyRequest
method may add, modify or enable Certificate Extensions, modify the NotBefore
and NotAfter dates and Subject name RDN (Relative Distinguished Name) strings
for the potential certificate.  It must also perform any validation required,
and decide the disposition of the request.  The method should return one of
VR_PENDING, VR_INSTANT_OK or VR_INSTANT_BAD to cause the request to be made
pending, to grant the request and issue the certificate, or to fail the
request.

Once the policyvb.dll DLL is built, its COM interface must be registered
via the following command:
    regsvr32 policyvb.dll
Once registered, the Windows 2000 Certification Authority management console
snapin can be used to make this the active policy module.

The Certificate Services service must then be stopped and restarted as
a console application to load the newly registered Policy Module.  Use the
Control Panel's Services applet, and stop the "Certificate Services" service,
then start Certificate Services as a console application via the following
command:
    certsrv -z

NOTE: Because this Visual Basic Policy Module uses an Interactive Form to
display information passed in the certificate request, IT MUST BE STARTED VIA
THE ABOVE COMMAND AS A CONSOLE APPLICATION in order to interact with the
desktop to display the form and accept the user's input.

NOTE: To build this Visual Basic Policy Module for Cert Server 1.0, the Name=
value in policytvb.vbp should be changed to:
    Name="CertificateAuthority"

NOTE: Due to threading constraints, an ignorable fault may be observed during
Cert Server 1.0 console mode shutdown when running with a Visual Basic Policy
Module.

The source code in this directory can be used to build a sample Policy Module
for Microsoft Certificate Services.  It is meant to run on Windows 2000 or
later.  Certificate Services must already be installed.

This policy module should mimic the Standalone policy module that ships with
the Windows 2000 Certificate Services.

Certificate Services calls the Policy Module through the ICertPolicy
interface, and the Policy Module can call back to Certificate Services
through the ICertServerPolicy interface.

Each time Certificate Services receives a certificate request, it passes
control to the ICertPolicy::VerifyRequest method in policy.cpp.  The passed
Context parameter is used with the ICertServerPolicy interface to retrieve
properties from the request and potential certificate.  The VerifyRequest
method may add, modify or enable Certificate Extensions, modify the NotBefore
and NotAfter dates and Subject name RDN (Relative Distinguished Name) strings
for the potential certificate.  It must also perform any validation required,
and decide the disposition of the request.  The method should return one of
VR_PENDING, VR_INSTANT_OK or VR_INSTANT_BAD to cause the request to be made
pending, to grant the request and issue the certificate, or to fail the
request.

Once the certpsam.dll DLL is built, its COM interface must be registered
via the following command:
    regsvr32 certpsam.dll

Once registered, the Certification Authority management console snapin can
be used to make this the active policy module.

If you wish to see the debug print output from the sample Policy Module,
attach a debugger to the running service process, or stop the Certificate
Services service, then start Certificate Services as a console application
via the following command:
    certsrv -z

security  PAGEREF _Toc475185747 \h  This spec outlines the design of new features planned for SCTS in Windows Whistler & Beyond. It focuses on the engine design and interfaces between engine and UI. UI design (the  ) will be designed in a separate spec. Windows Whistler & Beyond SCTS Features Most of the new features require exported interface changes and structure changes so UI is affected. Most of the new features also require database format changes that expose backward compatibility issues and data migration issues. Security templates format change will affect policy pushdown from new server to old clients (new client w/ old server should be fine because new client recognize old templates). Remote management support will expose more issues with UI talking to engine. All of these issues must be considered during the feature design.  Template/database changes and data migration required for all of these features should be reviewed together so for future releases, we have few problems to face. The features are listed in priority order in this spec. Remove Local Policy There are numerous issues with local security policy/management on Windows 2000. For example, local security settings do not take effect if the domain controller is not available; policy tattoos when it s removed; local policy changes may get overwritten by group policy and that s not obvious; and so on. This task is to improve security policy management on a computer (local or remote). In summary, the proposed solution is to get rid of local security settings from the local security database (secedit.sdb) and UI talks to the local or remote system directly. In other words, security settings on a local/remote computer are not part of  group policy  anymore. In summary, the proposed solution is 1) create a new tattoo table which contains default values for the settings that are/were defined in group policy objects; 2) empty local table in the local policy database at end of setup and it will stay empty thereafter; 3) Local Policy Editor/Security Settings work with actual system (via new argument); 3) Eliminate use of policy filters on wks/srv (non-DCs). The reason to have a separate tattoo table than the local table is to handle setup upgrade case, where the default values for settings controlled by domain GPOs are still needed (after the upgrade). The local table in this case is the working configuration table. One problem to solve (in the new solution) is how to handle tattoo information for settings that contain accounts (such as user rights, group membership). When a group policy setting is removed, the saved pre-policy setting is re-applied in policy propagation. What if this setting contains invalid accounts at the time of re-applying? For example, a user is defined, added a user right. A policy is defined for the user right so the previous setting is saved as the tattoo info. Then the user is deleted (note there is no policy filter running in this design so the user is still in the tattoo table). When the pre-policy setting is re-applied back to the system, an error will occur. One way to fix the above problem is to validate all accounts in the tattoo table before re-applying to the system. The second way to fix is to have policy filter to catch the changes to these accounts.  Local security policy table in the security database is initialized in setup, managed by  Local Security Settings  UI, and used in policy propagation/filter/dcpromo. So to get rid of the local security policy table and fix the tattoo problem, setup/dcpromo, policy propagation, policy filter, and UI interfaces are all affected. Below is the detail tasks/changes.  System Settings Database/Structure Changes Define new flags SCE_ENGINE_SYSTEM and SCE_ENGINE_GPO in SCETYPE. The first type SCE_ENGINE_SYSTEM will be used when UI/client queries/sets information to the system directly and SCE_ENGINE_GPO is used to query domain GPO settings only. Note, the difference between SCE_ENGINE_GPO and SCE_ENGINE_SCP is that SCE_ENGINE_SCP is for all settings in the SCP table (or SMP table if SCP doesn t exist) which may include local tattoo settings. SCE_ENGINE_GPO is for policy database only, for settings defined in domain GPOs if there is any. New Interfaces Both of the interface changes are RPC interfaces that are called by exported interfaces to support local security settings working on the actual system. For detail for the exported interface changes, see  Interface Changes  section. SCEPR_STATUS SceRpcGetSystemSecurityFromHandle(     [in] SCEPR_CONTEXT          Context, // the local policy database handle     [in] AREAPR                 Area, // security policy and/or user rights area     [in] DWORD                  Options, // option for the task     [out] SCEPR_PROFILE_INFO    **ppInfoBuffer, // output buffer     [out] SCEPR_ERROR_LOG_INFO  **Errlog // error occurred if there is any     ); SceRpcGetSystemSettings( Binding_h  hBinding,  // could be bound to local or remote AREA_INFORMATION Area,  // security policy area or user rights area DWORD              Options,               // any option for the task SCE_PROFILE_INFO *ppInfo,  // output buffer for the settings SCE_ERROR_LOG_INFO *pErrLog // errors occurred if there is any Both functions above are to query security settings from the actual system for password policy, account lockout policy, kerberos policy, audit policy, user rights, and security options. The interfaces are implemented by sharing some existing functions (slightly modified) as discussed in  Interfaces changes  section. The second interface (with binding handle) can be used when a user don t have access to the local policy database (to get domain GPO settings), for example, a normal user. SCEPR_STATUS SceRpcSetSystemSecurityFromHandle(     [in] SCEPR_CONTEXT          Context,     [in] AREAPR                 Area,     [in] DWORD                  Options,     [in] SCEPR_PROFILE_INFO     *pInfoBuffer,     [out] SCEPR_ERROR_LOG_INFO  **Errlog     ); SCESTATUS SceRpcSetSystemSettings( Binding_h  hBinding,  // could be bound to local or remote AREA_INFORMATION Area,  // security policy area or user rights area DWORD Options,                            // any option for the task SCE_PROFILE_INFO pInfo,  // output buffer for the settings SCE_ERROR_LOG_INFO *pErrlog // error during the operation if there is any The routines above are to configure actual system setting, using the buffer passed in. The interfaces are implemented by sharing existing functions as discussed in  Interface changes  section. Again, the second interface is required by the normal user case where he doesn t have access to the local policy database handle. The assumption is that settings controlled by group policy (in effective policy table) shouldn t be changed locally (via this routine). So if some of the settings are covered by domain wide group policy, the settings shouldn t be changed in UI.  Interface Changes (for Local Security Settings to call): Modify existing functions so that they can be shared in SceRpcGetSystemSettings/ SceRpcGetSystemSettingsFromHandle. The change is to allow analyzed settings saved in the SAP database as well as stored in the buffer if there is any. ScepAnalyzeSystemAccess ScepAnalyzeSystemAuditing ScepAnalyzeKerberosPolicy ScepAnalyzeRegistryValues ScepAnalyzePrivileges Modify existing functions so that they can be shared in SceRpcSetSystemSettings/ SceRpcSetSystemSettingsFromHandle. The change is to allow system settings configured based on the info buffer passed in. ScepConfigurePrivileges ScepConfigureSystemAccess ScepConfigureSystemAuditing ScepConfigureAuditEvent ScepConfigureKerberosPolicy ScepConfigureRegistryValues Modify the above 11 Scep{Analyze|Configure}Xxx functions. For configuration, these functions will ask for write access and failure to configure one setting won t fail the entire configuration; For analysis, these functions only ask for read access and failure to analyze one setting won t fail the entire analysis. Settings that can t be queried will be returned as  SCE_NO_VALUE Changes to exported interface SceGetSecurityProfileInfo (called by UI): When SCE_ENGINE_SYSTEM is passed in as ProfileType, SceRpcGetSystemSettings or SceRpcGetSystemSettingsFromHandle (depend on if there is a database handle) will be called instead of SceRpcGetDatabaseInfo. The settings will be output in the same type of structure. The areas supported under type SCE_ENGINE_SYSTEM are AREA_SYSTEM_ACCESS and AREA_PRIVILEGES. When SCE_ENGINE_GPO is passed in as ProfileType, SceRpcGetDatabaseInfo is called. The information returned contains domain GPO settings only. Changes to exported interface SceUpdateSecurityProfile (called by UI): When SCE_UPDATE_SYSTEM is passed in as dwMode, SceRpcSetSystemSettings or SceRpcSetSystemSettingsFromHandle (depend on if there is a database handle) will be called instead of SceRpcUpdateDatabaseInfo. The actual system settings will be modified. Note the buffer passed in should only contain dirty settings that have been changed by users. When  Local Security Settings  calls SceGetSecurityProfileInfo to get effective policy (SCE_ENGINE_SCP), the effective policy information will be returned. Please note that this information doesn t contain any local settings. It contains only the policy settings from domain/OU/site. UI should use this information to display  domain policy  and to determine if change is allowed for a system setting. Fix Policy Tattoo problem Database/Structure Changes Create the tattoo table and migrate the local  tattoo  default values in policy propagation if the table doesn t exist (refer to policy propagation changes below). The default values in the tattoo table is copied from the local security settings table under the condition 1) the tattoo table doesn t exist, 2) the setting is coming from a domain, 3) the setting exists in the local table. Setup/dcpromo changes (setupcln.cpp) For setup upgrade, remove the calls to snapshot system security settings (SceRpcAnalyzeSystem). The purpose of these calls ware to have local security table synchronize with the system actual settings so when SCTS UI (old local security settings UI) views/manages security settings, it shows the correct system settings. Because the new SCTS UI will work with the actual system settings directly (after this change), there is no need to make these calls in setup. For both clean install and upgrade, the local policy table and effective table will be emptied at end of setup and policy propagation is always triggered. So by the end of setup, the local security database is mostly empty. If the tattoo table exists, scan through the settings in tattoo table to update the  default  values to the settings in local policy table (this is done before the local policy table is emptied). In dcpromo, when building the default domain and domain controller policy templates, local security policy table shouldn t be used. Instead, the actual system settings should be queried with the new interface SceRpcGetSystemSettings and the default GPOs should be built with info from the actual system settings and the default templates (dcfirst/dcup/defltdc). At end of dcpromo, the local policy and effective policy will be emptied (a policy propagation will always occur because of the new domain information). So by the end of dcpromo, the local security database is empty, because a new product is installed. ??? If a server is joined to a domain and the domain has group policy propagated to this machine, should the settings from the other domain group policy be used as the default GPO settings for the new domain to be? Policy propagation changes: Since there is no local policy in the security database anymore, the effective policy table will only contain policies from the domain, plus settings to reset (from the tattoo table) due to domain policy deletion   this is to fix  tattooing  problem of group policies. Create tattoo table if it doesn t exist and update the database version # if the table is created. Remove the code to copy local policy into effective policy table when the first group policy is imported. Add code to handle tattoo settings after the last group policy template is imported into the effective policy table. In detail, this task contains the following: Loop through effective policy table and search each setting in the tattoo table. If the setting doesn t exist in the tattoo table, it is a new group policy setting. In this case, query the current system setting and save the setting in tattoo table. The security policy and user rights settings can be queried using SceRpcGetSystemSettings (see new interfaces section). Other areas such as group, service, file, key, and so on, must be queried individually. Security for objects (files/keys) should be saved as a single object with flag 0 (inherited) so that the security will be reset in inherited mode. Loop through tattoo table for settings that do not exist in the effective table (this is equivalent to settings that have been deleted in group policy) and move these settings to effective table to reset them. Note, the settings must be moved, namely, copied to effective table then deleted from the tattoo table. Remove extension registration for local group policy mode (in system32\grouppolicy\gpt.ini) because security settings don t belong to group policy anymore and it should be only called when there is group policy from the domain. Eliminate policy filter on wks/srv Since local security policy is removed on wks/srv, there is no need to filter LSA/SAM/registry value changes so policy filter can be removed on wks/srv. Below are the changes to remove policy filter: Return success in policy filter (client call) when it s invoked on a wks/srv. Do not run delayed registry value filter in policy propagation when it s invoked on a wks/srv. The Policy filter is still needed for DCs because the default domain controller GPO is the only way used to synchronize policies among DCs. So unregistering SAM filter in setup does not work well since a server could be promoted to DC. Notes for UI UI will do token check and if non-admin logs on, the settings will be displayed in read only mode. UI must handle errors in configuration/analysis: configuration may fail (in some settings) due to access denied or other reason. In this case, UI has to query the actual system setting again to refresh its buffer. Analysis may fail (in some settings) due to access denied or other reason. In this case, settings that fail will have  SCE_NO_VALUE  in the buffer  UI still displays  policy  column that is queried from the local security database. This information is not modifiable. The information also controls if the local system setting can be modified. One exception here is for user rights where if a user right is defined in add/remove mode, the system settings will contain more accounts than the one specified in the policy and the extra accounts should be allowed to be removed and other accounts should be allowed to be added. In other words, even though domain has a policy defined for the user right, it should still allow local users to add/remove accounts that are not defined in policy, for the user right. UI should remove  PolicyChanged  call UI should call SCTS engine to query the actual system setting w/ SCE_ENGINE_SYSTEM, rather than the local policy table w/ SCE_ENGINE_SMP. UI should extend computer management to work on real system settings. UI should hide nodes when extending local group policy editor. The Security Settings node is not removed from LPE is because this node has other extensions that reside in local policy mode. When UI saves changes to the system, the buffer must contain dirty only items. UI should also group modified settings together (such as all auditing policies) before committing to the system. UI should  enforce  system settings that violate domain policy to be the same as policy. This should occur automatically, either when UI is initialized or when the node is expanded. UI should not allow  import  and  export  functions because UI works on system settings rather than templates. Add/Remove/Set List Items In Windows 2000, restricted groups can be managed via SCTS in two ways   members and memberOf. The limitation of the design is 1) members are configured in replace/overwrite mode only, which means existing members that are not in SCTS are removed from the system; 2) even though memberOf is designed to be the  append  mode, the restricted group must exist on the local SAM and must be a group. Due to these limitations, there is no way to add a user or a domain group to a local group through policy/SCTS, without affecting existing membership. In Windows 2000, user rights can either be  not defined  or completely defined. This is inconvenient and sometimes causing trouble for group policy because the complete settings for a user right on different machines are not same and can t be same. This feature is to enhance restricted group and user rights design to solve the above problems. The proposed solution is to support overwrite mode and append mode for group members and user rights and get rid of memberOf functionality. Besides being able to support a list of users/groups in overwrite mode as well as append mode, the format of each user/group must support both SID and name (free text) and users should be allowed to choose the format for each user/group (via UI).   Implementation Design INF/JET Layout User rights are stored in section [Privilege Rights]. Each line in the section represents a user right. If a user right doesn t exist in the section, it s not defined. If a user right setting exists and contains  Remove  keywords, it s defined in append mode; otherwise, the setting is defined in overwrite mode. When the setting is empty, it s defined in overwrite mode where all existing accounts are removed from the user right. There is no need to have a empty setting in append mode because that means to do nothing. But just in case, if the setting contains only  Remove  keywords without any other account, this setting is defined in append mode and is ignored by SCTS engine. Same rule/syntax applies to restricted group section [Group Membership]. Each line in the section represents a group with its member lists. Memberof list is removed from the product. To maintain backward compatibility and to remote management easier, the key name in [Group Membership] section stays as   group name  plus suffix  __members . If __Memberof or __PrivilegeHeld suffix exists, the line is ignored. INF template version number can t be changed to reflect this change because Win2000 clients can t process templates in versions other than 0 and 1. This brings up a limitation on policy. See policy section below. We should create a bug for SP to fix Win2000 clients. If template versions are greater than it recognizes, it will fail policy propagation. Database Changes Define a status field in configuration and analysis table. This is easier for database parser to get status of each item.  Database version # should be increased with this change and existing databases should be migrated at open time automatically. This could be done in setup time, or any time after setup when a database is asked for opening. Add and remove flag will be imported into the database directly (not expanded) and configured as in append mode. Q: Free text or SID: free text should be converted into SID when importing. What to do when exporting? Structure Changes Remove Definitions static const WCHAR szMembers[]             = L"__Members"; static const WCHAR szMemberof[]            = L"__Memberof"; static const WCHAR szPrivileges[]          = L"__Privileges"; #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_MEMBERS_MISMATCH      0x01 #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_MEMBEROF_MISMATCH     0x02 #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_NC_MEMBERS            0x04 #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_NC_MEMBEROF           0x08 #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_NOT_ANALYZED          0x10 #define SCE_GROUP_STATUS_ERROR_ANALYZED        0x20 SCE_ACCOUNT_LIST - new #define SCE_ACCOUNT_FLAG_STORE_SID #define SCE_ACCOUNT_FLAG_STORE_NAME typedef struct _SCE_ACCOUNT_LIST {     PWSTR  AccountName;     BYTE AccountFlag;     struct _ SCE_ACCOUNT_LIST *Next; } SCE_ACCOUNT_LIST, *PSCE_ACCOUNT_LIST: SCE_PRIVILEGE_ASSIGNMENT #define SCE_ACCOUNT_SET #define SCE_ACCOUNT_ADD typedef struct _SCE_PRIVILEGE_ASSIGNMENT {     PWSTR                           Name;     DWORD                           Value;     PSCE_ACCOUNT_LIST                   AddAccounts;     PSCE_ACCOUNT_LIST                   RemoveAccounts;     DWORD                           Status;     struct _SCE_PRIVILEGE_ASSIGNMENT *Next; } SCE_PRIVILEGE_ASSIGNMENT, *PSCE_PRIVILEGE_ASSIGNMENT; For configuration info, the Status could contain SCE_ACCOUNT_SET or SCE_ACCOUNT_ADD to indicate if the setting is in  overwrite  mode or in  add/remove  mode. For the overwrite mode, the configuration is stored in AddAccounts and RemoveAccounts is NULL; for the add/remove mode, the configuration is stored in both AddAccounts and RemoveAccounts where of course AddAccounts contains the list of accounts to add and RemoveAccounts contains the list of accounts to remove from the user right. For analysis information, the Status field contains the analysis status (match, mismatch, not configured, not analyzed, or error analyzed). The whole list of accounts assigned the user right is stored in AddAccounts list and RemoveAccounts will always be NULL. SCE_PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST #define SCE_PRIVILEGE_FLAG_ADD #define SCE_PRIVILEGE_FLAG_REMOVE typedef struct _SCE_PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST {     PWSTR                   Name;     BYTE                      PrivilegeFlag;     DWORD                  PrivLowPart;     DWORD                  PrivHighPart;     struct _SCE_PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST   *Next; }SCE_PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST, *PSCE_PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST; This structure is used by SCTS configuration engine when configuring user right/privileges. A different structure is defined for the task because user rights are stored by accounts (not by rights) on the system and is easier/faster to configure when information is loaded into this structure. The PrivilegeFlag could contain SCE_PRIVILEGE_FLAG_ADD (when PrivLowPart and PrivHighPart contain user right bits to add) and SCE_PRIVILEGE_FLAG_REMOVE (when PrivLowPart and PrivHighPart contain user right bits to remove from the account). SCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP typedef struct _SCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP {     PWSTR                             GroupName;     PSCE_ACCOUNT_LIST                AddAccounts;     PSCE_ACCOUNT_LIST                RemoveAccounts;     DWORD                             Status;     struct _SCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP  *Next; }SCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP, *PSCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP; For configuration info, the Status could contain SCE_ACCOUNT_SET or SCE_ACCOUNT_ADD to indicate if the setting is in  overwrite  mode or in  add/remove  mode. For the overwrite mode, the configuration is stored in AddAccounts and RemoveAccounts is NULL; for the add/remove mode, the configuration is stored in both AddAccounts and RemoveAccounts where of course AddAccounts contains the list of accounts to add and RemoveAccounts contains the list of accounts to remove from the membership of the group. For analysis information, the Status field contains the analysis status (match, mismatch, not configured, not analyzed, or error analyzed). The whole list of current members for the group is stored in AddAccounts list and RemoveAccounts will always be NULL. Interface Changes SceFreeMemory should be modified to handle the new SCE_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP structure and new SCE_ACCOUNT_LIST structure. SceInfpGetPrivileges and SceInfpGetGroupMembership must be able to read old/mix styled templates in user rights and group membership sections. Old styled user right list is treated as in set mode. If SID can t be resolved to name, the sid string is displayed. SceeInfpWritePrivileges and SceInfpWriteGroupMembership must be able to write new style information to old styled templates for group members list and user right account list. If name can t be resolved to SID, name will be stored. ScepConfigureGroupMembership should take the new structure and add/remove/set group membership as specified in the structure. Should consider loading SID into buffer when configuring, which will save time to lookup the account names back and force. ScepAnalyzeGroupMembership should take the new structure and analyze the groups based on add/remove/set mode (all groups defined plus any built-in groups are analyzed). The analysis logic is to make sure that accounts in the add list exist in the membership and accounts in the remove list don t exist in the membership, or membership matches exactly as the configuration (set mode). If any of the above condition mismatches, a mismatch status is raised for the group; otherwise match status is raised. The whole group membership is written to the analysis result table in both match and mismatch status because we need the whole system settings even when it s matched in order to support the add/remove mode. If error occurs during analysis or groups are not analyzed (due to previous group failure), the groups are raised as ERROR or NOT_ANALYZED status (same as before). Note, when raising the group, the group name plus the suffix is still used as the key. ScepConfigurePrivileges should take the new structure and add/remove/set privileges as specified in the structure. Accounts are loaded into PRIVILEGE_VALUE_LIST by account SID and PrivilegeFlag (add or remove). For set operations, accounts not defined in the list will be enumerated from the system and added to the list with  remove  flag. ScepAnalyzePrivileges should take the new structure and analyze the user rights based on add/remove/set mode (all user rights are analyzed even though they are not defined in the configuration). This follows the same logic as group membership   whole user right assignments are saved in the analysis result table in all status except error or not analyzed status. Note, this requires a status field in the database. ScepGetPrivileges and ScepGetGroupMembership must be able to read old/mix styled database configurations/analysis results in user rights and group membership sections. Old styled user right list is treated as in set mode. When reading configuration information, the settings are read into corresponding buffers for group and user rights in add/remove/set mode. When reading from analysis result table, all user rights or groups in both configuration and analysis table are returned. For the items that are available in configuration table but not analysis table, status NOT_ANALYZED is assigned (new added items) and there are no system settings available for them. Updating user rights and groups in database mode is not allowed !!! ? This is a limitation in UI ??? Remove memberof  All interfaces mentioned in the above section should be modified to remove the code to get/write/configure/analyze memberof and privilegeHeld settings. Memberof and privilegeHeld will be ignored in existing templates/databases by using the new interfaces defined in the above section. These old settings will be removed in the first write with new code. Policy Impact When a group or user right is defined in add/remove mode in multiple GPOs, the final policy for the user right or group should be the  merged  settings from multiple GPOs. New DCs/Old clients There is a limitation of using this feature in a domain policy that is pushed down to old version of clients (such as NT4 or Windows 2000). The policy template in version other than 0 or 1 or in new layout (add/remove for groups) won t be processed for policy. Add or Remove keywords will be treated as a account name therefore unexpected results could occur. This should be fixed in Windows SP1. For a domain hosted by multiple DCs, if one or more DCs are in old version, new format of group policy can t be used. So policy can t be changed until machines affected by the policy is running the same version or newer version OS. This limits the default GPOs in old format (see below). Policy on DCs By default, user rights are parts of domain controller GPO, which affects all domain controllers in the domain. This GPO is also the place/tool to manage user rights for the domain controllers. When domain controller group policy is defined in the new format (for user right or group), policy synchronization between DCs will be a problem when user rights are defined in add/remove mode, even with LSA policy running on DCs. Group membership isn t a problem because they are synchronized in and by DS. Policy filter on DCs   what should it do if user rights are in add/remove mode? One proposed solution is to have this as a  feature . For user rights that need to be available on all DCs, define them in the DC GPO in add/remove mode. If accounts defined in add/remove mode are changed, the change will be filter into the GPO (by policy filter). If other accounts are changed, filter won t trap the change to GPOs. Remote policy management Although this is a feature we don t expose yet, we need to consider it in this change. One problem is the version mismatch between the local computer and the remote machine. There should be some logic defined in the  remote local policy  task to take care if two machines should talk for the first place. If a database from a remote machine (for other machine s configuration) is opened by SCTS tool (UI or cmd tool) by mapping a network drive, what should we do? Notes for UI Remove memberof  The current members and memberof property sheets should be removed and Restricted Group section will use the same UI as user rights section. Support members in append mode Redesign the UI to define a list of users/groups in Add/Remove mode. See spec\nt5\se\secmgr\scodyssey.doc for detail defined by Kirk. Follow the interface changes described in the design for engine. Extend Feature Support   Web Server The secure configuration for different server roles requires all registry value types to be supported in SCTS, also different options to be provided when setting ACL on a registry key, and so on. In this section, the requirement is summarized followed by the design on how is SCTS functions extended. Extended Registry Key Support Registry Value Types The standard registry value types predefined in Windows 2000 include: REG_NONE REG_SZ REG_EXPAND_SZ REG_BINARY REG_DWORD REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN REG_LINK REG_MULTI_SZ REG_RESOURCE_LIST REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST REG_QWORD REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN SCTS in Windows 2000 supports REG_SZ, REG_BINARY and REG_DWORD. It s required that SCTS to support REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, and REG_QWORD (for 64 bit). The following interfaces must be changed to support the above types. For REG_QWORD, we also need to define the data format for INF template and DB. One option is to save it in two fields, separated by comma (highpart, lowpart). ScepConfigureRegistryValues ScepAnalyzeRegistryValues ScepEnumAllRegValues Registry Key Creation This is required by secure Web server configuration. When setting ACL to a registry key, the key should be created if it doesn t exist. In windows 2000, the ACL won t be set and FILE_NOT_FOUND error is returned for the key if the key doesn t exist.  This functionality is required to secure remote registry management (via winreg key). If winreg key doesn t exist, it should be created and set a secure ACL so only people allowed to access this key are able to access the registry. This function can be implemented in the existing registry key (or file security) section. In Windows 2000, there is a flag field defined for each object   inherit (0), ignore (1), overwrite (2). To support the creation, more values are defined for the field: Flag 5, create the object if it doesn t exist, then set SDDL with mode 0 (inherit) Flag 6, create the object if it doesn t exist, then set SDDL with mode 2 (overwrite) Interface Changes include object configuration and analysis. In configuration, SCTS should first call   RegCreateKeyEx or CreateDirectory if the object to configure doesn t exist, then follow the same logic to set ACL. In analysis, if an object doesn t exist and the configuration flag is set to 5 or 6, a mismatch will be logged (rather than logging the error that file/key is not found). Attachment Framework Fine-Tune Area Redefinition See spec in the same subject under SMB security section. The areas must be re-defined in order for attachments being plugged under the root level of SCTS. Attachment Engine Note: this section could be related to the WMI integration. Attachment engine registration with SCTS engine should be checked for duplication of extension names because the extension names will be used as the section names in INF templates and JET databases. Attachment engine should be allowed to use more than one sections in the storage   INF template or JET database. The solution here is to use a suffix plus the extension name as a section name, so all interfaces should allow   PWSTR SuffixSectionName  as a parameter. Attachment engine should support another interface to allow extension engine parsing template data before importing into the database storage. This is to handle generic settings in templates. This importing interface will translate generic settings into machine specific settings (configuration) to save in the database. For example, wild card object name support. For IIS extension, multiple web sites can be supported on one single web server and it s impossible to define settings for a specific web site from group policy (or from customized template). Should we maintain attachment framework compatibility with Windows 2000? There is currently no extension attached to SCTS in Windows 2000 production. Attachment UI All extension attachments should expand  Extensions  node instead of  Services  node as in Windows 2000. All extension attachments should share the UI resources with SCTS UI as much as possible (such as the detail dialogs), or be implemented in the same style as SCTS UI. Support C2 Capabilities SCTS must be able to delete keys and subkeys, value, files, and directories, in order to remove POSIX subsystem and etc. For configuration, this function is to remove the requested objects. For analysis, the objects are checked for existence and match/mismatch status is determined based on the find result. Please note the settings for these objects can t be recovered after a configuration (there is no recovery option for the deletion operations). Files to be removed are handled under FILE_SECURITY area and registry keys/values to remove is handled under REGISTRY_SECURITY area. INF layout change Add a section for each section. For example for file system, add a section [File.Remove] and for registry section, add a section [Registry.Remove]. Within each section, each line represents an object to delete, in the following format: objName, flag where flag could be 0 or 1. 0 means that it s an object (file or value) and 1 means that it s a container (directory/registry key). New Structures Define the section names Define structures Interface Changes Other System boot time Lockout Admin for network access Stop service when disabling service WMI Integration Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) enables the windows platform for monitoring, controlling, and analyzing software, hardware, networks, users, and policies within the enterprise. It provides the plumbing or infrastructure for developers and ISVs to create management applications built directly on top of the management infrastructure. Security settings managed in SCTS should be integrated into WMI so ISVs can build tools to manage/analyze/report system security. This is a huge benefit to both sides   SCTS engine won t depend on UI to expose the functionalities and features, and users can have many tools in different favors to work on the same data.  For more information about WMI, see http://wmig. SCTS-WMI Architecture SCTS in Windows 2000 SCTS in Windows 2000 contains the following components: Engine   scesrv.dll, which works with a system (configuration/analysis), JET database(s), and INF templates. Interfaces are called by the client site scecli.dll Client   scecli.dll, which contains wrappers for setup, policy propagation, dcpromo, policy filter, and interfaces used by SCTS UI (MMC snap-in) and cmdline tool. The client site works with INF storage only. Secedit.exe/MMC snap-in/setup/dcpromo/policy communicate with client site only. SCTS In Whistler & Beyond The goals for SCTS are: Scriptable Create/Modify templates Configure/Analyze a system using the template Reporting analysis result  - schema for databases and templates Extendable Open Attachment Architecture Managable   break engine/UI dependency and allow other tools to share engine data. To achieve the above goals, SCTS should be integrated with WMI to provide schema of SCTS storage and to provide functionalities of SCTS. This means that WMI will be the   of everything SCTS engine does and other components always communicate to us via WMI. This includes UI/cmd tool and attachments. The following SCTS scenarios must be supported via WMI in Whistler or beyond: View INF template Create a new INF template or modify existing template View database configuration and analysis information Import INF templates into database configuration Export database configuration into template Configure w/ a database Analyze w/ a database Attachment framework for view/modify/configure/analyze/import/export Log file view Database-less configuration  Per class configuration Modify database configuration Database-less analysis Local policy mode (view/configure the system settings directly) Attachment RSOP Attachment to Group Policy (scriptable and propagation) Complex queries  In current schedule, the top 8 items will be delivered in Whistler and the rest will be delivered after Whistler. Although the items below  Log file view  are cut from Whistler, they must be considered in Whistler for the schema design to make sure that the schema/framework is expandable in the future, especially for the two items of attachments (RSOP and Group Policy). General Architecture In summary, the SCTS/WMI/Attachment model is as follows: SCTS registers as a WMI provider (instance and method). All attachments of SCTS also register as instance providers. SCTS defines three base classes: SCTS_Template, SCTS_Database, SCTS_AttachmentBase.  SCTS_Template and SCTS_Database are classes for security templates or databases. They contain properties of security templates or databases (such as description and version #), as well as providing static methods to configure/analyze/import/export using the template or database.  SCTS_AttachmentBase is the base abstract class for all attachments to inherit. This class provides static methods for querying data and setting data for each attachment (class name of each attachment will be used as the "section" name in our store). This class is also needed when enumerating all attachments (by enumerating all inherited classes from this base class). Attachment classes inherited from SCTS_AttachmentBase must implement methods to configure/analyze their security. These methods will be called when configure/analyze/etc is requested from SCTS_Template or SCTS_Database. All data classes (either for SCTS defined classes or attachment classes) must have a key for store name and a key for store type in addition to other class specific properties. These two keys are used to link to a security template or database. This model will be explained in detail below. Name Space SCTS will consume one namespace in WMI, in the path of root\security\SCTS. All classes/instances are in a flat view under this namespace, including attachment classes.  Provider SCTS will be registered as an instance provider and a method provider. All SCTS attachments must be registered as instance providers.  Instance providers can support zero or more of the following features by supplying a complete implementation of the corresponding IWbemServices method.:  Data retrieval GetObjectAsync GetObjectAsync Data modification PutClassAsync PutInstanceAsync Data deletion DeleteClassAsync DeleteInstanceAsync Data enumeration CreateClassEnumAsync CreateInstanceEnumAsync Query processing ExecQueryAsync ExecQueryAsync Besides the primary interfaces that an instance provider should support, SCTS instance provider also supports the additional methods for SCTS store class, for example, ApplySecurity (apply security to a system), AnalyzeSecurity, ImportTemplate, and ExportTemplate.  SCTS attachment providers should support the same set of methods for their data. Method providers fully implement a set of methods for a Common Information Management (CIM) object in their primary interface, ExecMethodAsync. All of the other methods return WBEM_E_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. SCTS method provider also supports additional methods that could be used by WMI users such as  Enumerate all registry values supported by SCTS Enumerate all privileges supported by SCTS Enumerate all audit categories supported by SCTS Questions: The methods that attachments implement in their classes for configuring/analyzing/importing/exporting are used in SCTS provider to invoke the appropriate operation requested by users (via store classes). These methods shouldn t be visible to WMI users. Is this possible - No? What other options do I have? Base Classes The following base classes SCTS_Template, SCTS_DatabaseConfiguration, SCTS_DatabaseAnalysis, and SCTS_AttachmentBase are defined.  SCTS_Template is a class representation of security templates (INF). It contains key path name to a template as well as other properties of a template, for example, description and version #. To support database-less configuration, this class will also provide a static method  ApplyTemplate  to allow configuration using the template. This class is read only.  SCTS_DatabaseConfiguration is a class representation of security database for configuration information. It contains key path name to a database and other properties of a database, such as description, version #, configuration timestamp, and etc. This class is read only. SCTS_DatabaseConfiguration also provides static methods for configuring/analyzing/importing/exporting.  SCTS_DatabaseAnalysis is a class representation of security database for analysis information. It contains key path name to a database and other properties of a analysis database, such as analysis time stamp, summary of analysis, and etc. This class is read only and no method is provided. SCTS_AttachmentBase is an abstract class for attachments to inherit. It contains inheritable properties for key store name (template or database name) and key store type. It provides static methods to query and set attachment data to the storage (template or configuration database). It also provides method prototypes that attachments must implement for configuration/analysis/import/export. SCTS_Log class describes the log format for SCTS operations. It provides properties of one log record and methods to put one log record from/to the log file on disk.  Questions: Do we really need to have two separate base classes for SCTS_DatabaseXXX? The attachment methods (configuration/analysis/import/export) are only meaningful for configuration database. How should attachment providers block these methods for other storage types? Other Consideration To handle multiple instances of user who might open the same template in multiple sessions, the design is to let them share the same WMI instances for the template and register themselves to get notified whenever a template is changed (so they can refresh their buffer). To support granular configuration/analysis, All data classes (including SCTS core and attachments) must support a  Apply  method.  To support  local policy mode  where system settings are managed, all data classes must be associated with WMI system object. The associated class is SCTS_LogicalSystemSecuritySetting. This class provides get and set methods that query/set security settings from/to the system directly. All derived classes from this base class derive the same methods that allow configuration on a per class basis. For account policies and local policies (as exposed in local policy mode in Windows 2000), all system settings could be viewed/modified through the logical association classes. For database-less configuration, the SCTS_Template class should support a  Apply  method. Attachments should also support a  Apply  method without database argument. For database-less analysis, a place holder should be defined in WMI and more work must be done in engine   to figure out where the database is for the logon user. The place holder is key ed on logged on user s SID (which means that one user can have only one active workspace to do configuration/analysis). Multiple templates must be able to be grouped together to configure/analyze (merged in append mode). The database concept is still supported since there might be other needs where analysis information needs to be saved in the database. SCTS attachments should also be under group policy   be able to create policy data (in SCTS templates) and propagate their policy data. Attachments also need to provide RSOP (diagnosis and planning mode) data. See attachment architecture below for detail. Complex queries are needed to provide higher level of operations on security settings, such as grouping settings together. The picture below shows the architecture of SCTS in WMI namespace. <picture here> Integrated Attachment Architecture Not all security aspects of every component/application are managed by SCTS core engine. To unify security management into one tool and one unified storage, a open attachment architecture is defined in Windows 2000. This is done by attachments registering with SCTS and implementing well-defined interfaces for configuration, analysis, and editing of their own security data. SCTS is responsible to invoke appropriate attachments and to save their data into the security template(s) and database(s) together with other security data.  In order to expose attachments  data and get the benefits of scriptability and manageability, the open attachment model should be integrated into WMI as well. This will also break the  hardcoded  link between SCTS and its attachments. In the new WMI SCTS attachment model, security attachments of SCTS should manage their own configuration/analysis and communicate with SCTS to incorporate data into SCTS storage. All communication of data is done via WMI classes. Base Classes All attachments must inherit the base abstract class defined by SCTS   SCTS_AttachmentBase and implement the methods required by this class. One attachment can have multiple classes and the class name will be used as the  section  name in SCTS storage. This is guaranteed unique since WMI enforces the uniqueness of class names in one name space. For group policy plugin, attachments must inherit from SCTS_AttachmentGroupPolicy which inherits from group policy base class (to be defined). This class contains the group policy ID, name, and template name. This class should support import and export functionalities. For policy propagation, attachments should registered with group policy as an extension to propagate policy. They should use the QueryData method (provided in the base class) to get data from group policy templates and apply the data to a system. Attachments should define RSOP extension schema to extend SCTS RSOP schema. During policy propagation, attachments will be called by group policy (directly) to apply/log/generate RSOP data. Questions: Are there other options for attachments to handle group policy and RSOP data, for example, attachments do not implement as group policy extensions. Instead, SCTS invoke them during policy propagation/generation and group policy. How to do this? Attachment Providers Each attachment should implement a WMI instance provider to support their class instances as well as to provide methods to configure/analyze/import/export. The instruction/procedure for the registration are documented in WMI SDK   provider registration procedure. The attachment providers should be registered with WMI under namespace Root\Security\SCTS. The attachment instance provider should implement the standard Get/Put/Enum/Del for its own class instances. SCTS Scenarios Walkthrough Each scenario listed in the general architecture section is discussed in detail here. To simplify the process, each scenario is walked through with SCTS data, for example, password policy, as well as attachment data, for example, SMB extension. Remote management is not considered here because WMI is remotable. WMI users could connect to a remote WMI to request operations on the remote machine. The general problems with all  write  operations are Locking, Transactioning, and multiple views. These features will be supported after Whistler. View INF template An INF security template may contain SCTS security data and attachments data. WMI users view a template by issuing a query or calling the get method directly. WMI query Select * from <ClassName> where PathName= c:\foo\test.inf  and StoreType=1 GetObject(//./root/security/SCTS/<ClassName>:PathName= c:\foo\test.inf  && StoreType=1) SCTS Provider When password policy is requested, WMI evaluates the request and calls to SCTS provider for class SCTS_PasswordPolicy to get instances for the template specified. SCTS provider will read password policy data from the template and create an instance of the class then returns. Attachment Provider When SMB data is requested, WMI evaluates the request and calls to SMB provider for the class (for example, SCTS_SMB_Shares. SMB provider is invoked here because it registers itself as a provider for the class. When it s called, SMB provider will call the static method GetDataFromStore implemented in the base abstract class SCTS_AttachmentBase. This method will take the template name, the class name, and returns the buffer in key=value format. Attachment data could be queried in a series of GetDataFromStore calls (via EnumHandle) until return code from this API becomes ERROR_NO_MORE_DATA.  Taking the data returned from GetDataFromStore, SMB provider will create the instances for the requested class. Create new INF templates WMI users create a template by issuing an update query or calling the put method directly. WMI query Update <properties/values> to <ClassName> where PathName= c:\foo\test.inf  and StoreType=1 PutObject(ThisObjct, //./root/security/SCTS/<ClassName>:PathName= c:\foo\test.inf  && StoreType=1) SCTS Provider To create password policy in a template, WMI users first an instance of the class with appropriate data then calls to WMI to   the instance. WMI evaluates the request and calls to SCTS provider for class SCTS_PasswordPolicy to put the instance into the template specified in the class. SCTS provider will read the password policy class instance and save the data to the template. Attachment Provider Same logic here as password policy for WMI users to create the WMI instance for SMB data, then WMI users will call the query or put method to request the save (to WMI). WMI evaluates the request and calls to SMB provider for the class (for example, SCTS_SMB_Shares). When it s called, SMB provider will call the static method SaveDataToStore implemented in the base abstract class SCTS_AttachmentBase. This method will take the template name, the class name, and the buffer, and save it in the template. Validation All data must be validated for range and dependency relationship. WMI doesn t support these kinds of validation even though they are defined in schema. Each provider has to perform the task. Bundle Changes WMI user makes the decision if he wants to bundle all changes to a template into one transaction (  action). Assuming WMI support the transaction functionality, WMI user needs to call BeginTransaction before making any change and CommitTransaction after all changes being made. WMI will cumulate all changes until CommitTransaction is called, when WMI sends all changes to the provider(s).  Questions: Saving multiple changes in one transaction could fail in either SCTS provider or attachment providers. How to handle the errors? Note that data written to the file (in current design) is not revertable. So if errors occur, the CommitTransaction call will return failure, which causes WMI rolls back all WMI changes. How do we keep the template accurate? One solution is to provide SCTS methods for transitions   SCTSBeginTransaction, SCTSCommitTransaction, and SCTSRollbackTransaction. When SCTSBeginTransaction is called for a template, SCTS provider will make a temp copy of the template and all changes thereafter are written to the temp file until SCTSCommitTransaction is called, when the temp file will be copied back to the original. Modify existing templates Modifying existing templates follow similar logic as creating new templates for add/overwrite settings. It has the same issues for bundling changes into one transaction as discussed above and the same solution applies. In addition to the add/overwrite operation, delete operation must be supported for classes that could have multiple instances in a template. In SCTS scope, the exception classes are password, lockout, and kerberos. All other classes may have multiple instances. For the exception classes, there is no  delete  needed. Properties could be changed to  not defined  and when the instance is put back, the object associated to the property will be deleted from the template. Deletion of instances could be done in several ways: Delete a single instance from a class The Delete method of the provider will be called by WMI directly. SCTS provider deletes the object (by key) from the template directly. Attachment providers have to call SetDataToStore with the DELETE_KEYS option. Question:  File objects and registry keys will have problems to be deleted based on keys since there is no keys in these sections. What should we do: load all section into buffer, dremove the object(s) from the buffer, delete the whole section from the file then save all data back.  Change template layout to have object name as keys. This will introduce a compatibility issue with group policy or remote management. The way to resolve the compatibility issue is to have a version #. Old clients/machines can t open newer version of templates. So policy propagation will be affected. Delete all instances of a class Each provider should support a query, something like: delete * from <classname> where PathName= c:\foo\test.inf Internally this query is translated to delete the whole section (class name) in the template. If a class is for attachment providers, they need to call SetDataToStore with EMPTY_SECTION option. Delete all classes from a template This is equivalent to delete the template from disk. All of these functions should be supported by Win32 schema. SCTS may need to provide a method doing this in order to allow multiple users viewing the same file. When the file is deleted, this method should broadcast events for the deletion so other users who are viewing the file will get notified to refresh their data. Import other templates This feature is not supported in Whistler. The design here is for post Whistler. To allow multiple incremental templates to be imported into a unified template, SCTS provider will provide a static method  ImportTemplate  in SCTS_Template. A template can be imported in  append  mode or  overwrite  mode where  append  mode adds data from the importing template on top of existing data and  overwrite  mode is to replace all data in the existing template.  SCTS provider will get all available sections in the importing template by calling GetPrivateProfileSectionNames api. For SCTS sections, it imports the data (following the import rule) and for attachment data, it calls to each class (section name) s import method. The importing rule includes append/overwrite mode, convert machine specific info, and etc. Export generalized templates The only reason that a template is exported to another template (both in INF format) is to convert machine specific information into generalized virtual information. For example, accounts are saved in template in SID format that contains machine SID or domain SID. To make it generic, %MachineSid% or %DomainSid% must be used in the exported template. Accounts in names such as IIS_<ComputerName> must be converted to this form since its SID on different machines is different. Another example is that object names (files/keys) should be converted into env variables and wildcard format too. A static method ExportGenericTemplate should be implemented in SCTS_Template to accomplish the task. This method is very useful in group policy perspective and configuring multiple machines with same security configuration.  In the implementation of the method, SCTS provider get the list of sections (classes) in the template, exports its own classes, then calls attachments for the rest of classes. Attachment providers should implement a method to export data where GetDataFromStore (from the exporting template) is called for each attachment data, change the machine/domain specific information, then SetDataToStore (to the exported template). View database information This applies to both configuration information and analysis information. The logic is same as viewing INF templates except that the StoreType is 2 or 3 for database configuration or database analysis. Import configuration into database (create a new database) SCTS_ConfigurationDatabase implements a static method  ImportTemplate  which allows importing a template into a configuration database. This database is then used to configure/analyze a system. Database is machine centric so when a template is imported, all generic information will be resolved based on the information available on the machine. Items to resolve include environment variables, special accounts, machine/domain SIDs. Wildcard object names will be handled in configuration rather than importing. See separate feature design for wildcard support and environment variable support. WMI users can make a call to the ImportTemplate method, providing a database name and other arguments. SCTS provider will do the work to import the template. For attachment data, SCTS provider will get a list of available attachment classes (sections) in the template and call each one of them to import their own data. This is necessary due to the same reason as SCTS has   resolve generic info. Importing a template into a database is the only way to create a new database. Export database configuration into template(s) The logic is same as exporting generic information from a template except the following: The static method: ExportToTemplate The class (implement the method): SCTS_ConfigurationDatabase Attachment implemented method: ExportToTemplate (calls to GetDataFromStore and SetDataToStore). Multiple templates may be created based on the size of the template because INF file size has a usable limit. This is decided and managed by SCTS engine. This feature is needed for snapshot security case. See separate spec for this feature s detail. Configure system w/ a database Once one or more INF templates are imported into the configuration database, the database can be used to configure a system.  WMI users can call a static method  ConfigureSystem  implemented in SCTS_ConfigurationDatabase to configure the local system. The method takes a database name, an optional template name, and other arguments.  SCTS provider SCTS provider is invoked for the request. If a template is provided, first it will do  import  operation on the template, as discussed in  Import configuration into database  section. Attachments may be invoked here for the import. After importing, SCTS engine starts configuration of core security settings. Then SCTS provider get a list of attachment classes and call each one to configure their portion.  Attachment providers Attachment providers must implement a method  ConfigureComponent  which takes a store name, a store type, an optional log file name, and etc. to configure security aspects of the component. Each attachment first queries data from the store by calling GetDataFromStore, plans the configuration, then applies to the system. Logging During configuration, a log file will be created if it s provided. SCTS will write log record to the file directly. The log file path is passed into each attachment. Log record can be created for attachments by creating instance(s) of the class and put into WMI, which calls to SCTS provider to save the record. Analyze system w/ a database Analysis can be performed on a system given a database. The configuration portion of the database is used to compare with the system and the analysis portion of the database is created during analysis. The analysis database is read only from WMI users perspective. WMI users call a static method  AnalyzeSystem  implemented in SCTS_ConfigurationDatabase to analyze the local system. The method takes a database name, an optional log file name, and other arguments. SCTS provider SCTS provider is invoked for the request. SCTS provider just simply passes the call to SCTS engine to analyze core system settings. Then SCTS provider gets a list of attachment classes and calls each one to analyze its component. Attachment providers Attachment providers must implement a method  AnalyzeComponent  which takes a database name, an optional log file name and etc. to analyze the security aspects of its component. Each attachment first queries configuration data from the store by calling GetDataFromStore, performs the analysis, then saves analysis data to analysis database by calling SetDataToStore. Logging During analysis, log records are created if a log file name is passed in. Same as in configuration, SCTS will write log record to the file directly. The log file path is passed into each attachment. Log record can be created for attachments by creating instance(s) of the class and put into WMI, which calls to SCTS provider to save the record. Analysis rule Each provider decides the rule for its own analysis. The rule determines how should analysis data be displayed in some UI tools and how should analysis data be interperated. SCTS provider compares system settings with configuration and raises mismatches/errors to analysis database. All matched items are not raised in analysis database. Even if some settings are not defined in the configuration, they are still analyzed by SCTS engine (for example, password, kerberos, lockout, audit policy, user rights, security options, event log settings, services, all builtin groups and the roots of files and registry keys). The analysis status for these items are  not defined Attachment providers should determine their own analysis rule, for example, they can decide that data for all statuses (match, mismatch, not defined, errors, etc) are saved in analysis database. Question:  how is analysis rule saved in analysis database for each attachment, and how is the rule stored in WMI schema? Log file view Log files are created in operations such as configure/analyze system. In order to publish the log format in WMI (for view or add new records), each log record must be formalized. A class SCTS_Log is defined for this purpose. It supports Get/Enum methods, also supports the Put method with validation logic to ensure that only new records being added to the log and existing records can t be deleted or modified. WMI users can query log records from a log file by issuing standard WQL query. Attachment providers should call the put method to add new log record to the log file.  In order to create WMI instances from log files, SCTS log file format must be changed and SCTS engine must provide interfaces for SCTS provider to log. Database-less configuration This is to allow configuring a system without importing to a database. This feature is useful when users just want to configure the system settings and do not worry about analysis using the database and do not want to leave the useless database on the system.  This scenario doesn t have a WMI view.  If database-less analysis is not implemented at the same time as database-less configuration, this could be done by generating a temporary database name and passes the temp name to all methods. All other operations will operate normally as  Configure system w/ a database . After configuration is done, the database is unloaded and deleted. Two problems with this approach: The location of the temporary database: if it s stored in each user s profile, the database path may contain DBCS characters, which is not supported by JET. The database must be marked  not recover  and properly detached from Jet engine before it s deleted, because otherwise JET engine will hang at the next start trying to find the database and recover it. If database-less analysis and configuration is implemented in the same fix (in engine), it could be done as discussed in database-less analysis section   allocate one and only one hidden database for each log on user. Modify database configuration Modifying data in a configuration database follows the same logic and inherits all problems as modifying existing templates. For detail on the solution, see  Modifying existing templates  section. This feature is not designed for Whistler is due to the complexity of the relationship between configuration and analysis database. When data in a configuration database is changed, the corresponding analysis view is not accurate anymore. We need to figure out a way to either notify the viewers about analysis result change or to block the change if the analysis database is being opened. Database-less analysis SCTS engine will support database-less analysis operation by using a hidden database for each logged on user (for example, the hidden database is placed in the user s profile which requires the fix from JET engine to support DBCS path name). From WMI users point of view, the same classes defined for template mode and database mode can be used. The path name is the username and the store type is either configuration or analysis. When SCTS or attachment providers are invoked for their classes, they follow the same logic as database operations and handle the parameters to SCTS engine to process. We don t want to totally hide the database concept because it is still useful for users who would like to save analysis history etc. Manage system settings, per class configuration One option is to use computer name as the path name (the local computer name) and computer settings as the store type. For remote computers, connect to WMI on the remote machine. All classes should provide a  ApplyData  method for the computer store type. This method will configure the settings defined in WMI instances to the system. Another option is to associate SCTS classes with predefined Win32 system classes. TBD. Group policy scriptbility Can I define private properties that are not visible to WMI users? This is needed to   the security template name for the GPO. Assuming security extension will be invoked via WMI methods. Define a base class inheriting GPPolicyExtension for security extension, which implements the required methods to create/save/import/export etc. Define classes inheriting GPPolicyExtension class, for all data objects (password policy to ACLs) as defined in SCTS schema Register a provider for the above classes under //./root/GP namespace. This provider can share some common routines with SCTS provider to create WMI instances of each class. The Save method (to save WMI instances into a security template in a GPO) should query all existing WMI instances for the above classes and save them into the file so provider shouldn t do anything for the put method.  How to handle delete operation of WMI instances? Import/Export will block user rights/group membership sections and   existing stuff into the destination GPO. SCTS Attachments Attachment RSOP Attachments need to define schema to inherit from the base Group policy RSOP class (in RSOP namespace) Attachments should provide a method to propagate policy. When Security settings extension is called to propagate policy, it will propagate its own policy then connects to WMI to enumerate then call each attachment s propagate policy method. The list of templates is passed into the method.  Each attachment should use the same mechanism accessing one template to process the list of templates. While applying the policy, it should also log RSOP data in their own schema. Same logic applies to generating planning RSOP data. Attachments should provide a method to generate policy and this method is called in this mode. Complex queries  SCTS Schema Classes Properties are all private to the class. Methods to manipulate the properties should be provided (not documented here since they are standard).

This increases the cost of defining and diagnosing policy for a domain. RSOP (Resultant Set Of Policy) infrastructure will provide the ability.  RSOP is based on WMI, provides public method of exposing what each extension would do or has done, and enables the creation of rich products and tools for diagnostic and planning purposes. To deliver the feature, all group policy extensions including security settings must be RSOP enabled.

Every policy extension is responsible to populate its own data into these databases. The diagnostic data on a machine is periodically refreshed in the winlogon group policy propagation engine. This is done via a new registered interface from the extension: DWORD WINAPI SceProcessSecurityPolicyGPOEx( IN DWORD dwFlags, IN HANDLE hToken, IN HKEY hKeyRoot, IN PGROUP_POLICY_OBJECT pDeletedGPOList, IN PGROUP_POLICY_OBJECT pChangedGPOList, IN ASYNCOMPLETIONHANDLE pHandle, IN BOOL *pbAbort, IN PFNSTATUSMESSAGECALLBACK pStatusCallback, IN IwbemServices *pWbemServices  The interface must be registered under the same registry key with a name  ProcessGroupPolicyEx , REG_SZ. This function is called by winlogon/userenv as part of applying group policy as well as logging RSOP data to the WMI database. In Windows 2000 security policy propagation, GPO templates are cached then imported into the security database (effective policy table). If errors occur during caching/importing, the entire policy set is discarded (to control all policy or zero policy business rule). This is all done in server site in a JET database.  In order to log RSOP data while applying security policy, a new function must be defined (on the client site of SCTS) to support WMI operations (logging). The problems to consider when implementing this function are: Error occurred during caching   no policy will be applied/logged Error occurred during applying   some of the policy are wrong, what to do for RSOP data? Is there transaction concept in WMI database? Partial RSOP data is logged then error occurred, what to do? - rollback Asynchronous support? The account lookups must be done in UI when the data is being viewed because account names could be changed between policy propagations. DWORD ScepLogSecurityPolicyRSOPData( IN IWbemServices *pWbemServices, IN PGROUP_POLICY_OBJECT pGPOList, IN BOOL *pbAbort After all GPO templates are successfully imported into security database, this function deletes all RSOP data (from previous propagation) from the WMI database and commits the change. Then this function loads the last (winning) GPO template first and works backward. For a given setting, it searches in the WMI database first to get the precedence #. If the setting doesn t exist in WMI database, precedence # is 1. (For multi-value type of settings that may come from multiple GPOs, the precedence # is determined in the same logic as the merging.) The setting is logged to WMI with the precedence # and an error code SCEPOLICY_ERROR_NOT_APPLIED for diagnosis mode and SCEPOLICY_SUCCESS for planning mode. The pWbemServices pointer must be marshell ed to the server site of SCTS. When any setting is applied, whether successfully or with error, the setting must be logged to RSOP database again with the correct error value (success or the actual error). This is done by utilizing the internal functions implemented in the above log function. Only error cdoe is re-logged to the RSOP database. Questions:  What if logging fails? Log RSOP data for Planning Mode A WMI database is used to store the planning data from each policy extension. Every policy extension is responsible to populate its own data into these databases. The planning data is logged when RSOP tool is manually invoked and all extensions are called. Extensions are invoked via a new registered interface: DWORD WINAPI SceGenerateRSOPSecurityPolicy( IN DWORD dwFlags, IN BOOL *pbAbort, IN WCHAR *pwszSite, IN PRSOP_TARGET pComputerTarget, IN PRSOP_TARGET pUserTarget where RSOP_TARGET is defined as: WCHAR * pwszAccountName; WCHAR * pwszNewSOM; SAFEARRAY * psaSecurityGroups; PRSOPTOKEN pRsopToken; PGROUP_POLICY_OBJECT pGPOList; IwbemServices * pWbemServices; This interface must be registered under the same registry key as Diagnosis mode with a value name  GenerateGroupPolicy , REG_SZ.  Same ScepLogSecurityPolicyRSOPData function should be called to generate the planning mode RSOP data, following the same logic as diagnosis mode (phase I). This assumes that the pGPOList passed to each extension is already filtered with the security groups. Questions: What are the security groups for? Environment Variable Support Besides the standard system/user environment variables, the following SCTS environment variables should be hardcoded in addition to %SystemDirectory%, and %SystemDrive%: %BootDrive% %DSDIT% %DSLOG% %SYSVOL% %CSIDL_COMMON_XXX% values which include: CSIDL_COMMON_ADMINTOOLS  File system directory containing administrative tools for all users of the computer.  CSIDL_COMMON_ALTSTARTUP  File system directory that corresponds to the nonlocalized Startup program group for all users.  CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA  Application data for all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data.  CSIDL_COMMON_DESKTOPDIRECTORY  File system directory that contains files and folders that appear on the desktop for all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Desktop.  CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS  File system directory that contains documents that are common to all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents.  CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES  File system directory that serves as a common repository for all users' favorite items.  CSIDL_COMMON_PROGRAMS  File system directory that contains the directories for the common program groups that appear on the Start menu for all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs. CSIDL_COMMON_STARTMENU  File system directory that contains the programs and folders that appear on the Start menu for all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu.  CSIDL_COMMON_STARTUP  File system directory that contains the programs that appear in the Startup folder for all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.  CSIDL_COMMON_TEMPLATES  File system directory that contains the templates that are available to all users. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Templates.  %ComputerName% or %DomainName% (in Account names and SDDL) Implementation Design Database Changes Define a new column in the configuration tables (including local table, and policy tables) for environment variable ID   EnvID, SINGLE type. Define a new table dynamically for environment variables used. The table will have 3 columns: EnvID, EnvName, EnvValue. Define three indexes in the table, for each of the three columns. The EnvID will be automatically incremented for a new env variable.  The table will be deleted (ID reset to 0) when a template is imported into the database with  overwrite  mode. Import Templates Account Names Account names in SDDL strings, user rights, and group members could contain %ComputerName% and %DomainName% for any account domain accounts. These accounts must be translated into the appropriate account SIDs (or names with machine name) when the template is imported into a database. This requires: Define a function to replace %ComputerName% with the real computer name and %DomainName% with the primary domain name. This function should be called for all SDDL strings, user right list and group list (group name and members list). Files Add CSIDL_COMMON_XXX variables to the hardcoded SCTS environment function  ScepTranslateFileDirName Change environment variable lookup routine to lookup system standard environment first, then lookup the hardcoded SCTS variables. This change is to ensure that system standard environment variables take precedence. Write a function to detect boot drive. This requires some setup code to query the boot sector. SCESTATUS ScepGetBootDrive(LPTSTR szBootDrive,                                  DWORD *dwLen); Write a function to get location for %DSDIT% and %DSLOG%. This requires coordination with DS group (to have them posted) or have SCTS to post them in dcpromo. SCESTATUS ScepGetDSLocation(LPTSTR szDSDIT,       DWORD nFlag,       DWORD *dwLen); Write a function to get location for %SYSVOL%. This requires working with net share apis to query the path of share  SYSVOL . But note that this share is not ready to be published in dcpromo and at boot time. So SCTS has to be able to handle the case when this share doesn t exist. SCESTATUS ScepGetSharePath(LPTSTR ShareName, LPTSTR szSharePath, DWORD *dwLen All environment variables will be stored in a environment variable table so that when the configuration is exported, the correct environment variable is used. The configuration table is linked to the environment table with EnvID. SCESTATUS ScepAddEnvironmentVariable( IN LPTSTR EnvName,  IN LPTSTR EnvValue,  OUT DWORD *ID Export Templates The configuration stored in a database (either imported from a template, or defined directly through UI) doesn t contain any environment variable. All environment variables defined in a security template are mapped to the system locations during importing. So when exporting from a database configuration, the machine-specific path should be converted back to environment variables. This could be done by mapping the individual object setting to the  environment variable  table by EnvID. SCESTATUS ScepReverseEnvironmentVariable( IN LPTSTR ObjectName, IN DWORD EnvID, OUT LPTSTR *ExportName Since the environment variables used to import the security templates are saved within a database, configuration exported from a database that is copied from a different machine or is remotely connected will use the same environment variables as used in importing. Another option should be defined for the export function: /independent. This option will map the account domain accounts in SDDL strings, user rights, and restricted groups to %ComputerName% or %DomainName% before exporting into the template. SCESTATUS ScepReverseAccountDomainAccounts( IN LPTSTR szAccount, // could be SID format or name format OUT LPTSTR *ExportName Notes for UI The UI should support two modes of template modification corresponding to whether or not we automatically provide environment variable conversion: If Automatic Environment Variable Conversion is ON: We automatically display and store all recognized environment variables (system or hardcoded) whenever the user chooses a path that can be expressed in terms of an environment variable. If Automatic Environment Variable Conversion is OFF: We never convert anything for the user and accept environment variables only when the user explicitly types them in. Toggling Automatic Environment Variable Conversion only affects future modifications. Object Names in Wildcard When using SCTS in Windows 2000 to define templates, we realized that there is a need to support wildcard (*) in object names, for example, unknown object names in the path or duplicate object settings. When a portion of a key (full name) contains a dynamically generated name, there is no way to define a static template for the exact key name. When a lot of files under a directory share the same permission setting, it will take time to define each one of them in a template and it will take more memory/time to process each one of them.  On analysis, any object included by the regular expression should be called out explicitly if there is a mismatch. For file system and registry objects, the * may appear in any portion of the path, except the root directory.  For example, %systemroot%\* %systemdirectory%\*.dll MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\*\Properties Print Security section also has a need for wildcard printer names because same type of printers or printers within a division could share the same setting. Wildcard printer name is documented in section 3 (spooler security). For printer objects, since they do not have a hierarchy, it only makes sense to support the * at the root (which is also the leaf) level.  For example, Implementation Design In Windows 2000, when file/registry key objects are to be processed, they are first loaded into memory in a tree hierarchy. When a lot of objects are defined, the memory taken to build the tree will increase, which puts a limitation on how many objects (in configuration) we could process. With support of wildcard names that represent a lot of objects, it will get us into the above trouble if each single object is expanded into the tree. So the design is to save wildcard object names in configuration table and dynamically expand the objects when configuring/analyzing. This brings up questions 1) how to compute the inherited security information for wildcard objects, 2) how to configure/analyze system using the tree containing wildcard names, and 3) how to report analysis result to users. Remember that file object name could also contain environment variables, in addition to wildcard path names, for example, %windir%\system32\*.dll. Environment variables will be expanded at importing, as designed in  Environment Variable Support  section. This section focuses on wildcard support only. Building the object tree When configuring/analyzing objects, the object tree is built in order to compute inherited security. For wildcard object names, if the wildcard (*) is not in a leaf node (the last part of the object name), it will be expanded dynamically when building the tree and all expanded objects are added to the tree. If the wildcard (*) is in the last part though, it won t be expanded because all of the objects share the same kind of inheritance and there is no configuration object underneath (to depend on the inherited info from the wildcard nodes). When analyzing, each individual object will be analyzed based on configuration (either a wildcard object setting, or explicitly defined object setting). If mismatch is determined, the individual object name is saved to the analysis table. In order for UI to display how is the mismatch status determined, the configuration setting based on must be linked. For this purpose, the original object name (with or without wildcard) must be stored in the tree together with the expanded object name, so both names can be saved to analysis result table.  When computing the inherited security information, it s important to know if an object is a container because inherited security could be different depending on this attribute (container inherit or object inherit). For wildcard objects, it s stored in one node in the tree but it could represent both containers and non-containers. To handle this case, two different security should be computed, one for container, one for non-container. When configuring/analyzing the wildcard objects, if an object is a container, the container- inherited security will be used to process the object and all of its children; otherwise, the object-inherited security will be used for the object only. SCTS inheritance mode (Overwrite/inherited/ignore) for wildcard objects should be treated the same way as it s defined for a regular object. The wildcard objects will be enumerated and each object (tree) found will be processed based on the inheritance mode flag (calling marta or NT security apis). Analysis Result and View Only the mismatched objects are saved in the analysis result table. Not configured objects are not saved as Windows 2000 does. Each mismatched object has a link to the configuration object from which the mismatch status is determined. For a given configuration object, all mismatched child objects can be queried based on this link. See more detail information in the Partial Tree Object View under UI design. If there is no configuration information for the object section, no object is analyzed and displayed. Q: Should all drives/registry hives be analyzed even though they are not defined in the configuration? This is useful to know if a drive doesn t support ACL (FAT system) or other drives are available on the system. If all drives are to be analyzed, only the root level is analyzed.   how is this information being viewed then ? Editing Security of existing configuration objects can be modified (which will erase all mismatch ed info resulted from the object and the node will become  not analyzed New configuration object(s) can be added (including wildcards). The item will become  not analyzed .  If the new added object falls into an existing tree, only the subtree is affected. Existing interface SceUpdateObjectInfo is used to save the editing. Database changes Must add another column to the analysis result table for the original object name that analysis of the object is based on). This link is set as the primary key which is used to query all mismatch objects under a given configuration object. The column defined as below: OrignalName, BINARY type, 1024 Bytes, must not be NULL. Key: OriginalName=OriginalName+Name Since there is a table change, any old database with analysis information shouldn t be allowed to open. This is controlled by a version #. No data migration is needed. For old databases, all it needs is to re-analyze with the configuration information in the database. Structure Changes Existing structures for objects can be used. Interface Changes ScepObjectNameDefined ScepObjectNameDefined( IN PWSTR ObjectName,  IN PWSTR WildcardName This function matches an object name with an object name or wildcard object name. This is used when configuring objects under a given container to determine if the inherited security from its parent should be used, or explicitly defined security from the configuration should be used. In Windows 2000, this is done by string comparing the object names. But since we are going to support wildcard names, an individual object name could match a wildcard object name. SceQueryObject/ SceFreeEnumHandle #define SCE_OBJECT_FILTER_SD               #define SCE_OBJECT_QUERY_ALL       SCESTATUS SceQueryObject( IN PVOID  hProfile, IN SCETYPE  ProfileType, IN AREA_INFORMATION  Area, IN PWSTR  StringFilter OPTIONAL, IN DWORD  dwQueryFlag, IN OUT PVOID  *EnumHandle, OUT PSCE_OBJECT_CHILDREN *Buffer This function is used to query (w/ optional filter) objects defined in the configuration or analysis results (mismatched objects) in the analysis table. ProfileType determines which table to get information from the database (hProfile) and Area determines if registry section or file section should be queried.  For configuration information (SCE_ENGINE_SMP), the filter can be an object name or prefix, or a security descriptor string (for example, query for all objects allow every full control  (A;CIOI;GA;;;WD) ). If the filter is a security descriptor string, SCE_OBJECT_FILTER_SD bit must be specified in dwQueryFlag; otherwise, filter is treated as object name prefix if it s not NULL. For analysis information query (SCE_ENGINE_SAP), the filter can be a configuration object name (may contain wildcard) for which mismatched children are queried. If the filter field is NULL and SCE_OBJECT_QUERY_ALL is defined, all mismatched children under the section are returned. This function also supports multiple enumerations for the case when the number of objects is too big to be returned in one call. If there are more pending objects for the same filter, SCESTATUS_SUCCESS is returned, with a EnumHandle. The EnumHandle must be used for further calls. When the enumeration is done, the EnumHandle must be closed by SceFreeEnumHandle. SCESTATUS SceFreeEnumHandle(IN PVOID EnumHandle); Remove SceGetObjectChildren This interface is replaced by SceQueryObject. SceUpdateObjectInfo The prototype of this interface is not changed but the logic of this interface in engine is changed (simplified). This function will save the updated information to the configuration object record and delete all mismatched children resulted from the old configuration info. The analysis status of this object becomes  not analyzed Notes for UI Based on the analysis information returned from engine, UI can arrange the data into different views. In this version, we should at least support the following views Partial Tree View for objects This view is the main view we will support. All configuration objects will be first displayed in a flat list, with match/mismatch status plus optional number of mismatches under each object. When an object is expanded, all mismatched children under the objects are presented in either flat view or tree view format. Please note that all children under here are determined  mismatched  based on the configuration information of the object (directly or indirectly).  Same question here: if all drives/hives are to be analyzed even if they are not defined in the configuration, how are they displayed in this view ? Flat Analysis View for objects This view format lists all mismatched objects in a flat list. Later one, this view could be extended to allow query and filter. This view could also break the limit of the AREA concept and list all mismatched items (including policies and etc) in a one flat list.  Analysis summary could also be provided at this view. Support SMB Security   File Server In order to secure file server, LanManServer/Rdr related security settings must be configured/analyzed in SCTS. Some of the settings are already configured in  Security Options  node in Windows 2000. We need to support the full security settings described in the requirement spec (scodyssey.doc). In summary, the features to support for SMB security: Default DACL for new shares Allow Power Users to create shares Make share security equal NTFS security Remove all non auto-admin shares Remove all non auto-admin/CD shares Remove all auto admin shares Named pipes which can be accessed anonymously Shares which can be accessed anonymously EnableSecuritySignature RequireSecuritySignature Amount of idle time required before disconnecting a session Hide server from browsing lists RequireEnhancedChallengeResponse SendNTResponseOnly RestrictNullSessAccess Implementation Design Remove SMB Extension Remove the extension structure for SMB server.  SMB security should be implemented within the core engine rather than as an extension. New Structures Define structures for SMB settings typedef struct SCE_SHARES_ {     PWSTR ShareName;     DWORD Flag;  //1 = admin share; 2 = CD shares; 3 = non auto-admin shares     struct SCE_SHARES_ *Next; } SCE_SHARES, *PSCE_SHARES; typedef struct SCESHARE_SECURITY_ {     PWSTR ShareName;     PWSTR FilePath;     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR pShareSecurity;     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR pFileSecurity;     DWORD Status;     struct SCESHARE_SECURITY *Next; } SCESHARE_SECURITY, *PSCESHARE_SECURITY; typedef struct _SCESMB_INFO_ {     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR pDefaultSD;     BYTE AllowPowerUsersCreateShare;     BYTE ShareACLSameWithNTFS;     PSCESHARE_SECURITY pDifferentACLShares;  // analysis only     BYTE RemoveShares;  // 0x1   remove non auto-admin shares // 0x2   remvoe auto-admin shares // 0x4   remove non auto-admin/CD shares     PSCE_SHARES pExceptionShares; // analysis only     PWSTR NullSessionPipes;  //MULTI-SZ type     PWSTR NullSessionShares; // MULTI-SZ type     BYTE EnableSecuritySignature;     BYTE RequireSecuritySignature;     DWORD AutoDisconnect;     BYTE HideServer;     BYTE RequireECR;     BYTE SendNTResponseOnly;     BYTE RestrictNullSessionAccess;  } SCESMB_INFO, *PSCESMB_INFO; Link the SMB info structure (PSCESMB_INFO) into PSCE_PROFILE_INFO structure typedef struct SCE_PROFILE_INFO_ { PSCESMB_INFO pSmbInfo; Define a new INF section.

For analysis result table, there are two more read only SMB settings, one is the list of shares that have different security than NTFS, the other is the list of shares that are not removed.  The first setting is only analyzed when flag ShareACLSameWithNTFS is set to 1 and file system is NTFS. The analysis result of this setting is stored under key  DifferentACLShares  and all shares are stored in multi-sz format and info for one share is stored in the sequence of  ShareName, NTFSPath, ShareSecurity,NTFSSecurity The second setting is only analyzed when flag  RemoveShares  is set. The analysis result of this setting is stored under key  RemainingShares  and all shares are stored in multi-sz format. Each share is stored in the sequence of  ShareName,ShareType Area Redefinition More security areas are covered by SCTS, for example, SMB security or print security. They are not necessarily related to services. To make SCTS engine consistent with UI display and be expandable, the AREA_INFORMATION is redefined as follows: #define AREA_PASSWORD_POLICY 0x0001 #define AREA_ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT 0x0002 #define AREA_KERBEROS_POLICY 0x0004 #define AREA_AUDIT_POLICY 0x0008 #define AREA_PRIVILEGES 0x0010 #define AREA_REGISTRY_VALUES 0x0020 #define AREA_EVENT_LOGS 0x0040 #define AREA_FILE_SECURITY 0x0080 #define AREA_REGISTRY_KEYS 0x0100 #define AREA_SYSTEM_SERVICES 0x0200 #define AREA_FILE_SHARING 0x0400 #define AREA_PRINT_SECURITY 0x0800 #define AREA_EXTENSIONS 0x8000 New Functions The SMB security settings will be handled within AREA_FILE_SHARING so existing exported APIs can be used to query/save the info. Define private functions to handle read/write SMB info from/to security templates as well as Jet databases. Functions to configure and analyze SMB settings are also needed (invoked by the main SCTS configuration / analysis engine).  Define SceInfpGetSmbInfo to read SMB settings from an INF template. This function is called in SceInfpGetSecurityProfileInfo when AREA_FILE_SHARING is requested SCESTATUS SceInfpGetSmbInfo(     IN HINF  hInf,     OUT PSCESMB_INFO * ppSmbInfo,     OUT PSCE_ERROR_LOG_INFO *Errlog OPTIONAL     ); Define SceInfpWriteSmbInfo to write SMB settings to an INF template.

This function is called in ScepAnalyzeStart when AREA_FILE_SHARING is requested. When flag ShareACLSameWithNTFS is set to 1 and file system is NTFS, all shares will be enumerated and their security is compared with NTFS security. If any one share has different security than NTFS, the share is stored to  DifferentACLShares  in the analysis result table. When flag RemoveShares is set, depending on the value of the flag, all admin/non admin shares are enumerated and stored to  RemainingShares  in the analysis result table.

This function is called in ScepConfigureSystem when AREA_FILE_SHARING is requested. When flag  ShareACLSameWithNTFS  is set, this function should first check if the file system is NTFS. If it s not NTFS system, the flag is ignored. Otherwise, query security from NTFS and set the same security to the share. SCESTATUS ScepConfigureSmbInfo(     IN PSCESMB_INFO pSmbInfo     ); Define ScepUpdateSmbInfo to update SMB settings (changes from UI).

This should be just mechanic works to replace old area information with the new definitions. Note, this change should be cooperated with UI and cmd tool (since both tools request info and invoke tasks based on area information). Notes for UI Scope Pane Changes Define a new node  File Sharing  for SMB settings in the top level hierarchy. The new node belongs to AREA_FILE_SHARING.  Result Pane Changes In the result pane of  File Sharing  node, all SMB settings described above are displayed in the flat scope. Support Print Security   Print Server In order to secure print server, spooler related security settings must be configured/analyzed in SCTS. In summary, the features to support for spooler security: Remove all Print Shares Default DACL for new printers (this is hardcoded in spooler??) (Existing) Printer Security   no add/remove printer is supported Secure spool directory Prevent users from installing printers Load print drivers from trusted server only Server to load print driver (dependency) Web-based printer Hide printers Automatically publish new printers in Active Directory Allow printers to be published Implementation Design New Structures Define structures for spooler settings Typedef struct _SCEPRINT_SECURITY_INFO_ {     PWSTR PrinterName;     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR pPrinterSD;     DWORD Status;     Struct SCEPRINT_SECURITY_INFO *Next; } SCEPRINT_SECURITY, *PSCEPRINT_SECURITY; typedef struct _SCEPRINT_INFO_ {     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR pDefaultSD;     BYTE RemoveAllPrintShares;     PSCE_SHARES pRemaingShares; // analysis only     BYTE SecureSpoolDirectory; // default (secure) DACL is hardcoded ??

Should be able to handle database upgrade   if spooler section doesn t exist, it should be added dynamically in order to handle upgrade from Windows 2000. For analysis result table, there is a read only spooler setting - the list of print shares that are not removed. This setting is only analyzed when flag RemoveAllPrintShares is set to 1. The analysis result of this setting is stored under key  RemainingPrintShares  and all shares are stored in multi-sz format.  New Functions The spooler security settings will be handled within AREA_PRINT_SECURITY so existing exported APIs can be used to query/save the info. Define private functions to handle read/write spooler info from/to security templates as well as Jet databases. Functions to configure and analyze spooler settings are also needed (invoked by the main SCTS configuration / analysis engine).  Define SceInfpGetPrintInfo to read spooler settings from an INF template.

This function is called in ScepAnalyzeStart when AREA_PRINT_SECURITY is requested. When flag RemoveAllPrintShares is set to 1, all print shares will be enumerated and stored to  RemainingPrintShares  in the analysis result table. When flag  SecureSpoolDirectory  is set to 1, the spool directory (queried from registry) and its all subdirectories/files will be analyzed with the default (secure) DACL (hardcoded?). If there is any difference, the spool directory is treated not secure and this flag in analysis result table is set. Note that if the spool directory is configured in file system section, it will have different security than the default DACL but it may not be unsecure. SCESTATUS ScepAnalyzePrintInfo(     IN PSCECONTEXT hProfile,     IN PSCEPRINT_INFO pPrintInfo     ); Define ScepConfigurePrintInfo to configure spooler settings with the configuration info. This function is called in ScepConfigureSystem when AREA_PRINT_SECURITY is requested. When flag  RemoveAllPrintShares  is set, all print shares will be enumerated and deleted. When flag  SecureSpoolDirectory  is set, first this function queries the spool directory from registry then set the default DACL to this directory and all of sub-directories/files. Note, if the spool directory is also configured in file system security section with a different DACL, depends on which section is executed first, one of them will not work as expected (overwritten by the last write). SCESTATUS ScepConfigurePrintInfo(     IN PSCEPRINT_INFO pPrintInfo     ); Define ScepUpdatePrintInfo to update spooler settings (changes from UI).

The new nodes belong to AREA_PRINT_SECURITY.  Result Pane Changes In the result pane of  Print Sharing  node, all general print settings described above are displayed in the flat scope. In the result pane of  Printer Permissions  node, all printers with their permissions are displayed. Support IIS Security   Web Server IIS security is supported in IIS extension of SCTS. As an extension, it follows the spec for SCTS attachments, namely, it has an engine to configure/analyze/update IIS related security; it also has an UI to display/manage IIS security aspects. IIS engine is invoked by SCTS engine via well-known interfaces. IIS UI is expanded under SCTS UI ( Extensions  node) when the node is expanded. IIS UI communicates with SCTS UI for querying/setting information. SCTS UI then passes the information/requests to SCTS engine. SCTS engine then invokes IIS engine for the detail processing. The attachment framework is already defined in Windows 2000 but there is no real attachment implemented and there are some known bugs with the framework. In Odyssey, the attachment framework should be refined, with IIS extension as the first attachment in production. IIS security is only a portion of web server security. This extension focuses on IIS metabase security. For a secure web server, security aspects of the OS and other components (such as TCP) should also be configured. These aspects will be discussed in the TCP extension and in core SCTS feature enhancements (later).  Implementation Design   IIS Extension Engine: IIS extension engine will be registered as  SceIISSecurity  so this will also be the section name in INF templates and JET databases. For FTP service, the following settings will be configured/analyzed in IIS extension: Any virtual directory permission (Permission) - any level Logging (AllowLogging) - any level Log format (LogFormat) - svc,site,root level only Restrict sites (IP address) to users (RestrictIP) - any level  Connection timeout (ConnectionTimeout) - svc and site level only  RemoveVirtualDirectory (RemoveDirectory) - any level  Remove script mappings (RemoveScriptMappings) - any level  Analyze log for attack (AttackKeywords) - any level Allow Anonymous FTP (AllowAnonymous) - svc, site level only Anonymous FTP only (AnonymousOnly) - svc, site level only For W3C service, the following settings will be configured/analyzed in IIS extension: Authentication Method (AuthMethod)  - any level Any virtual directory permission (Permission) - any level Logging (AllowLogging) - any level Log format (LogFormat) - svc,site,root level only Restrict sites (IP address) to users (RestrictIP) - any level Connection timeout (ConnectionTimeout) - svc and site level only Server only indexing (AllowServerIndex) - any level except virtual file RemoveVirtualDirectory (RemoveDirectory) - any level Remove script mappings (RemoveScriptMappings) - any level Analyze log for attack (AttackKeywords) - any level Disable IP address in content location (DisableIPContent)   svc, site level only Disable parent path (DisableParentPath) - any level Disable #exec (DisableExecInclude) - any level Allow HTTP keep alive (AllowKeepAlive) - svc and site level only Types This section explains all FTP and W3C settings and their value types/ranges. The value type and range will determine how these settings are stored in INF/JET and how should UI display these settings. Some of the settings are only analyzable (not configurable). Value Name Value Type Value Range Comment AuthMethod Number 1,2,3 1 - AuthAnonymous  2 - AuthBasic 3 - AuthNTLM Permission String SDDL string Must use IIS defined access mask flags AllowLogging Number 0 or 1 t log LogFormat String (MULTI-SZ) Log field names separated by comma Log field names must be IIS pre-defined RestrictIP ConnectionTimeout Number In minutes AllowServerIndex Number 0 or 1 t allow  allow indexing RemoveDirectory Number 0 or 1 t remove  remove RemoveScriptMappings Number 0 or 1 t remove  remove AttackKeywords String (MULTI-SZ) Keywords separated by comma, such as msadcs This is a analysis only setting DisableIPContent Number 0 or 1 t disable  disable DisableParentPath Number 0 or 1 t disable  disable DisableExecInclude Number 0 or 1 t disable  disable AllowKeepAlive Number 0 or 1 t allow   allow keep alive AllowAnonymous Number 0 or 1 t allow  allow AnonymousOnly Number 0 or 1  allow non anonymous   only anonymous INF/JET layout All IIS metabase security information is stored in one section in object hierarchy layout, as registry keys. The root of each object could be public/, private/, default/, or a site name (e.g., microsoft.com). Following the root name, FTP or WWW are used to differenciate security settings for FTP service or W3C service. Then the virtual directory/file path follows. The real security setting name follows the virtual path, separated with a  [SceIISSecurity] public/WWW/AuthMethod = 1 or 2 or 3 public/WWW/Permission = <SDDL string> private/FTP/AllowAnonymous = 0 or 1 Private/FTP/root/AttackKeywords = <keywords separated by ,> microsoft.com/WWW/root/scripts/RemoveScriptMappings = 0 or 1 Structures When above settings are queried via SCTS engine, the settings are returned in the general attachment buffer (array of Key and Value, defined in scesvc.h). Since IIS settings apply to IIS virtual directories/files in metabase and structure of the metabase is just like registry (keys and values), the buffer returned from SCTS engine must be re-arranged into object hierarchy in order to configure/analyze. IIS metabase interfaces/APIs handle inheritance of attributes. Attributes set on a top level parent will bet automatically propagated to all of its children. So for configuration, attributes should be configured in top-down order for the objects specified in the configuration template. Order doesn t matter for analysis but all metabase objects should be analyzed to determine status of  match/mismatch/not defined. Note, virtual directory names could also contain wildcard (*). When rearranging the buffer (for configuration/analysis), the wildcards will be expanded to map to the real metabase objects. One configuration may map to multiple analysis. For example, wildcard objects, or the public/private templates that are applied to all public/private sites. The question is how to do the mappings between one configuration and multiple analysis?

Notes for IIS Extension UI: The above attributes could be configured to a virtual directory/file for W3C or FTP services. These settings should be presented on property sheet(s) for one profile. The profile then can be applied to one or more sites/virtual directories/files. For example, on the high level view, it s a list of security profiles: <public web site security profile> <private web site security profile> <Microsoft.com security profile> Double click (or right click Property) on any of the profiles to bring up its property, which contains the above attributes (may require multiple sheets since they have different types and groups). Besides the attributes, UI should also present a radio button for the type of profile and two edit boxes, one for the optional virtual dir/file name and the other for the description of a profile: All public sites All private sites Virtual Object Name:  <Edit Box> Profile Description: <Edit Box> Support TCP/IP Security   Web Server Unbind Netbios from tcpip - Tcp/ip ext Disable IP routing - Tcp/ip ext Configure tcpip filtering  (TCP/UDP/IP ports) - Tcp/ip ext Unbind client for Microsoft Network from all adapters - Tcp/ip ext Bind TCP/IP only - Tcp/ip ext Configure static ip address/submask/gateway/DNS server or DHCP - Tcp/ip ext LMHOSTS lookup - Tcp/ip ext Remove optional components (add/remove programs) - Tcp/ip ext ?

IOCTL_TCP_BLOCK_PORTS, NtDeviceIoControlFile, ntddtcp.h, ntos\io\netboot.c There are over 30 registry values defined in  HYPERLINK "file://nttest/ntct/slm/src/tcp/documentation/attack_protection/regkey_protection.htm"  \\nttest\ntct\slm\src\tcp\documentation\attack_protection\regkey_protection.htm Snapshot System Security This feature is to provide rollback data that can be used to restore security on the entire system. Due to a limitation in setupapi handling INF files (max 7M), a Jet database is used to store the snapshot data. In Phase I, the data can t be copied/used on other machines because the data contains machine specific information (such as machine SID and specific NTFS layout). In phase II, portability of snapshot data will be supported. All security areas supported in SCTS should be under snapshot. In file system and registry areas, all files/keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_USERS\Default should be snapshot.  In Phase I, UI won t support the snapshot database to view/modify the data. In Phase II, UI can be used to view/modify the exported templates from the snapshot database. So there is no UI change for this task in both phases. Implementation Options Snapshot explicit only ACEs of NTFS files and registry keys. This may give us possible less objects to store in the database and use the same analysis view (everything is considered matched!) and configuration mechanism. The limitation of this method is that inherited security information on objects can t be viewed (an existing bug in Windows 2000 for any analysis data). Any new files/keys added after the snapshot with protected security descriptor will be overwritten to inherit the parent s security descriptor. But this option allows modification to the snapshot database (no difference with other private databases). Snapshot all ACEs (inherited & explicit) of NTFS files and registry keys and store all objects in the database.  The benefit of this option is to be able to view inherited information. But this requires a new engine method to query/merge the data, a new configuration engine mode to stamp security onto each object, and a new analysis engine mode to compare security of each object. Any new files/keys added after the snapshot with protected security descriptor won t be overwritten in this option. This option shouldn t allow modifications to the database. Based on the complexity/benefit of option 2, we decide to use option 1 and the snapshot database is not viewable/modifiable. Snapshot data can only be viewed after it s exported into a INF template. Phase I The issues in phase-I are: 1) choosing the right option for snapshot 2) handling errors in snapshot. Errors occurred in snapshot (such as files in use or access is denied) will be logged in a log file. The object(s) won t be saved in the snapshot database. This implies that security of these objects will be overwritten by inherited security from its parent(s). Database Change Database structure   add a column   into system table to indicate the database is a snapshot database   SCE_DB_SNAPSHOT Provide an appropriate database description: Security snapshot at mm/dd/yy hh:mm New Interfaces Provide an API ScepGetProfileType to query if it s a snapshot database. This function will be called when a database is requested to open. A snapshot database can t be opened by UI. SCESTATUS ScepGetDatabaseType( IN PVOID hProfile,  OUT SCEDBTYPE *pDbType); Provide an API SceSnapshotSystem to snapshot the entire system into a database. Security of an object includes only explicit ACEs.  The snapshot of security will be saved in the analysis table (SAP). For account domain accounts (non builtin nor well-known) in user rights, group membership, and SDDL strings, account names should be saved rather than the account SID (which has machine SID).  Note this function requires that SDDL APIs to support account names. SCESTATUS SceSnapshotSystem(     IN LPTSTR SystemName OPTIONAL,     IN PCWSTR DatabaseName,     IN PCWSTR LogFileName OPTIONAL,     IN DWORD Options,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area,     IN PSCE_AREA_CALLBACK_ROUTINE pCallback OPTIONAL,     IN HANDLE hCallbackWnd OPTIONAL,     OUT PDWORD pdWarning OPTIONAL     ); Interface Changes No import/export (into INF template in phase I) are allowed into/from this database. Command Tool  secedit.exe  Changes Provide an option to snapshot a system. Required parameters are /db. Optional parameters are /areas, /log, and /verbose. Phase II In Phase II, the following functions should be supported: Exported configuration should be system independent (environment variable support) Export into one or more INF templates (wildcard support, multiple templates support) Machine Independent This function includes 1) converting machine name to %ComputerName% or %DomainName% for any account name (in SDDL, user rights, and groups). 2) converting file system paths to use generic system environment variables. This is required in order for the snapshot data to be used on other systems (to make other systems in the same configuration as this one). Note, the accounts are already saved in name format by the analysis engine. Object Groups (Wildcard) In the nature of Windows 2000, a lot of system files share the same kind of security settings (such as Admin/System full control, everyone Read). To list each object with the same security setting in the same template not only increases the size of the configuration template/table, it also slows down processing time (when calculating inherited security information for every object).  In Phase II, we will try to group objects with same security settings together, represented by some wildcard names, such as *.dll, *.exe. This is hard in some degree because it reverses the wildcard name process to map many into one. Implementation of the Export Function Importing template is not supported for snapshot databases. Exporting from the snapshot database is a special function because it needs to do the machine independent task and the wildcard task, as well as be able to export into multiple templates.  The latter task is due to the limitation of INF files in which we store the security configuration, and the size of snapshot data. Fixup  the data The first step of the new export function is to determine if the snapshot data has been  fixed  this is done via looking at the configuration table (SMP). Since all snapshot data (RAW) is saved in SAP, SMP table is empty if  fixup  hasn t been run. The fixup function will reverse the environment variable support and machine name mappings. Account names will be compared with computer name or domain name to decide if %ComputerName% or %DomainName% should be used. To reverse mapping of environment variables, %SystemDirectory% and %SystemRoot% are first compared, followed by standard environment variables in the order of longest to shortest. The fixed data will be saved in the configuration table (SMP) Wildcard grouping Assumption:  The wildcard grouping is only done at the leaf node level. This is done together with the  fixup  function. Multiple Templates When data exported is over a limit (for example 4M), new template(s) should be created to continue the exportation. One option is that engine creates the template automatically, using the same template name followed by a sequence number (such as 001,002,003,etc). Another option is to provide the number of templates required and take the template names beforehand. Both options can also be supported with a flag. This function requires a new interface SceGetExportTemplateCount and changes to SceSetupGenerateTemplate and SceCopyBaseProfile. DWORD WINAPI SceGetExportTemplateCount(     IN LPTSTR SystemName OPTIONAL,     IN LPTSTR JetDbName OPTIONAL,     IN BOOL bFromMergedTable,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area,     OUT DWORD *Count     ); DWORD WINAPI SceSetupGenerateTemplate(     IN LPTSTR SystemName OPTIONAL,     IN LPTSTR JetDbName OPTIONAL,     IN BOOL bFromMergedTable,     IN LPTSTR *InfTemplateNameList,     IN DWORD TemplateCount,     IN LPTSTR LogFileName OPTIONAL,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area     ); SCESTATUS WINAPI SceCopyBaseProfile(     IN PVOID hProfile,     IN SCETYPE ProfileType,     IN PWSTR *InfFileNameList,     IN DWORD TemplateCount,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area,     OUT PSCE_ERROR_LOG_INFO *pErrlog OPTIONAL     ); A new  Export  option for secedit.exe This export function will do the above conversion at export time. Remote Management This is required in order to support remote administration of security settings (such as user rights).  Please note that RPC data structures are changed (for other features such as Restricted Group/User Right enhancement) so remotely managing machines in old builds should be handled correctly.  SCTS version should be checked before performing any remote task. Implementation Design Since local policy is removed (in section 1), there is no need to handle remote policy refresh and effective policy refresh.  Remote Validation After a SCTS client connects to a SCTS server, before making any RPC calls, the SCTS client should call ScepIsRemoteCompatible to check if the remote server supports the client version. For old systems (Windows 2000 or below), this interface doesn t exist and the exception calling this interface should be handled. ScepIsRemoteCompatible( IN BINDING_H bBinding OPTIONAL, IN LPTSTR SystemName OPTIONAL This function queries the local code number of SCTS and passes the number over a RPC interface, as defined below. SceRpcIsRemoteCompatible( IN BINDING_H hBinding, IN localVersion // the local code version (could use build number) Interface Changes Change the following interfaces to add  SystemName  parameter: SceOpenProfile SceCreateDirectory SceEnumerateServices SceSvcConvertTextToSD SceSvcConvertSDToText SceIsSystemDatabase Define new RPC interfaces: SceRpcCreateDirectory SceRpcEnumerateServices SceSvcRpcConvertTextToSD SceSvcRpcConvertSDToText SceRpcIsSystemDatabase Change RPC binding to bind to the right system based on the SystemName parameter. Add logic to determine if the  SystemName  is the local computer to avoid network traffic. Remove LPC bindings to use RPC bindings Notes for UI Get computer name of the machine where local policy editor or computer management points to, and save the computer name with this instance of UI (note, there might be multiple instances of security settings snap-in running simultaneously). Pass the computer name to appropriate SCTS engine APIs Perform user right display name lookup on the remote computer (GetRightsDisplayName). Query/store UI state/configuration from/to the remote registry or local registry (using remote registry apis)   e.g. security options Service Pack/Hotfix Analysis This feature is to provide user information about the machine regarding what service pack is it running and what hotfixes have been applied (on top of the service pack). Since this is  read-only  information, it doesn t fit into the SCTS category that must be configurable and analyzable through SCTS. The design then is to analyze and save the information during a system analysis. Implementation Options Save the information in the analysis log file, if there is one provided. This requires engine change only. Save the information to the system table (read only) within each database. This requires both engine and UI change (UI should display the info somewhere) but the benefit is that the information would be kept together with each analysis database. Implementation Changes During system analyze initialization (after database is initialized/opened), perform analysis for the service pack info and hotfix info: Query build # and service pack # by calling GetVersionEx (or querying registry values under HKLM\software\Microsoft\windows nt\currentversion, CurrentBuildNumber, CSDVersion). Query hotfix applied to the service pack   enumerate all subkeys under KLM\software\Microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\hotfix. For a given subkey, if registry value  Installed  (REG_DWORD) has a value 0x1 and registry value  Service Pack  has the same value as the service pack number queried in #1, the hotfix is installed for the service pack and should be logged. Data format: All data will be concatenated into one line: Build # [Service pack x] [Hot Fixes a,b,c ] If no service pack or hot fix  applied, the information won t be saved. Define appropriate strings for localization builds  Build Service Pack Hot Fixes Choose storage:  for option 1, log the info to the log file for option 2, define a new string field  SP info  in the system table. Notes for UI (Option 2 only): For option 2 where SP info is saved in the analysis database, UI needs to display the info to users. Where should this info be exposed? A summary page is one option here.  Database-less Operation As it is designed in Windows 2000, a database is required for configuration/analysis (as the workspace and storage). The database concept is confusing in some cases such as configuring a system with a template and that s all users cared. This feature is to hide the database concept from users. Instead of prompting users to choose a database to work with, each user will always have one hidden working database, in addition to the system database. The hidden database will be stored in a dedicated SCTS directory on each machine, with user s SID string as a subdirectory name. The proposed location for the hidden database is %systemdrive%\SCTSSecurityDb\ <user SID string>. The proposed database name is ScaWork.sdb. When remotely connect to a machine to configure, the hidden database should be located on the remote machine (because Jet engine on the remote machine may not be able to write the database back to this machine). This requires all database names to be resolved in server. The reason not to use user profile location is to handle remote case above   when a user launched a SCTS task remotely but this user hasn t logged on to this machine in which case there won t be a user profile for the user. Database parameter to the interfaces is still needed because it can be used to debug users databases. It will also be required if an admin choose to browse information in other databases in the future. Passing a NULL as the database name allows engine to figure out the hidden database to use. For the system database, a flag SCE_SYSTEM_DB should be passed to the server. Implementation Design Exported Interface Changes Define a set of new functions SceGetHiddenDatabaseName, SceRpcGetHiddenDatabaseName, and ScepGetHiddenDatabaseName to find out the hidden database name based on the current logon user. This function could be the modified version of ScepGetProfileSetting/ ScepGetDefaultDatabase. SCESTATUS SceGetHiddenDatabaseName(IN LPTSTR SystemName,                                                    IN BOOL bSystemDb,                                                   OUT LPTSTR *pDbName); SCESTATUS SceRpcGetHiddenDatabaseName(IN BOOL bSystemDb,                                                        OUT LPTSTR *pDbName); SCESTATUS ScepGetHiddenDatabaseName(IN BOOL bSystemDb,                                                   OUT LPTSTR *pDbName); Change callers to ScepGetProfileSetting/ScepGetDefaultDatabase to either call ScepGetHiddenDatabaseName, or reconsider the scenarios. server.cpp setupcln.cpp   ScepSetupOpenSecurityDatabase  setup case and optional component case (outside of setup). Should reject non admins to access system db. Redefine SCE_FORMAT_TYPE to allow bitmask (remove type define for SCE_FORMAT_TYPE to use a DWORD bitmask) #define   SCE_INF_FORMAT #define   SCE_JET_FORMAT #define   SCE_JET_ANALYSIS_REQUIRED #define   SCE_JET_SYSTEM SCESTATUS WINAPI SceOpenProfile(     IN PCWSTR ProfileName OPTIONAL, // for the system database     IN DWORD dwFormatRequired,     OUT PVOID *hProfile     ); INF format template is not affected by this change. When opening a Jet database, if the database name is NULL and SCE_JET_FORMAT is specified, the database will be figured out by SCE engine. If SCE_JET_SYSTEM is included and admin is logged on, the system database is used; otherwise, the hidden database is  computed  based on the current logon user. Remove DatabaseName from the following exported APIs (client site) and pass NULL as the database name to server (where the correct database name will be figured) SceAnalyzeSystem SceConfigureSystem Change SceSetupGenerateTemplate to include SYSTEM_DB flag as an option: #define SCE_EXPORT_MERGE_POLICY DWORD WINAPI SceSetupGenerateTemplate(     IN LPTSTR SystemName OPTIONAL,     IN LPTSTR JetDbName OPTIONAL,     IN DWORD dwExportOption,     IN LPTSTR InfTemplateName,     IN LPTSTR LogFileName OPTIONAL,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area     ) When JetDbName is NULL and an admin is logged on, if dwExportOption contains SYSTEM_DB bit, the system database is used; otherwise, the hidden database for the current user is used. If JetDbName is passed in but it points to the system database name and the current logon doesn t belong to Administrators group, the hidden database will be used too. Change SceBrowseDatabaseTable  to include SYSTEM_DB flag as an option: #define SCE_BROWSE_DOMAIN_POLICY SCESTATUS SceBrowseDatabaseTable(     IN PWSTR       DatabaseName OPTIONAL,     IN SCETYPE     ProfileType,     IN AREA_INFORMATION Area,     IN DWORD  dwBrowseOption,     IN PSCE_BROWSE_CALLBACK_ROUTINE pCallback OPTIONAL     ); When DatabaseName is NULL and dwBrowseOption contains SCE_SYSTEM_DB, the system database is used; otherwise, the hidden database is used. RPC Interface Changes Allows system flag to be passed in as a bit in the option field  DWORD SceRpcGenerateTemplate(     IN handle_t binding_h,     IN wchar_t *JetDbName OPTIONAL,     IN DWORD dwOption,     IN wchar_t *LogFileName OPTIONAL,     OUT SCEPR_CONTEXT __RPC_FAR *pContext     ); SCEPR_STATUS SceRpcOpenDatabase(     [in] handle_t       binding_h,     [in,string,unique] wchar_t *DatabaseName,     [in] DWORD dwOpenOption,     [out] SCEPR_CONTEXT *pContext     ); SCEPR_STATUS SceRpcBrowseDatabaseTable(     [in] handle_t      binding_h,     [in,string,unique] wchar_t *DatabaseName,     [in] SCEPR_TYPE ProfileType,     [in] AREAPR Area,     [in] DWORD dwBrowseOption     ); Add logic to the RPC interfaces that take database name as an argument to determine if the system database, the hidden database, or the explicitly specified database should be used. Please note that the system database should only allow administrators to open (until UI supports read only mode for a normal user to view system settings). SceRpcGenerateTemplate SceRpcConfigureSystem SceRpcOpenDatabase SceRpcAnalyzeSystem SceRpcBrowseDatabaseTable SceRpcIsSystemDatabase SCE Server Logic Changes Do not allow Jet to recover user databases by setting the Jet recovery bit off for non-system database. This is required to handle if the path to user database or the database itself is deleted. Change places currently uses SCE_SYSTEM_DB flag: server.cpp, review config.cpp and analyze.cpp ScepGetDefaultDatabase Remove code to query  DefaultProfile  registry value. The system database as well as users  hidden databases will not be stored in registry anymore. Database Changes Database info clean up: Configuration/Analysis with a template name and without SCE_NO_CONFIG option will always assume SCE_OVERWRITE_DB, which means that the database is recreated with the template info first. When importing multiple templates (with SCE_NO_CONFIG option), the first template should have SCE_OVERWRITE_DB option to clean existing data in the database. Then other templates can be appended to the database (with SCE_APPEND_DB mode) Recode the imported template(s) in the description field in the system table. For single template, the template name should be saved before the description (appended). For multiple templates, the list of template names is stored in the field. Command Tool  secedit.exe Hide /db option (to be used with the hidden /browse option only) Provide a list of templates to configure/analyze /cfg file1 [,file2,file3 The first template (file1) is imported to the database with SCE_OVERWRITE_DB option while the rest of templates are imported into the database with SCE_APPEND_DB option. After the last template is imported, appropriate configuration/analysis task will be invoked. Notes for UI Remove global variable  SadName  and pass NULL as the database name to all engine APIs. For system database, pass SCE_JET_SYSTEM as one of the open type. Remove  Open database  from Security Configuration & Analysis tool. When the root node is clicked, call SceOpenProfile automatically with NULL database name. Import  should allow importing a single template or a list of templates. For a single template or the first template in the list, SCE_OVERWRITE_DB should be passed to engine; otherwise, SCE_APPEND_DB should be passed to engine. If database name is requested somewhere, call SceGetHiddenDatabaseName. To get the template or the list of templates imported into the database, call SceGetScpProfileDescription. The template name(s) will be stored in the description field. Code Independent Upgrade Scenarios In Windows 2000, security configured in setup is hard-linked into setup/dcpromo and security templates/group configuration for various products are also hard-coded. Progress indicator during security setup is not displayed friendly (at one point it  freezes  for 3 minutes on a PII 400 machine). Various security aspects are configured at different times. Security backup template doesn t contain all files (which may run into the INF size limitation). Security configured in dcpromo is not cancelable and a lot of hardcode exists for the special case of the new SAM not available.  This task is to make security configuration in setup smarter to remove the hard links mentioned above. Implementation Design Progress ticker Work with setup team (VijeshS) to provide callbacks to the following calls so we could post progress. Detail is to be determined. SceSetupBackupSecurity SceSetupConfigureServices Marta support Use marta GetNamedSecurityInfo to query security of an object so that NT4 style security descriptor can be handled properly. This is to support the   mode in SCTS   a bug fix. Security install template Define a new security install template to dynamically determine templates to apply and areas to apply within setup. This will remove the hardcode template names and hardcode group membership within setup.  [Clean Install]  ; choice of workstation or server InitialSecurity=defltxx.inf, areas ServiceSecurity=defltxx.inf, areas OCSecurity=syscomp.inf, areas DCSecurity=defltdc.inf, areas NT4DCSecurity=dcup.inf, areas [Upgrade NT4] ; wks/srv SnapshotSecurity=1 or 0, areas InitialSecurity=dxup.inf, areas ServiceSecurity=<a security template>, areas   ; currently none OCSecurity=syscomp.inf, areas [Upgrade NT5] ; wks/srv SnapshotSecurity=1 or 0, areas InitialSecurity=dxup.inf, areas ServiceSecurity=<a security template>, areas   ; currently none OCSecurity=syscomp.inf, areas [Upgrade DC] ;; must be NT5 DC because upgrade NT4 DC is treated as clean install server SnapshotSecurity=1 or 0, areas InitialSecurity=dcup5.inf, areas ServiceSecurity=<a security template>, areas  ; currently none OCSecurity=<a security template>,areas ; currently none [Upgrade TS] ;; terminal server upgrade SnapshotSecurity=1 or 0, areas InitialSecurity=dsupt.inf, areas ServiceSecurity=<a security template>, areas ; currently none OCSecurity=syscomp.,inf, areas Re-engineering dcpromo  TBD (dependency with DS group). This is to fix hard links between various components and make new SAM available during dcpromo (so account/policy change can be managed). SCTS should also be cancelable. Handle Domain Accounts in setup Since there is no network capability in setup, any domain accounts (or anything that goes off the network cable) can t be resolved. In Windows 2000 upgrade, SCTS didn t handle these accounts correctly in user right area if the system database already exists with domain accounts in name format (such as NT4 boxes with SCTS installed). We need to handle domain accounts properly in setup. If there is account in name format and can t be resolved in setup, don t remove the user rights. Instead, the user rights for nonresolvable accounts should be left alone. Backup system security When template is imported into the system database with append mode, existing configuration should be back ed up to the backup security template and removed from the system database before new template is imported. This rule applies to all areas except security policy and user rights area because info for these two areas becomes the local security policy after the system is installed. The configuration to backup must be appended to the existing backup security template using SceAppendSecurityProfileInfo.  PAGE  ~s~sgs~s~sgs~

ScAlert.exe: Smart Card Alert

ScAlert is a GUI tool that runs on Windows2000 and allows the user to monitor the status of the smart card system.

The smart card system in Windows2000 is made up of the smart card service, smart card readers, smart cards, and smart card drivers.  Becuase the smart card system provides little UI with which to interact, it can be difficult to troubleshoot the system.  By running ScAlert to view the status of the system, users can determine if their smart card readers are interacting correctly with the smart card system, if their smart cards are functioning, if the software drivers for the smart cards have been installed correctly, and what the current status of each smart card is.

It is important to note that leaving a smart card in a reader for an extended period of time will cause the chip on the card to overheat, which can result in failures of various operations.  In addition to displaying the status of smart cards, ScAlert notifies the user when a smart card has been left idle in a reader for 10 seconds or more.

NOTE: ScAlert will not run with the Microsoft Smart Card Base Components v1.0.

- installing ScAlert.exe -

ScAlert.exe can be run as-is.

In order to set a particular sound to be played by ScAlert when a card has become idle, run ScAlert.reg.  You may then set the sound for a "Smart Card Idle" event via the "Sounds and Multimedia" applet in the Control Panel.

- Using ScAlert.exe -

When ScAlert is run, it displays an icon in the system tray to indicate the following states:

	Smart Card System stopped.
	Smart Card System is running, but no cards are available.
	Smart Card System is running and has an available card.
	Smart Card System is running and has an idle card.

Right-clicking on the icon will bring up a menu with two items: Status and Close.  If the service is running, Status will be enabled.  Selecting Status will bring up a separate window that displays the readers available to the smart card system, their current status, and the name of any inserted cards.

From the Status window, the user may set their alert options, which will be saved when the application is closed.

notes: does not run with the Microsoft Smart Card Base Components v1.0.

1. Introduction
---------------

Welcome to the Version 1.0 release of the Microsoft Smart Card Base
Components.  This release provides the necessary files needed to enable
smart card aware application(s) or service provider(s) to communicate
with a smart card through a reader attached to a PC and its
corresponding device driver.

This software does not provide any smart card reader hardware or
drivers.  To obtain smart card readers, contact reader manufacturers
directly and request their PC/SC compliant reader and drivers for
Windows.


------------------------------------
2. Smart Card Base System Components
------------------------------------

The following components are included in this version of the release.

For Windows NT:

    %WINDIR%\system32\scardsvr.exe
    %WINDIR%\system32\scarddat.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\scarddlg.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\scardmgr.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\scardsrv.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\scntvssp.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\winscard.dll
    %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\smclib.sys

For Windows 95/98:

    %WINDIR%\system\scardsvr.exe
    %WINDIR%\system\scarddat.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\scarddlg.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\scardmgr.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\scardsrv.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\scntvssp.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\winscard.dll
    %WINDIR%\system\smclib.vxd
    %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\smclib.sys

The following support files may also be added to your system directory
as necessary:

    msvcrt.dll
    mfc42.dll
    advpack.dll


---------------
3. Installation
---------------

To install the Microsoft Smart Card Base Components on a target machine,
run SETUP.EXE from the root of disk 1 of the distribution medium.  After
installation of the Microsoft Smart Card Base Components and any smart
card reader device driver(s), the machine must be rebooted.

    Notes:

    This Setup utility installs smclib.sys to %WINDIR%\system32\drivers
    on both Windows 95 and Windows 98.  This file is not used on
    Windows 95, and may be safely ignored or removed without affecting
    the operation of the system.  It is required for correct operation
    on Windows 98.


------------
5. Uninstall
------------

To uninstall the Microsoft Smart Card Base Components go to the Control
Panel (under "Settings" on the Start menu) and start the "Add/Remove
Programs" applet.  Select "Microsoft Smart Card Base Components" from
the list of programs displayed in the scroll box and then click the
"Add/Remove" button. After uninstall of the Microsoft Smart Card Base
Components and any smart card reader device driver(s), the machine must
be rebooted.

    Notes:

    The smclib.sys and/or smclib.vxd common libraries used by the smart
    card reader drivers are not removed during uninstall.  This is
    because device drivers may still be installed in the system that
    depend on the smclib libraries to start and run.  The smclib.sys
    and/or smclib.vxd files may be safely removed after all smart card
    reader device drivers have been removed.

    The C Runtime and Microsoft Foundation Class files, msvcrt.dll and
    mfc42.dll, are not removed by the uninstall utility, since they are
    shared resources.

    The install utility may replace your advpack.dll system file.  The
    updated file is not removed by the uninstall utility.

---------------
5. Installation
---------------

To install the Win32 Smart Card SDK on a development machine, run
SETUP.EXE from the root of disk 1 of the distribution media. Before
running SETUP.EXE, the Win32 Platform SDK must be installed on the
target machine. The setup program will prompt for the installation
path. (The suggested path is your current %MSTOOLS% path: <YourDrive>:\SDK\...)

Along with the SDK, the system level components

    scardsvr.exe
    winscard.dll
    scarddlg.dll
    scarddat.dll
    scardmgr.dll
    scardsrv.dll
    scntvssp.dll

must be installed on your system. The system level components are
distributed separately from the SDK components. Refer to the README
for the system level components for information on how to install
them on your target machine.

Along with the system level components, a smart card reader and device
driver should be installed on your target machine in order for your
application or service provider DLL to communicate with a smart card
and reader. Please refer to the Smart Card DDK README for information
on how to install the DDK components and device drivers.


---------------
6. C++ Projects
---------------

Visual C++ 5.0 or greater is required to build the  C++ projects. 

The following steps should be taken to build the projects from within 
Developer Studio:

1) Rebuild the low-level COM component .IDL files. (See Building .IDL Files).

2) Set the following include paths in the Tools\Options\Directories menu
property sheet:
	"<Your SDK Install path>\include"
	"<Your SDK Install path>\samples\winbase\scard\app"
	"<Your SDK Install path>\samples\winbase\scard\scardcom"
	"<Your SDK Install path>\samples\winbase\scard\scardcom\cppwrap"

3) Open the example's .mak file in Visual C++.

4) Build the project(s).

Notes: 

1) To change the default build type (Debug, Release, etc.) edit the 
first four lines of the .mak file selecting an alternate build.

2) The projects may be built from the command line after setting the Visual C++
environment variables.

------------------
7. Java Project
------------------

Visual J++ 1.0 or greater is required to build the Java project.

The following steps should be taken to build the project within Developer 
Studio:

1) Create a new Java Project Workspace.

2) Add all the java sample files to the project.

3) Compile the project.

------------------
8. VB Project
------------------

Visual Basic 5.0 or greater is required to build the project.

The following steps should be taken to build the project:

1) Open the .vbp.

2) Make sure the low-level smart card COM (scarddat, scardmgr, scardsrv)
components are referenced in the project.

3) Build the project.

------------------
9. Building .IDL Files
------------------

To rebuild the smart card low-level COM component .IDL files, use the 
following command:

	midl /I<Your Visual C++ install Path>\Include <Filename.Idl>

In this case, it is assumed the \Include directory contains all SDK 
headers not just smart card specific headers.

These files we need to be rebuilt in order to build the samples.

Serial Smart Card Reader
------------------------

This driver is for the Siemens Nixdorf serial smart card reader.

To install this driver, copy the driver sccsni.vxd to your system
directory. Then from Explorer double-click on the reg-file to register
the driver.



PCMCIA Smart Card Reader
------------------------

This is a Plug and Play driver for Windows 95.

To install this driver copy the file pscr.vxd and pscr.inf
onto a floppy and simply insert the pcmcia card into a reader.
Windows 95 will prompt you to insert the floppy disk to install
the driver.

Note: you'll get some warning messages when you 'compile' the rc file.
You may safely ignore these warnings. You'll also get 4 warning 
messages from the linker which you can also safely ignore.


Building Components
-------------------

To build a version of a driver, open a Dos Window and go to your 
DDK directory. Enter 'ddkenv 32 comm'. Select the directory of the 
driver you want to build (e.g. cd scard\samples\pscr). Type 'nmake'.
The driver will be built in the sub-directory bin (non-debug) or 
bind (debug), respectively.

To change from non-debug to debug and vice versa change the option 
DEBUG= to DEBUG=1 in the corresponding makefile.


Installing debug components
---------------------------

In order to get debugging messages you need to install the 
debug-components. By installing the kernel mode library smclib.vxd 
into your system directory you'll be enabled to see debug messages 
and debug assertions in a connected debugger like rterm.

To get debug messages of the smart card resource manager simply copy 
the file scardsvr.exe into your system directory.

Keyboard Smart Card Reader
--------------------------

This driver consists of 2 components. The i8042 port driver for
the keyboard, mouse and the smart card reader. All i/o processing
is done in the driver ps2scrkb.

The driver ps2card is an intermediate driver that is used
to access the port driver. This driver contains no hardware specific 
information.

The directory ps2reg contains a command line based installation
procedure for the keyboard smart card reader. Before you can 
run this file, you must copy ps2scrkb and ps2card into 
your system32\drivers directory.


Serial Smart Card Reader
------------------------

The serial smart card reader makes use of the serial port driver.

To install this driver, copy the driver scrcp8t.sys to your 
system32\drivers directory and from Explorer click on the reg-file 
to register the driver.

IMPORTANT:

     This driver comes with a 'detection' feature. You must insert
     a smart card before you reboot your system. The driver
     tries to detect the reader by resetting the card and trying
     to get an ATR from the card. If you don't insert a card
     after registering the driver the driver won't work


PCMCIA Smart Card Reader
------------------------

To install the pcmcia smart card reader please copy the 
driver pscr.sys into your system32\drivers directory.
In Explorer double-click on the reg-file to register the driver.

You need to make sure that the pcmcia driver is running.
Go to the control panel and click on devices. Select pcmcia
from the list of devices. The status of this device should
be 'Started'. If not click on the 'Startup' button and
select 'Boot'.

There is a known interrupt assignment problem on some systems
that prevents the pcmcia driver from assigning proper 
interrupts to pcmcia cards. If the driver after reboot
does not recognize card insertion and removal events
properly you must change the interrupt assignment of the 
pcmcia driver. The problem occurs usually only on non-laptop 
machines.

To change the interrupt assignment you have to supply
a mask of allowed interrupts for the pcmcia controller.
The example below ONLY allows interrupt 7h to be assigned
to the pcmcia controller. (A '1' prevents the pcmcia driver
from using an interrupt line)

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Pcmcia]
	"InterruptMask"=dword:ffffff7f

NOTE: If you have a second pcmcia card you need to assign
an interrupt for this card, too.


Installing Debug Components
---------------------------

In order to get debugging messages you need to install the 
debug-components. By installing the kernel mode library 
smclib.sys into your system32\drivers directory you'll be
enabled to see debug messages and debug assertions in
a connected debugger like windbg or i386kd.

To get debug messages of the smart card resource manager
simply copy the file scardsvr.exe into your system32 
directory.


Test Programs
-------------
The test program scdrvtst.exe can be used to test basic
driver functionality. To start the test program simply type
'scdrvtst screaderN' where N is is number from 0-9.
The program uses a data file (scdrvtst.dat) from where it reads 
the commands for the cards. The description of the data format 
is contained in the data file itself.

NOTE: You can only run the test program when you've stopped the
Smart Card Resource Manager. To stop the resource manager go to
a command line and type 'net stop scardsvr'. If you don't have the
Smart Card Base Components installed this is not necessary.

Trust Test Plan
---------------


1. Preparation

Configurations needed:
- two or more DCs
- on each DC, make Administrator the current account and be sure to have TcbPrivilege
- on each DC, create a test user account

To automate these steps, use \\scratch\scratch\cristiai\trust\luok.cmd
(luok.cmd requires buildnum.exe, arights.exe and logontst.exe in path)

Depending on the relationships desired between these DCs (parent child,
same enterprise) one or more demote/promote operations (using dcpromo or
an equivalent command line tool) might be needed between test cases.

1.1 Required executables:
trustdom.exe
arights.exe
logontst.exe

From idw:
buildnum.exe (only for luok.cmd)

2. Basic Test Case Scenario

Basically, for each domain and different modes of trust links, the test
users from the other machines will be logged on the current domain.

The steps are:
- set trust links, if necessary (because sometimes trusts are implicitly
  defined, by example if there is a parent-child relationship between
  those domains)
- for a given domain:
	- preparing to logon a user from another domain, grant that user
	  the InteractiveLogonRight (using arights.exe)
	- test logon for that user
- at the end, you can reset the trust links to the status prior to the
  test; take care not to delete trusts not set up by the test, like
  child-parent trusts

3. Notation

Domain names in uppercase only.

X ----> Y
- one way trust from X to Y, i.e. users from Y can log to X but not the
  other way; such a trust link is outbound on X and inbound on Y; it is
  listed by a 'trustdom X -list' command as "Y       ,O,T_uplevel,_,_,_"
  (or T_downlevel, depending if the machines involved are NT5s or NT4s)

X <---> Y
- two way trust; it is listed by a 'trustdom X -list' command as
  "Y        ,B,T_uplevel,_,_,_"

X=P(Y)
- X is parent for domain Y

[A,B,C]
- domains A, B, C are in the same enterprise

A\User
- user account from domain A

B:A\User
- attempt to logon user A\User on domain B

Text after // is used as a comment.

4. Test Cases

Sanity check: on each domain you can perform a local logon with the
local user account (don't forget to grant it locally too the
InteractiveLogonRight)
So, for each domain you can perform a "DOM:DOM\User = PASS"

4.1 Using Two Domains:

4.1.1 No trust link between A and B
A:B\User = FAIL
B:A\User = FAIL

4.1.2 A ---> B
A:B\User = PASS
B:A\User = FAIL

4.1.3 A <--> B
A:B\User = PASS
B:A\User = PASS

4.2 Using Three Domains:

4.2.1 Separate enterprises (i.e. [A] [B] [C])
Logon must succeed depending only on the existance of the trust between
the two domain involved, no transitivity

That is for A <--> B --> C,
A:B\User = PASS	// because of A <--> B
A:C\User = FAIL // no transitivity

B:A\User = PASS // because of A <--> B
B:C\User = PASS // because of B ---> C

C:A\User = FAIL
C:B\User = FAIL

4.2.2 [A,B,C] and B=P(A)
All combinations must pass, that is:
A:B\User = PASS
A:C\User = PASS // due to transitivity inside the enterprise

B:A\User = PASS
B:C\User = PASS

C:A\User = PASS // due to transitivity inside the enterprise
C:B\User = PASS

There is no automatic upgrade available from an earlier version of
LAN Manager. You must save configuration information for reference
purposes (for example, C:\LANMAN.DOS\*.INI, C:\CONFIG.SYS, and
C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT), remove the earlier version, and then install
version 2.2c.

Do not simply reinstall the configuration files from the earlier
version; use them as a reference for modifying the new files if
necessary.


2. IPCONFIG.EXE and Controlling DHCP Leases
-------------------------------------------
The IPCONFIG.EXE utility provides DHCP configuration information.
The version of IPCONFIG.EXE provided with the LAN Manager client
does not support command-line switches for controlling DHCP
address leases; you must use the DHCP Administration Utility
instead.

Specifically, the LAN Manager IPCONFIG.EXE utility does not support
the following switches, which are available in the IPCONFIG.EXE utilities
for Windows for Workgroups and for Windows NT:

	IPCONFIG /release
	IPCONFIG /renew
	IPCONFIG /?
	IPCONFIG /all


3. Specifying WINS Servers
--------------------------
If your MS-DOS client uses DHCP (the default setting for MS-DOS TCP/IP),
it will automatically receive the address for the WINS server. If you
want to statically configure your WINS server IP address, you must edit
the client's PROTOCOL.INI file and add the IP address into the [TCPIP]
section.

For example, if you have 2 WINS servers available, add them into the
[TCPIP] section as shown in the example below. Note that there are no
dots (.) in the IP addresses.

	[TCPIP]
	   WINS_SERVER0 = 11 101 13 53
	   WINS_SERVER1 = 11 101 12 198

Name queries will be sent to the WINS servers in the order in which they
appear in the .INI file. The IPCONFIG command may show a different order
of WINS servers (or even different WINS servers altogether) -- these
are the WINS server names sent by DHCP, and the PROTOCOL.INI settings
override them.


4. Differences in MS-DOS TCP/IP
-------------------------------
There is a difference in functionality available in TCP/IP for
Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT Workstation and Server, versus
MS-DOS TCP/IP.  Specifically, an MS-DOS TCP/IP client does not:

	support DNS resolution using WINS
	support WINS resolution using DNS
	register its name with the WINS database; it does queries only
	act as a WINS proxy node
	have multihomed support
	support IGMP


5. Logging On With TCP/IP Across a Router
-----------------------------------------
If the domain controller is across a router from the LAN Manager client,
you must add a line to the client's LMHOSTS file for logons to be
validated. The line is of the following form:

	www.xxx.yyy.zzz    SRV_NAME  #DOM:DOM_NAME

where
	www.xxx.yyy.zzz is the IP address of the domain controller
	SRV_NAME is the NetBIOS name of the domain controller
	DOM_NAME is the name of the domain

You must also ensure that the domain controller can contact the client,
using one of the following methods:

	Enter the client's IP address and name in the domain controller's
	LMHOSTS file.

	Register the client with a WINS server that is accessible by
	the domain controller. (LAN Manager clients do not automatically
	register with WINS servers; they only query the WINS servers.)

	Use the LAN Manager 2.1a (and higher) "TCP/IP Extensions for
	LAN Manager," a hub/node service that runs on LAN Manager
	servers to integrate domains across routers.


6. Installing With Microsoft Windows 3.1
----------------------------------------
If possible, install Microsoft Windows before installing LAN Manager,
so that the LAN Manager Setup program detects the presence of Windows
and makes changes automatically to the Windows SYSTEM.INI file.

If you do install Windows after LAN Manager, add the following lines
manually to the end of the [386enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file:

   TimerCriticalSection=5000
   UniqueDosPSP=True
   PSPIncrement=2


7. EMM386 Memory Conflict with Token Ring Network Adapters
----------------------------------------------------------
The error message "Error 36: Unspecified Hardware failure" may occur
when you start the computer with a token ring adapter if there is a
memory conflict with EMM386. If this occurs, exclude the memory address
of the network adapter on the EMM386 line in CONFIG.SYS.

For more information about memory conflicts and excluding memory ranges,
see the "Microsoft Network Client 2.2 Installation Guide for Clients,"
Appendix F, or the "LAN Manager 2.2 Installation Guide."


8. Overview of Windows Sockets
------------------------------
Microsoft TCP/IP includes support for Windows Sockets on Microsoft Windows 
and Workgroups for Windows workstations. A socket provides an end point to 
a connection; two sockets form a complete path. A socket works as a 
bi-directional pipe for incoming and outgoing data. The Windows Sockets API 
is a networking API tailored for use by programmers using the Microsoft 
Windows operating system. Windows Sockets is a public specification based 
on Berkeley UNIX sockets and aims to:

*  Provide a familiar networking API to programmers using Windows or UNIX.
*  Offer binary compatibility between heterogeneous Windows-based TCP/IP 
   stack and utilities vendors.
*  Support both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

If you are running an application that uses Windows Sockets, be sure to 
enable Windows Sockets when you configure Microsoft TCP/IP. If you are 
unsure whether any of your applications use Windows Sockets, refer to the 
documentation included with that vendor's application.


9. Setting DNR and Sockets Settings
-----------------------------------
If you specify the MS TCP/IP protocol during setup, you will now see an 
additional dialog box after you have used the Advanced button in the 
MS-TCP/IP Configuration dialog box. This new dialog box, DNR and Sockets 
Settings, is used only if your MS TCP/IP network has a domain name service 
(DNS) server. If your network has a DNS and you choose to configure the 
Domain Name Resolver (DNR) parameters, the DNR module will be loaded with 
your sockets and Telnet applications to resolve hostname-to-IP address 
mappings. This allows you to specify remote computers by computername 
without knowing specific IP addresses. If you use this dialog box, these 
are the values you will need to supply:

Username
Your username.

Hostname
  The computername your workstation will report when using the remote 
  services. The default is your LAN Manager computername.

Primary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult first when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Secondary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings if the request to the 
  primary nameserver fails.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Domain Name Suffix
  The suffix appended to any computername for DNS processing. Your network 
  administrator can tell you what to enter here.

Enable Windows Sockets
  Mark this checkbox if you want Sockets to be invoked from the 
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Number of Sockets
  The maximum number of sockets that can be made available to applications 
  at any one time. The range is 1 to 22 sockets.

  Note: Some applications may use more than one socket to provide a service. 
        Consider this when trying to maximize available memory. The total 
        number of sockets and NetBIOS sessions combined must not exceed 22.


10. If Microsoft RPC Is Installed
---------------------------------
If Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is installed on your system, 
you must copy RPC16C3.DLL from the \DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP directory of 
the DOS DRIVERS 2 disk to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory in order for 
Windows Sockets to work properly with Microsoft TCP/IP.

------------------------------------------


1. Installing Network Client
----------------------------
If you are installing Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS
on a computer that does not have MS-DOS installed, you will get the
error "No Drivers Present On This Disk" if you try to use the Windows
Driver Library. You must have MS-DOS installed on the computer.

If you have a Windows NT Server floppy disk set and you want to make
extra copies of Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, note that the
installation disk for this client will only fit on a 3.5" floppy disk.


2. Setup PATH Problem With Microsoft Windows
--------------------------------------------
If you have Microsoft Windows installed on your computer before you
install Network Client, the Network Client Setup program may incorrectly
alter the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The PATH line should include the Windows directory. Check this line after
you install Network Client. If the Windows directory was removed from the
PATH, add it back in.


3. If You Have an 8088 Processor
--------------------------------
You must use the basic redirector if your computer has an 8088
processor. The full redirector is the default, so you must choose
the basic redirector when you install.


4. Setup Requires 429K Available Memory
---------------------------------------
In order to run Network Client Setup, you must have 429K of
available conventional memory.


5. Setup is Slow on Some Computers
----------------------------------
On some computers, particularly those with 8088 processors, Network
Client Setup may appear to pause for as long as five minutes. 
Do not restart your computer. 


6. Network Client Cannot Be Set Up on DoubleDisk Drive
------------------------------------------------------
You cannot use Network Client on a Vertisoft Systems DoubleDisk
drive. You must set up Network Client on another type of drive.


7.  Windows 3.x Setup Network Choice
------------------------------------
If you have installed Microsoft Network Client 3.0 and then later
install Windows 3.x, the Windows Setup program asks you to choose
your network type from a list. "Network Client" does not appear on
the list because it is newer than Windows 3.x. Instead, choose
"LAN Manager 2.1."


8. If COMMAND.COM is Not in Root Directory
------------------------------------------
Network Client will not start if your COMMAND.COM file is not in the
root directory of your startup drive, unless you have a SHELL command
in your CONFIG.SYS file that specifies the location of COMMAND.COM.
For information about the COMMAND and SHELL commands, see your
MS-DOS documentation.


9. Using INTERLNK and INTERSVR
------------------------------
Do not use the MS-DOS INTERLNK or INTERSVR commands with Network Client.


10. Using TSRs with Network Client
----------------------------------
If you start any terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) and you are
using the basic redirector, you might be unable to unload the basic
redirector.


11. Named Pipes and Enhanced Mode Windows
-----------------------------------------
Asynchronous named pipes are not supported on Microsoft Network Client
when the client is running under enhanced mode Windows. All other client
APIs are supported, including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, and IPX/SPX.


12. Using Qualitas Maximize or Quarterdeck Optimize
---------------------------------------------------
In some rare situations, Qualitas(R) Maximize and Quarterdeck(R)
Optimize may attempt to load some Network Client commands into the
upper memory area. If this causes problems, use Maximize or Optimize in
manual mode and do not use it to load Network Client commands into the 
upper memory area. Network Client automatically loads its commands
into the upper memory area, if there is enough space. For information
about using manual mode, see your Maximize or Optimize documentation.


13. Using QEMM Lastdrive
------------------------
If you add drive letters by using QEMM(R) Lastdrive, and then use
Network Client to connect to one of them, the connection will be 
successful but no information about the shared resources on it will be 
displayed.


14. Making the Pop-up Interface Visible on a Monochrome Monitor
---------------------------------------------------------------
To make the Network Client pop-up interface appear in monochrome
mode, type MODE MONO at the MS-DOS command prompt before you display
the pop-up interface, or include the MODE MONO command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.


15. Enabling Validated Logons to Windows NT Server and LAN Manager 
    Domains
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must run the Network Client full redirector to have your 
user name and password validated by a Microsoft Windows NT Server 
or LAN Manager server.


16. Network Settings in SYSTEM.INI
----------------------------------
The [Network] section of your SYSTEM.INI file contains the following
settings:

  filesharing=  Does not apply to Network Client.

  printsharing=  Does not apply to Network Client.

  autologon=  Determines whether Network Client will automatically
              prompt you for logon when it starts.

  computername=  The name of your computer.

  lanroot=    The directory in which you installed Network Client.

  username=   The username used by default at logon.

  workgroup=  The workgroup name.  Note that this may be different
              from the "logondomain" setting.

  reconnect=  Determines whether Network Client restores previous
              connections when it starts.

  dospophotkey=  Determines the key you press (with CTRL+ALT) to start
              the pop-up interface. The default is N, meaning that you
              press CTRL+ALT+N.

  lmlogon=    Determines whether Network Client prompts you for a
              domain logon when you log on. Set this to 1 if you need
              to log on to a Windows NT Server or LAN Manager domain.

  logondomain=  The name of the Windows NT Server or LAN Manager 
              domain.

  preferredredir=  The redirector that starts by default when you
              type the NET START command.

  autostart=  If you choose a network adapter during setup, and specify
              the startup option Run Network Client Logon, autostart 
              determines which redirector you are using. If you select 
              No Network Adapter from the adapter list, or Do Not Run 
              Network Client from the startup options, autostart has 
              no value, but the NET START command still appears in 
              your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

  maxconnections=  Does not apply to Network Client.


17. NWLink Supports IPX Only
----------------------------
The NWLink protocol shipped with Microsoft Network Client supports
only IPX. SPX is not supported.


18. Installing the MS-DLC Protocol
----------------------------------
If you install the MS-DLC protocol, you must edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
to add "/dynamic" to the NET INITIALIZE line. The line should be:

	net initialize /dynamic

If one does not already exist, add a NETBIND line after all lines in
AUTOEXEC.BAT that load network drivers. The line should simply be:

	netbind


19. Installing Remote Access Service 1.1a
-----------------------------------------
To use RAS, you must use the Network Client full redirector.

After creating the RAS 1.1a disks, run the Network Client Setup
program. Do not use the setup program provided with RAS 1.1a to
configure your network settings.

1. In the Network Client directory, run SETUP.EXE.

2. Choose Change Network Settings, and then select Add Adapter. 

3. Select Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver from the list of
   adapters, and then choose The Listed Options Are Correct.

4. After running Setup, run the RASCOPY.BAT batch file. It will prompt
   you for the Remote Access Service disk 1 and disk 2. 

To disable remote access, remove Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver 
from the list of adapters. To re-enable it, follow steps 1 through 3.

When the Remote Access files are installed, a RAS directory is created
in your Network Client directory. Use the SETUP.EXE program in this 
directory only to configure your modem, not to configure network
settings. In particular, do not select Enable Remote Access or Remove
Remote Access when running SETUP.EXE from the RAS directory.


20. Browsing the Network Requires a Windows for Workgroups or
    Windows NT Computer on the Network
-------------------------------------------------------------
Network Client does not provide a browse master.  In order for you to
browse the network, a browse master must be present.  Therefore,
a computer running Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT must be on the
network and belong to the same workgroup as the computer running
Network Client. See the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit for
information on making the Windows for Workgroups machine a browse
master.

Note that this does not prevent you from connecting to a shared
resource. You will just need to know the name of the server and share
beforehand in order to connect to it.


21. IPCONFIG.EXE and Controlling DHCP Leases
--------------------------------------------
The IPCONFIG.EXE utility provides DHCP configuration information.
The version of IPCONFIG.EXE provided with the Microsoft Network Client
does not support command-line switches for controlling DHCP
address leases; you must use the DHCP Administration Utility
instead.

Specifically, the Network Client IPCONFIG.EXE utility does not support
the following switches, which are available in the IPCONFIG.EXE utilities
for Windows for Workgroups and for Windows NT:

	IPCONFIG /release
	IPCONFIG /renew
	IPCONFIG /?
	IPCONFIG /all


22. Specifying WINS Servers
---------------------------
If your MS-DOS client uses DHCP (the default setting for MS-DOS TCP/IP),
it will automatically receive the address for the WINS server. If you
want to statically configure your WINS server IP address, you must edit
the client's PROTOCOL.INI file and add the IP address into the [TCPIP]
section.

For example, if you have 2 WINS servers available, add them into the
[TCPIP] section as shown in the example below. Note that there are no
dots (.) in the IP addresses.

	[TCPIP]
	   WINS_SERVER0 = 11 101 13 53
	   WINS_SERVER1 = 11 101 12 198

Name queries will be sent to the WINS servers in the order in which they
appear in the .INI file. The IPCONFIG command may show a different order
of WINS servers (or even different WINS servers altogether) -- these
are the WINS server names sent by DHCP, and the PROTOCOL.INI settings
override them.


23. Differences in MS-DOS TCP/IP
--------------------------------
There is a difference in functionality available in TCP/IP for
Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT Workstation and Server, versus
MS-DOS TCP/IP.  Specifically, an MS-DOS TCP/IP client does not:

	support DNS resolution using WINS
	support WINS resolution using DNS
	register its name with the WINS database; it does queries only
	act as a WINS proxy node
	have multihomed support
	support IGMP


24. Logging On With TCP/IP Across a Router
------------------------------------------
If the domain controller is across a router from the Network Client
computer, you must add a line to the client's LMHOSTS file for logons
to be validated. The line is of the following form:

	www.xxx.yyy.zzz    SRV_NAME  #DOM:DOM_NAME

where
	www.xxx.yyy.zzz is the IP address of the domain controller
	SRV_NAME is the NetBIOS name of the domain controller
	DOM_NAME is the name of the domain

You must also ensure that the domain controller can contact the client,
using one of the following methods:

	Enter the client's IP address and name in the domain controller's
	LMHOSTS file.

	Register the client with a WINS server that is accessible by
	the domain controller. (Network Client computers do not
	automatically register with WINS servers; they only query the
	WINS servers.)

	Use the LAN Manager 2.1a (and higher) "TCP/IP Extensions for
	LAN Manager," a hub/node service that runs on LAN Manager
	servers to integrate domains across routers.


25. Overview of Windows Sockets
-------------------------------
Microsoft TCP/IP includes support for Windows Sockets on Microsoft Windows 
and Workgroups for Windows workstations. A socket provides an end point to 
a connection; two sockets form a complete path. A socket works as a 
bi-directional pipe for incoming and outgoing data. The Windows Sockets API 
is a networking API tailored for use by programmers using the Microsoft 
Windows operating system. Windows Sockets is a public specification based 
on Berkeley UNIX sockets and aims to:

*  Provide a familiar networking API to programmers using Windows or UNIX.
*  Offer binary compatibility between heterogeneous Windows-based TCP/IP 
   stack and utilities vendors.
*  Support both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

If you are running an application that uses Windows Sockets, be sure to 
enable Windows Sockets when you configure Microsoft TCP/IP. If you are 
unsure whether any of your applications use Windows Sockets, refer to the 
documentation included with that vendor's application.


26. Setting DNR and Sockets Settings
------------------------------------
If you specify the MS TCP/IP protocol during setup, you will now see an 
additional dialog box after you have used the Advanced button in the 
MS-TCP/IP Configuration dialog box. This new dialog box, DNR and Sockets 
Settings, is used only if your MS TCP/IP network has a domain name service 
(DNS) server. If your network has a DNS and you choose to configure the 
Domain Name Resolver (DNR) parameters, the DNR module will be loaded with 
your sockets and Telnet applications to resolve hostname-to-IP address 
mappings. This allows you to specify remote computers by computername 
without knowing specific IP addresses. If you use this dialog box, these 
are the values you will need to supply:

Username
Your username.

Hostname
  The computername your workstation will report when using the remote 
  services. The default is your LAN Manager computername.

Primary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult first when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Secondary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings if the request to the 
  primary nameserver fails.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Domain Name Suffix
  The suffix appended to any computername for DNS processing. Your network 
  administrator can tell you what to enter here.

Enable Windows Sockets
  Mark this checkbox if you want Sockets to be invoked from the 
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Number of Sockets
  The maximum number of sockets that can be made available to applications 
  at any one time. The range is 1 to 22 sockets.

  Note: Some applications may use more than one socket to provide a service. 
        Consider this when trying to maximize available memory. The total 
        number of sockets and NetBIOS sessions combined must not exceed 22.

1. Installing Network Client
----------------------------
If you are installing Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS
on a computer that does not have MS-DOS installed, you will get the
error "No Drivers Present On This Disk" if you try to use the Windows
Driver Library. You must have MS-DOS installed on the computer.

If you have a Windows NT Server floppy disk set and you want to make
extra copies of Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, note that the
installation disk for this client will only fit on a 3.5" floppy disk.


2. Setup PATH Problem With Microsoft Windows
--------------------------------------------
If you have Microsoft Windows installed on your computer before you
install Network Client, the Network Client Setup program may incorrectly
alter the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The PATH line should include the Windows directory. Check this line after
you install Network Client. If the Windows directory was removed from the
PATH, add it back in.


3. If You Have an 8088 Processor
--------------------------------
You must use the basic redirector if your computer has an 8088
processor. The full redirector is the default, so you must choose
the basic redirector when you install.


4. Setup Requires 429K Available Memory
---------------------------------------
In order to run Network Client Setup, you must have 429K of
available conventional memory.


5. Setup is Slow on Some Computers
----------------------------------
On some computers, particularly those with 8088 processors, Network
Client Setup may appear to pause for as long as five minutes. 
Do not restart your computer. 


6. Network Client Cannot Be Set Up on DoubleDisk Drive
------------------------------------------------------
You cannot use Network Client on a Vertisoft Systems DoubleDisk
drive. You must set up Network Client on another type of drive.


7.  Windows 3.x Setup Network Choice
------------------------------------
If you have installed Microsoft Network Client 3.0 and then later
install Windows 3.x, the Windows Setup program asks you to choose
your network type from a list. "Network Client" does not appear on
the list because it is newer than Windows 3.x. Instead, choose
"LAN Manager 2.1."


8. If COMMAND.COM is Not in Root Directory
------------------------------------------
Network Client will not start if your COMMAND.COM file is not in the
root directory of your startup drive, unless you have a SHELL command
in your CONFIG.SYS file that specifies the location of COMMAND.COM.
For information about the COMMAND and SHELL commands, see your
MS-DOS documentation.


9. Using INTERLNK and INTERSVR
------------------------------
Do not use the MS-DOS INTERLNK or INTERSVR commands with Network Client.


10. Using TSRs with Network Client
----------------------------------
If you start any terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) and you are
using the basic redirector, you might be unable to unload the basic
redirector.


11. Named Pipes and Enhanced Mode Windows
-----------------------------------------
Asynchronous named pipes are not supported on Microsoft Network Client
when the client is running under enhanced mode Windows. All other client
APIs are supported, including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, and IPX/SPX.


12. Using Qualitas Maximize or Quarterdeck Optimize
---------------------------------------------------
In some rare situations, Qualitas(R) Maximize and Quarterdeck(R)
Optimize may attempt to load some Network Client commands into the
upper memory area. If this causes problems, use Maximize or Optimize in
manual mode and do not use it to load Network Client commands into the 
upper memory area. Network Client automatically loads its commands
into the upper memory area, if there is enough space. For information
about using manual mode, see your Maximize or Optimize documentation.


13. Using QEMM Lastdrive
------------------------
If you add drive letters by using QEMM(R) Lastdrive, and then use
Network Client to connect to one of them, the connection will be 
successful but no information about the shared resources on it will be 
displayed.


14. Making the Pop-up Interface Visible on a Monochrome Monitor
---------------------------------------------------------------
To make the Network Client pop-up interface appear in monochrome
mode, type MODE MONO at the MS-DOS command prompt before you display
the pop-up interface, or include the MODE MONO command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.


15. Enabling Validated Logons to Windows NT Server and LAN Manager 
    Domains
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must run the Network Client full redirector to have your 
user name and password validated by a Microsoft Windows NT Server 
or LAN Manager server.


16. Network Settings in SYSTEM.INI
----------------------------------
The [Network] section of your SYSTEM.INI file contains the following
settings:

  filesharing=  Does not apply to Network Client.

  printsharing=  Does not apply to Network Client.

  autologon=  Determines whether Network Client will automatically
              prompt you for logon when it starts.

  computername=  The name of your computer.

  lanroot=    The directory in which you installed Network Client.

  username=   The username used by default at logon.

  workgroup=  The workgroup name.  Note that this may be different
              from the "logondomain" setting.

  reconnect=  Determines whether Network Client restores previous
              connections when it starts.

  dospophotkey=  Determines the key you press (with CTRL+ALT) to start
              the pop-up interface. The default is N, meaning that you
              press CTRL+ALT+N.

  lmlogon=    Determines whether Network Client prompts you for a
              domain logon when you log on. Set this to 1 if you need
              to log on to a Windows NT Server or LAN Manager domain.

  logondomain=  The name of the Windows NT Server or LAN Manager 
              domain.

  preferredredir=  The redirector that starts by default when you
              type the NET START command.

  autostart=  If you choose a network adapter during setup, and specify
              the startup option Run Network Client Logon, autostart 
              determines which redirector you are using. If you select 
              No Network Adapter from the adapter list, or Do Not Run 
              Network Client from the startup options, autostart has 
              no value, but the NET START command still appears in 
              your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

  maxconnections=  Does not apply to Network Client.


17. NWLink Supports IPX Only
----------------------------
The NWLink protocol shipped with Microsoft Network Client supports
only IPX. SPX is not supported.


18. Installing the MS-DLC Protocol
----------------------------------
If you install the MS-DLC protocol, you must edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
to add "/dynamic" to the NET INITIALIZE line. The line should be:

	net initialize /dynamic

If one does not already exist, add a NETBIND line after all lines in
AUTOEXEC.BAT that load network drivers. The line should simply be:

	netbind


19. Installing Remote Access Service 1.1a
-----------------------------------------
To use RAS, you must use the Network Client full redirector.

After creating the RAS 1.1a disks, run the Network Client Setup
program. Do not use the setup program provided with RAS 1.1a to
configure your network settings.

1. In the Network Client directory, run SETUP.EXE.

2. Choose Change Network Settings, and then select Add Adapter. 

3. Select Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver from the list of
   adapters, and then choose The Listed Options Are Correct.

4. After running Setup, run the RASCOPY.BAT batch file. It will prompt
   you for the Remote Access Service disk 1 and disk 2. 

To disable remote access, remove Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver 
from the list of adapters. To re-enable it, follow steps 1 through 3.

When the Remote Access files are installed, a RAS directory is created
in your Network Client directory. Use the SETUP.EXE program in this 
directory only to configure your modem, not to configure network
settings. In particular, do not select Enable Remote Access or Remove
Remote Access when running SETUP.EXE from the RAS directory.


20. Browsing the Network Requires a Windows for Workgroups or
    Windows NT Computer on the Network
-------------------------------------------------------------
Network Client does not provide a browse master.  In order for you to
browse the network, a browse master must be present.  Therefore,
a computer running Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT must be on the
network and belong to the same workgroup as the computer running
Network Client. See the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit for
information on making the Windows for Workgroups machine a browse
master.

Note that this does not prevent you from connecting to a shared
resource. You will just need to know the name of the server and share
beforehand in order to connect to it.


21. IPCONFIG.EXE and Controlling DHCP Leases
--------------------------------------------
The IPCONFIG.EXE utility provides DHCP configuration information.
The version of IPCONFIG.EXE provided with the Microsoft Network Client
does not support command-line switches for controlling DHCP
address leases; you must use the DHCP Administration Utility
instead.

Specifically, the Network Client IPCONFIG.EXE utility does not support
the following switches, which are available in the IPCONFIG.EXE utilities
for Windows for Workgroups and for Windows NT:

	IPCONFIG /release
	IPCONFIG /renew
	IPCONFIG /?
	IPCONFIG /all


22. Specifying WINS Servers
---------------------------
If your MS-DOS client uses DHCP (the default setting for MS-DOS TCP/IP),
it will automatically receive the address for the WINS server. If you
want to statically configure your WINS server IP address, you must edit
the client's PROTOCOL.INI file and add the IP address into the [TCPIP]
section.

For example, if you have 2 WINS servers available, add them into the
[TCPIP] section as shown in the example below. Note that there are no
dots (.) in the IP addresses.

	[TCPIP]
	   WINS_SERVER0 = 11 101 13 53
	   WINS_SERVER1 = 11 101 12 198

Name queries will be sent to the WINS servers in the order in which they
appear in the .INI file. The IPCONFIG command may show a different order
of WINS servers (or even different WINS servers altogether) -- these
are the WINS server names sent by DHCP, and the PROTOCOL.INI settings
override them.


23. Differences in MS-DOS TCP/IP
--------------------------------
There is a difference in functionality available in TCP/IP for
Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT Workstation and Server, versus
MS-DOS TCP/IP.  Specifically, an MS-DOS TCP/IP client does not:

	support DNS resolution using WINS
	support WINS resolution using DNS
	register its name with the WINS database; it does queries only
	act as a WINS proxy node
	have multihomed support
	support IGMP


24. Logging On With TCP/IP Across a Router
------------------------------------------
If the domain controller is across a router from the Network Client
computer, you must add a line to the client's LMHOSTS file for logons
to be validated. The line is of the following form:

	www.xxx.yyy.zzz    SRV_NAME  #DOM:DOM_NAME

where
	www.xxx.yyy.zzz is the IP address of the domain controller
	SRV_NAME is the NetBIOS name of the domain controller
	DOM_NAME is the name of the domain

You must also ensure that the domain controller can contact the client,
using one of the following methods:

	Enter the client's IP address and name in the domain controller's
	LMHOSTS file.

	Register the client with a WINS server that is accessible by
	the domain controller. (Network Client computers do not
	automatically register with WINS servers; they only query the
	WINS servers.)

	Use the LAN Manager 2.1a (and higher) "TCP/IP Extensions for
	LAN Manager," a hub/node service that runs on LAN Manager
	servers to integrate domains across routers.


25. Overview of Windows Sockets
-------------------------------
Microsoft TCP/IP includes support for Windows Sockets on Microsoft Windows 
and Workgroups for Windows workstations. A socket provides an end point to 
a connection; two sockets form a complete path. A socket works as a 
bi-directional pipe for incoming and outgoing data. The Windows Sockets API 
is a networking API tailored for use by programmers using the Microsoft 
Windows operating system. Windows Sockets is a public specification based 
on Berkeley UNIX sockets and aims to:

*  Provide a familiar networking API to programmers using Windows or UNIX.
*  Offer binary compatibility between heterogeneous Windows-based TCP/IP 
   stack and utilities vendors.
*  Support both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

If you are running an application that uses Windows Sockets, be sure to 
enable Windows Sockets when you configure Microsoft TCP/IP. If you are 
unsure whether any of your applications use Windows Sockets, refer to the 
documentation included with that vendor's application.


26. Setting DNR and Sockets Settings
------------------------------------
If you specify the MS TCP/IP protocol during setup, you will now see an 
additional dialog box after you have used the Advanced button in the 
MS-TCP/IP Configuration dialog box. This new dialog box, DNR and Sockets 
Settings, is used only if your MS TCP/IP network has a domain name service 
(DNS) server. If your network has a DNS and you choose to configure the 
Domain Name Resolver (DNR) parameters, the DNR module will be loaded with 
your sockets and Telnet applications to resolve hostname-to-IP address 
mappings. This allows you to specify remote computers by computername 
without knowing specific IP addresses. If you use this dialog box, these 
are the values you will need to supply:

Username
Your username.

Hostname
  The computername your workstation will report when using the remote 
  services. The default is your LAN Manager computername.

Primary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult first when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Secondary Nameserver IP Address
  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult when 
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings if the request to the 
  primary nameserver fails.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server
  address automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do
  specify an address here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Domain Name Suffix
  The suffix appended to any computername for DNS processing. Your network 
  administrator can tell you what to enter here.

Enable Windows Sockets
  Mark this checkbox if you want Sockets to be invoked from the 
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Number of Sockets
  The maximum number of sockets that can be made available to applications 
  at any one time. The range is 1 to 22 sockets.

  Note: Some applications may use more than one socket to provide a service. 
        Consider this when trying to maximize available memory. The total 
        number of sockets and NetBIOS sessions combined must not exceed 22.

Troubleshooting

Network Access Problems

If you are denied access to your network, contact your system administrator. 
You may not have a valid user account on your LAN Manager network, or you 
may not have permission to dial in. 

Connection and Response Problems

If the Remote Access server is not responding, one or more of the following 
may be true:

-  The Remote Access server is not running. Contact your system administrator.
-  You are using an incompatible version of the Remote Access software. 
   Contact your system administrator.
-  The modem on the Remote Access server has been turned off. Contact your 
   system administrator.
-  Your modem and/or modem configurations are incompatible with the modem on 
   the Remote Access server. Contact your system administrator. 
-  Your hotel room telephone line cannot accommodate your current modem speed. 
   Use a lower baud rate or contact the hotel manager to request a direct 
   line.
-  You specified the wrong telephone number. Update your Phone Book entry and 
   redial. 
-  You did not specify a special number that gives you an outside line. For 
   example, some businesses and hotels require you to dial 9 before dialing 
   your number.
-  There is static on the telephone line. Contact your phone service provider.

Modem Problems

If your modem is not responding properly, one of the following may be true:

- Your modem has been turned off or unplugged.
- Your modem is not properly connected to your computer. 
- Your modem is in an inconsistent state. Restart or reset your modem and 
  redial.
- Your modem and/or modem cables are defective or not compatible for use with 
  Remote Access. Contact your system administrator.
- Your modem is not configured correctly. See your modem user guide or 
  contact your system administrator. 

If your modem connects at a lower baud rate than you specified, the Remote 
Access server may have a modem type different from what you are using. 
Contact your system administrator.

Unloading Problems (DOS Remote Access Drivers Only) 

If you encounter problems when unloading the Remote Access drivers, one of 
the following may be true:

-  A telephone connection still exists. The Remote Access drivers will not 
   unload if a telephone connection exists. This protects you from accidently 
   hanging up a connection and losing data. Save your data files, disconnect 
   the phone line, and then try the rasload /u command again.
-  You have an incorrect TSR unloading order. The Remote Access drivers will 
   not unload if you load a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program or 
   start the Workstation service after typing rasload. Ensure that your 
   loading order is correct.

Net805 Error 

One likely cause of this error is the following incorrect settings in MODEMS.INF:

-  Port-to-modem speed (DTE speed) is higher than modem-to-modem speed (DCE 
   speed), and
-  Flow control is OFF.

To correct the configuration, make one of the following adjustments:

-  If you want flow control to be OFF, set the DTE speed and the DCE speed 
   to the same value, or
-  If you want to enable compression, set the flow control value to ON.

at step 2. If you are running OS/2 start at step 3.

1.  Type unload protocol.
2.  Type rasload to load the Remote Access drivers.
3.  Type rasphone to open the Phone Book. 
4.  Create and save a Phone Book entry (use Help).
5.  Connect to the network (use Help).

Note: If you plan to run the Microsoft Windows (TM) graphical environment, 
you must load the Remote Access drivers before starting the Windows 
environment.


Using the Network

You can now use the network exactly as if you were in your office.

Important: You can access data files across the telephone connection, 
but loading software programs across the network (that is, across 
the telephone line) will cause extremely long delays. Contact your 
system administrator for more details.


Disconnecting from the Network

1.  Type rasphone to open the Phone Book.
2.  From the Dial menu, choose Disconnect.


Unloading Remote Access Drivers

If you are running DOS and LAN Manager Enhanced on a dual-role computer, 
you should unload the Remote Access drivers prior to switching from your 
modem to your network adapter card, or vice versa. If you are running 
any other DOS configuration, unloading the Remote Access drivers will free 
up memory that may be needed to run other applications. To unload the 
Remote Access drivers:

Type rasload /u.

Troubleshooting

Network Access Problems

If you are denied access to your network, contact your system administrator. 
You may not have a valid user account on your LAN Manager network, or you 
may not have permission to dial in. 

Connection and Response Problems

If the Remote Access server is not responding, one or more of the following 
may be true:

-  The Remote Access server is not running. Contact your system administrator.
-  You are using an incompatible version of the Remote Access software. 
   Contact your system administrator.
-  The modem on the Remote Access server has been turned off. Contact your 
   system administrator.
-  Your modem and/or modem configurations are incompatible with the modem on 
   the Remote Access server. Contact your system administrator. 
-  Your hotel room telephone line cannot accommodate your current modem speed. 
   Use a lower baud rate or contact the hotel manager to request a direct 
   line.
-  You specified the wrong telephone number. Update your Phone Book entry and 
   redial. 
-  You did not specify a special number that gives you an outside line. For 
   example, some businesses and hotels require you to dial 9 before dialing 
   your number.
-  There is static on the telephone line. Contact your phone service provider.

Modem Problems

If your modem is not responding properly, one of the following may be true:

- Your modem has been turned off or unplugged.
- Your modem is not properly connected to your computer. 
- Your modem is in an inconsistent state. Restart or reset your modem and 
  redial.
- Your modem and/or modem cables are defective or not compatible for use with 
  Remote Access. Contact your system administrator.
- Your modem is not configured correctly. See your modem user guide or 
  contact your system administrator. 

If your modem connects at a lower baud rate than you specified, the Remote 
Access server may have a modem type different from what you are using. 
Contact your system administrator.

Unloading Problems (DOS Remote Access Drivers Only) 

If you encounter problems when unloading the Remote Access drivers, one of 
the following may be true:

-  A telephone connection still exists. The Remote Access drivers will not 
   unload if a telephone connection exists. This protects you from accidently 
   hanging up a connection and losing data. Save your data files, disconnect 
   the phone line, and then try the rasload /u command again.
-  You have an incorrect TSR unloading order. The Remote Access drivers will 
   not unload if you load a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program or 
   start the Workstation service after typing rasload. Ensure that your 
   loading order is correct.

Net805 Error 

One likely cause of this error is the following incorrect settings in MODEMS.INF:

-  Port-to-modem speed (DTE speed) is higher than modem-to-modem speed (DCE 
   speed), and
-  Flow control is OFF.

To correct the configuration, make one of the following adjustments:

-  If you want flow control to be OFF, set the DTE speed and the DCE speed 
   to the same value, or
-  If you want to enable compression, set the flow control value to ON.

Preparing a Network Installation Disk
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
This document describes manual procedures for preparing a floppy disk known as a network installation disk. This disk is a system disk that includes just enough software to start a computer, connect the computer to the network, and start the procedure for installing Windows NT from a shared network drive. 
A network installation disk is required to install beta versions of Windows NT 5.0 on computers that do not have a CD-ROM drive and cannot connect to a shared Windows NT directory on the network.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most efficient way to install Windows NT(r) on multiple computers that do not have CD-ROM drives is to place a copy of the Windows NT setup files on a shared directory on a server and install the operating system from this directory on computers connected to the network.
In order to use this method, all computers must be able to connect to the network, to gain access to the shared directory, and start the installation program. On new computers and on computers with no operating system installed, you must provide the files required for these tasks on a floppy disk. This floppy disk, known as a network installation disk, provides just enough software to begin installing Windows NT from the network.
Windows NT 4.0 and earlier versions include the Network Client Administrator program (Ncadmin.exe), which prepares a network installation disk for you. However, because Network Client Administrator is not available on beta release versions of Windows NT 5.0, you must prepare the floppy disk manually. This document explains how to create a network installation disk and how to use it to install Windows NT.
You might need to create several network installation disks. Each network installation disk includes hardware-specific files for one model of network adapter. If the computers on which you plan to install Windows NT by this method have different network adapters, you will need a different network installation disk for each model of adapter.

Note
If a computer has more than one network adapter installed, you only need to include on the network installation disk the hardware-specific files for the network adapter that you will use to connect to the network. After Windows NT is installed, you can configure the other network adapters.

The procedure for preparing a network installation disk consists of the following steps.
	Install MS-DOS on a floppy disk.
	Copy the files required by the MS-DOS network client to the floppy disk.
	Copy the files required by TCP/IP to the floppy disk.
	Copy the hardware-specific files for a network adapter to the floppy disk.
	Edit the configuration files.
	Use the network installation disk to install Windows NT 5.0.

The following sections describe these procedures in detail.
Before You Begin
You must complete the following tasks before you prepare a network installation disk.
	Compile a list of the network adapters installed in computers on which you are using a network installation disk. Each model of network adapter requires a different network installation disk with different hardware-specific files.
	Locate a computer running MS-DOS 6.2.2, if possible. The MS-DOS 6.2.2 operating system is the most reliable source for creating network installation disks. Because Windows NT does not require an MS-DOS partition, most computers running Windows NT are not suitable for this task.

Note
Computers running Windows 95 have an MS-DOS 7.0 partition. You can use a computer running MS-DOS 7.0 to create a network installation disk for Windows NT. However, the lock command in MS-DOS 7.0 can lock a computer's hard disk drive and prevent the Windows NT Setup program from copying required files to the drive. 
If you must use MS-DOS 7.0 to create a network installation disk, at the top of the Autoexec.bat file included on the network installation disk, issue the unlock command.
For more information, see "Troubleshooting Tips," later in this document..





Installing MS-DOS
A network installation disk is configured as an MS-DOS bootable disk. The first step in the process of creating a network installation disk is to install a minimal MS-DOS system on the floppy disk, that is, to configure a DOS boot sector on the floppy disk and to transfer MS-DOS system boot files to the disk.
You install MS-DOS on the floppy disk by formatting the floppy disk as a system disk. You can use any computer with MS-DOS and a floppy disk drive for this task. You do not have to use the computer on which you are installing Windows NT.

Note
The instructions in this document assume that the floppy disk drive is designated as drive A. If it is not, substitute the drive letter of your floppy disk drive for all instances of a: in these instructions.

To install MS-DOS on the floppy disk
1.  Locate a computer with MS-DOS, preferably MS-DOS 6.2.2. Start the computer and select MS-DOS during system startup. 
2.  Insert a high-density floppy disk in the floppy disk drive.
3.  At the command prompt, type:
format a: /s
This command creates an MS-DOS boot sector on the floppy disk and transfers the following files to the disk.
	Io.sys
	Msdos.sys
	Drvspace.bin
	Command.com
When the transfer is complete, the system displays the following at the command prompt:
Format complete.
System transferred


Tip
Io.sys, Msdos.sys, and Drvspace.sys are hidden, system files. To see these files in MS-DOS, at the command prompt, type:
dir a: /a
To see these files in File Manager, from the View menu, click By File Type, and then click Show Hidden/System Files.
To see these files in Windows 95 Explorer or Windows NT Explorer, from the View menu, click Options, click the View tab, and click Show all files.

Copying Files for the MS-DOS Network Client
The MS-DOS network client requires that certain files be present on the network installation disk in order to connect a computer to the network. With the exception of System.ini, you can copy these files from the Clients subdirectory of Windows NT Server CD, version 4.0 or earlier and modify them to suit your installation.
Copy the following files to your floppy disk or use a text editor to create them. The text required in these files is provided in "Editing the Text Files," later in this document.
	Autoexec.bat
	Config.sys

Then, create a subdirectory on the floppy disk called Net, and copy the following files from the Clients subdirectory of a Windows NT Server CD version 4.0 or earlier into the Net subdirectory:
	Emm386.exe
	Himem.sys
	Ifshlp.sys
	Ndishlp.sys
	Net.exe
	Net.msg
	Protman.dos
	Protman.exe
	Protocol.ini
	Setup.inf
	Shares.pwl
	Wcnet.inf
	Wcsetup.inf
	Wfwsys.cfg

Lastly, add a System.ini file to the Net subdirectory. This file is not provided on the Windows NT Server CD, but you can use a text editor to create this file. The text for the System.ini file is provided in "Editing the Text Files," later in this document.
Copying Files for TCP/IP
Most network-based installations of Windows NT use the TCP/IP network protocol. TCP/IP requires the following files on the network installation disk. You can copy these files from the Clients subdirectory of  Windows NT Server CD version 4.0 or earlier.
	Emsbfr.exe
	Lmhosts
	Nemm.dos
	Netbind.com
	Networks
	Nmtsr.exe
	Protocol
	Tcpdrv.dos
	Tcptsr.exe
	Tcputils.ini
	Tinyrfc.exe
	Umb.com

These TCP/IP files are common to all network adapters. Do not modify these files.
Copying Files for a Network Adapter
At this point, the network installation disk you have created contains only common files. The remaining files for the network installation disk are specific to the network adapter on the computer on which you are installing Windows NT. Most network adapters require only one file, a real-mode MS-DOS driver for the network adapter.
These hardware-specific files are usually included with the network adapter. If you do not have these files, you can obtain them from the manufacturer of the network adapter. Often, you can download them from the manufacturer's Web site.
You must prepare a network installation disk for each model of network adapter that you will use to connect a computer to the network. For each network installation disk you create, copy the files required for one network adapter to the Net directory on the network installation disk.

Note
Prepare a separate network installation disk for each network adapter represented in your enterprise. You cannot install the files for more than one type of network adapter on a network installation disk.

The following table shows the real-mode driver files required for some commonly used network adapters.

Caution
This table is provided for your convenience. It might not contain the most current information for network adapters supported by Windows NT 5.0. Consult the manufacturer to determine the required real-mode driver for your network adapter.

Editing the Configuration Files
After copying the required files to your floppy disk, you must edit the configuration files to add the commands that will connect the computer to the network and begin the installation process.
This section includes text for the following files.
	Autoexec.bat
	Config.sys
	System.ini

You can use a text editor, such as Notepad, to copy the required text directly from this document and paste it into your configuration files.

Note
If the floppy disk drive in the computer on which you are installing Windows NT is not designated as drive A, substitute the drive letter of your floppy disk drive for all instances of a: in the following sections.

Autoexec.bat
You can create a new Autoexec.bat file, or you can edit the Autoexec.bat file you copied, and replace the text it contains with the following text.
path=a:\net
a:\net\net initialize
a:\net\netbind.com
a:\net\umb.com
a:\net\tcptsr.exe
a:\net\tinyrfc.exe
a:\net\nmtsr.exe
a:\net\emsbfr.exe
a:\net\net start
net use z:\\<server>\<share>
echo Running setup...
z:\<path>setup.exe /$

Replace <server> and <share> with the name of the server and shared directory containing the Windows NT setup files, and replace <path> with the complete path to the Windows NT setup files.
Config.sys
You can create a new Config.sys file, or you can edit the Config.sys file you copied, and replace the text it contains with the following text.
files=30
device=a:\net\ifshlp.sys
lastdrive=z
DEVICE=A:\NET\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=A:\NET\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
DOS=HIGH,UMB

System.ini
The System.ini file identifies the computer and user to the network. This file is not included on the Windows NT Server CD, but you can use a text editor, such as Notepad, to copy the text below to a file you create, and save it as System.ini. Be sure to place the file in the Net subdirectory on the network installation disk.
The following text must appear in the System.ini file on the network installation disk.
[network]
filesharing=no
printsharing=no
autologon=yes
computername=<computername>
lanroot=A:\NET
username=<username>
workgroup=<domainname>
reconnect=no
dospophotkey=N
lmlogon=0
logondomain=<domainname>
preferredredir=full
autostart=full
maxconnections=8

[network drivers]
netcard=<real-mode driver filename>
transport=tcpdrv.dos,nemm.dos
devdir=A:\NET
LoadRMDrivers=yes

[Password Lists]

Replace <real-mode driver filename> with the name of the real-mode driver file you copied to the network installation disk.
You can replace the <computername>, <username>, and <domainname> entries in System.ini with appropriate names for the computer on which you are installing Windows NT, or you can enter generic names.
If you enter generic names, you can use the network installation disk on many different computers without editing the System.ini file before each use. Later, after Windows NT is installed, you can use Network in Control Panel to insert the correct names for each computer.
If you use generic names, make certain that the computer name in System.ini is unique while the network installation disk is in use, and that the user name is the name of a user that has permission to connect to the network and read files from the shared directory.
Using the Network Installation Disk
To use the network installation disk, turn off power to the computer on which you want to install Windows NT, insert the disk in the floppy disk drive of the computer, and then turn on power to the computer.
The computer starts by using the MS-DOS instructions on the network installation disk. The instructions on the disk direct the MS-DOS system to connect to the network and to the shared directory (specified in the System.ini file) on which the Windows NT setup files reside. After the setup files are located (in the path specified in the System.ini file), the Windows NT Setup program starts.
Follow the instructions in Setup to install Windows NT on the computer. From this point forward, the installation procedure is the same as if you were installing Windows NT from a Windows NT Server CD or Windows NT Workstation CD.
When Setup is complete, use Network in Control Panel to enter a unique computer name, as well as a user name and domain name for the computer.
Troubleshooting Tips
If the network installation disk does not work correctly, try the following troubleshooting tips.
	Make sure that BIOS boot sequence on the computer in which you are inserting the network installation disk includes FDD (floppy disk drive). If the computer has an operating system on its hard disk, make sure that FDD appears before HDD in the boot sequence.
	Make sure that the user listed in System.ini has permission to read files from the shared network directory.
	Make sure that the computer name in System.ini is unique on the network.
	The real-mode driver files might include default settings. Examine the files to be certain that they include variations for your network. For specific information, consult the documentation for the network adapter.
	If you used a computer running MS-DOS 7.0 to create the network installation disk, and the system displays messages indicating that Setup cannot write to the computer's hard disk, MS-DOS 7.0 might have locked your computer's hard disk.
To resolve this problem, add the following text to the top of the Autoexec.bat file on the network installation disk.
unlock c:

If you are installing Windows NT on a drive other than the C drive, you must unlock both drives. Add a second command to unlock the affected drive, as follows:
unlock <drive letter>:

Previous Beta Users
-------------------
If you had installed a previous beta of the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for
Windows for Workgroups product, you may encounter one of the following
errors:

  "Setup Error 108: Could not create or open the protocol.ini file."
  "Setup Error 110: Could not find or open win.ini."

If this happens do the following:

1) Remove any previous versions of Microsoft TCP/IP-32.
2) Exit Network Setup and restart your system.
3) Rename any OEMx.INF (where x is any number) files that are in your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
4) Go back into Network Setup and install Microsoft TCP/IP-32 following
   the installation instructions in the manual.

Mosaic
------
NCSA's Win32s version of their popular Mosaic application requires that
you pick up version 115a or greater of the Win32s distribution to function
correctly.

DHCP Automatic Configuration
----------------------------
DHCP is a new TCP/IP protocol that provides the ability to acquire TCP/IP
addressing and configuration dynamically with no user intervention.  DHCP
depends on your network administrator to set up a DHCP server on your
network.  A DHCP server is scheduled to ship as part of Windows NT(TM)
Server version 3.5.

If you enable automatic DHCP configuration without a DHCP server available
on your network, the following message will appear after approximately a
10 second black-screen delay during the Windows for Workgroups booting
process:

  "The DHCP client was unable to obtain an IP network address from a DHCP
   server. Do you want to see future DHCP messages?"

This message means that TCP/IP has initialized but without any addressing
information.  If you are running TCP/IP as your only protocol, you will
not have access to the network.  This situation requires that you go back
to the TCP/IP configuration settings, disable DHCP, and manually specify
your TCP/IP network parameters.  If you are running multiple protocols,
you should have access to your network with these.

If you do have a DHCP server on your network and this message appears,
this indicates that the server was unavailable and that your lease has
expired.  DHCP will (in the background) continue to try to acquire a valid
lease while Windows for Workgroups continues to run (although you will not
have TCP/IP functionality).  If you are running with DHCP automatic
configuration, use the IPCONFIG utility to learn your IP configuration.

DHCP Options
------------
The following changes are not reflected in the TCP/IP-32 documentation.

Currently Microsoft DHCP clients support only the following options:

- DHCP protocol options
	- DHCP message type (53)
	- Lease Time (51), Renewal Time (58), Rebind Time (59)

- Information options:
	- Subnet Mask (1)
	- Default Router (3)
	- DNS Server (6)
	- WINS Server (NetBIOS Name Server) (44)
	- NetBIOS Node Type (46)
	- NetBIOS Scope Id (47)

Any other options received by the client are ignored and discarded.


No Option Overlays - Option Limit Is 336 Bytes
----------------------------------------------
The DHCP client does not recognize option overlays.  If a non-Microsoft
server is sending the options, make sure that either all the options fit
within the standard option field, or at least that those used by the
Microsoft clients (listed above) are conta ined in the standard Option
field. Since the Microsoft client only supports a subset of the defined
DHCP option types, 336 bytes should be sufficient for any configuration.

Ipconfig - Moving Client to New Address
---------------------------------------
When a DHCP client is moved to a new reserved address or is moved from an
address to make way for an exclusion or another client's reservation, the
client should first release its current address using ipconfig /release.
This may be followed by ipconfig /renew to get a new address.

ARP Conflicts - Report to DHCP Server Administrator
---------------------------------------------------
Before the TCP/IP stack comes up with the address acquired via DHCP, the
stack ARPs for the address.  If a machine is already running with this
address, the client will display a popup informing the user of the address
conflict.  Users should contact the CP server administrator when this
occurs.	Once the server has excluded the conflicting address, the client
should get a new address using ipconfig /renew.  If this is unsuccessful,
the client may need to reboot.


NetBIOS over TCP/IP
-------------------
Multihomed Computer NetBIOS Node Type

A computer can be one of four NetBIOS node types: broadcast node, mixed
node, point-to-point node, or hybrid node.  The node type cannot be
specified per network adapter card.  In some circumstances, it may be
desirable to have one or more network adapter c ards function as broadcast
nodes and other network adapter cards to function as hybrids.

You accomplish this by setting the node type to broadcast node, and
configuring WINS name server addresses for the network adapter cards that
will function as hybrids.  The presence of the WINS addresses will
effectively override the broadcast node setting for the adapters on which
they are set.

To make an adapter a broadcast node, configure DHCP to set the node type
to Bnode, or in the absence of DHCP, the computer will assume Bnode
behavior by default.

Including Remote LMHOSTS Files

You must modify the Registry of a remote computer if network clients will
#INCLUDE the LMHOSTS file on the remote Windows NT computer.  The share
containing the LMHOSTS file must be in the Null Sessions list on the
Server by adding the share name to the following Windows NT Registry key:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
	\LanManServer\Parameters\NullSessionShares


Microsoft TCP/IP Workstations with UB NetBIOS Name Servers
----------------------------------------------------------
The Microsoft clients can be configured to use a UB name server by adding
the SYSTEM.INI parameter RefreshOpCode under the [NBT] section.  Set its
value to 9 to interoperate with UB name servers.


NetDDE Applications Communicating over Subnets via LMHOSTS
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are connecting to a remote machine via a NetDDE application, using
a #PRE LMHOSTS entry, you must have a separate entry specifying a special
character in the 16th byte:

138.121.43.100  REMOTEDDE       #PRE
138.121.43.100  "REMOTEDDE      \0x1F"

A special entry is not required if #PRE is not used.


Browsing Resources on Remote IP Subnetworks
-------------------------------------------
Browsing remote IP subnetworks requires a Windows NT computer on the local
subnet.


Using File Manager to Access Servers Specified in LMHOSTS
---------------------------------------------------------
Reading and parsing LMHOSTS to resolve a name is done by the NBT driver at
run time.  This operation is not permissible under certain conditions.
One such condition commonly encountered is when a network connection is
attempted from the File Manager.  The result is that the name is reported
as 'not resolved' even if the name exists in LMHOSTS file (since the
driver wasn't even allowed to open LMHOSTS file).  The workaround for such
conditions is to put a #PRE against the name in the LMHOSTS file.  This
causes the name to be stored in the name cache when the machine is first
initialized, so the name gets resolved without the driver having to open
LMHOSTS at run time.


IP Routing
----------
Multiple Default Gateways in Microsoft TCP/IP Act as Backup Gateways When
more than one default gateway is specified for a given IP network or for
multiple IP networks on different network cards, the first default gateway
for the first network card is always used to route IP network traffic.
All the subsequent gateways are used as backup when the first default
gateway is discovered to be unavailable.  The Dead Gateway Detection
mechanism is used only with TCP (connection-oriented traffic).  Therefore,
utilities like PING will only use the first default gateway.  Notice that
t his only applies to IP datagrams that have to be routed to a remote
network (that is, to a network to which the workstation is not directly
connected).

FTP
---
FTP is implemented in a Windows console in this release.  It is not
presently hooked to the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help file, although the Help
file does have FTP command summaries in it.  Many of the documented
command line options are supported, although they require you to modify
your FTP Program Item manually.

The FTP application which ships with this product does not support the "!"
command, which typically invokes a user shell.

ODI Driver Support
------------------
Due to system restrictions, TCP/IP-32 cannot support more than one network
adapter using ODI drivers.  Multihomed configurations are supported using
NDIS drivers only.

If after installing TCP/IP-32 you have problems accessing the network over
your ODI drivers, please make sure that the syntax and frame types listed
in your NET.CFG file are correct for your network.

DNS Resolution Hierarchy
------------------------
The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 stack uses various means to resolve a host name to
get the IP address of a certain host.  The various mechanisms used are
Local Cached Information, Hosts File, DNS Servers, and NetBIOS name
resolution mechanisms.  The default resolution order for resolving a host
name is Local Cached Information -> Hosts File -> DNS Servers -> NetBt
(NetBIOS over TCP/IP).  NetBIOS over TCP/IP name resolution can consist of
local subnet broadcasts, and/or querying the Windows Internet Names Server
(WINS) running on Windows NT Servers.

\Windows directory. 

To open a readme file after you install Windows 95:
1. Click the Start menu.
2. Click Run.
3. Type the name of the readme file.

Even if you haven't installed Windows 95 yet, you can still open a 
readme file.

To open a readme file before you install Windows 95:

If you purchased Windows 95 on floppy disks:
--------------------------------------------
1. Insert Disk 1 into drive A (or whatever drive you prefer).
2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:

   a:extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab filename.txt

For example, if you want to open General.txt, you would type:

   a:extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab general.txt

3. Change to the \Windows directory.
4. At the command prompt, type the following:

   edit filename.txt

If you purchased Windows 95 on a CD-ROM:
----------------------------------------
1. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive (drive x in this example).
2. Change to the \Win95 directory on your CD-ROM drive.
2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:

   extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab filename.txt

For example, if you want to open General.txt, you would type:

   extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab general.txt

3. Change to the Windows directory on your C drive.
4. At the command prompt, type the following:

   edit filename.txt


UNINSTALLING WINDOWS 95
=======================

During Setup, you have the option of saving your system files so 
that you can uninstall Windows 95 later. If you want to be able to 
uninstall Windows 95 later, choose Yes. Setup will save your system 
files in a hidden, compressed file. If you don't need to be able to 
uninstall Windows 95 later, choose No.

You will not see this Setup option if:
- You are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows 95.
- You are installing to a new directory.
- You are running a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0.

NOTE:The uninstall files must be saved on a local hard drive. You  
can't save them to a network drive or a floppy disk. If you have  
multiple local drives, you will be able to select the one you want  
to save the uninstall information on.

To uninstall Windows 95 and completely restore your computer to its
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x, carry out the following 
procedure:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click 
   Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then click 
   Remove.

Or, if you are having problems starting Windows 95, use your startup
disk to start your computer, and then run UNINSTAL from the startup
disk.

NOTE: The uninstall program needs to shut down Windows 95. If there is 
a problem with this on your computer, restart your computer and press
F8 when you see the message "Starting Windows 95." Then choose Command 
Prompt Only, and run UNINSTAL from the command prompt.

If Windows 95 is running and you want to remove the uninstall files to 
free up 6 to 9 MB of disk space, carry out the following procedure:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click 
   Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS System
   Files, and then click Remove.

You will no longer be able to uninstall Windows 95.

   (if drive C is the boot drive). For example, if you boot from drive C, 
   append the following to the line that starts with PATH:

      \srvtools

Note
You must restart the computer for the new path to take effect. 

Verifying your password for Windows NT Server Tools
===================================================
When you use the Windows NT Server Tools on a client computer running 
Windows 95, a message appears at times, asking you to log on or enter your 
password. When you run the Windows NT versions of Server Tools on a 
computer running Windows NT, you do not need to supply your password 
separately. These password prompts ensure that you have administrative 
privilege for the server you administer.


Establishing trust relationships
================================
When you use the Windows NT Server Tools, you can create trust 
relationships between domains but you cannot verify them. Be careful to 
enter correct passwords for the trust relationships.

Logging on before using Windows NT Server Tools
===============================================
If you are not logged on and you start any of the Windows NT Server Tools, 
you will get a message that says that the computer is not logged on to the 
network. First log on to the network and then run any of the Windows NT 
Server Tools.

To remove  Windows NT Server Tools
==================================
1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.
4. In Uninstall, click Windows NT Server Tools, and then click Add/Remove.

Note
If you want to remove the directory for Windows NT Server Tools (usually 
C:\Srvtools), you must do this manually.

Understanding Windows NT Server Tools
=====================================
Windows NT Server Tools enable you to use a computer running Windows 95 to 
administer servers running Microsoft File And Print Services For NetWare, 
and Microsoft Windows NT Server. Windows NT Server Tools include Event 
Viewer, Server Manager, User Manager, and extensions to Windows 95 
Explorer. You can use these extensions to edit security properties of 
printers and Windows NT File System (NTFS) file objects on computers 
running Windows NT and to administer File And Print Services for NetWare 
and NetWare-enabled users.

When you install Windows NT Server Tools, the installation program:
* Copies the Windows NT Server Tools files to C:\Srvtools (if C: is the 
  boot drive).
* Adds "Windows NT Server Tools" to the Start button Programs menu.
* Adds extensions to Windows Explorer that enable you to change security 
  settings when viewing an NTFS drive or a print queue on a computer 
  running Windows NT.

Note
* To use any of the Windows NT Server Tools you must have administrative 
  privilege at the computer you choose to administer.

To use Event Viewer
===================
1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT Server Tools, and 
   click Event Viewer.
2. Enter the name of a computer running Windows NT Server or Windows NT 
   Workstation.

To use Server Manager
=====================
1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT Server Tools, and 
   click Server Manager.
2. Select a computer to administer. 
3. To see computers in another domain, click Select Domain on the Computer 
   menu.

To use User Manager for Domains
===============================
1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT Server Tools, and 
   click User Manager For Domains.
2. Click a user account or group to administer. 
3. To see accounts in another domain, click Select Domain on the User menu.

To edit security properties of printers or NTFS-file objects on computers
running Windows NT 
=========================================================================

1. Double-click Network Neighborhood, and then double-click the name of the 
   computer to be administered. 
2. Click the printer or Windows NT File System (NTFS)-file object you want 
   to administer, and then click Properties.
3. Click the Security tab. 
4. Make the changes you want to the permissions, auditing, and object-
   ownership settings.

Notes
* The following methods for selecting an object to administer do not work:
* Administering print queues through the Printers list in My Computer; 
  these print queue objects represent print queues local to your Windows 95 
  computer, even if the queue is redirected to a Windows NT Server or 
  Windows NT Workstation print queue.
* Using the Windows 3.x Print Manager, which no longer exists in 
  Windows 95; the Printers icon in the Main group of Program Manager is 
  just a shortcut to the Printers list in My Computer.
* Using File Manager. Installing Windows NT Server Tools does not add a 
  Security menu to File Manager as it did for Windows 3.x.

To share FPNW volumes and manage shared volumes
===============================================
1. Connect to the server running File and Print Services for NetWare. 
   For example, to connect from the command line, type:

      net use z: \\servername\c$

2. In Windows Explorer, right-click the drive for the server running File 
   And Print Services For NetWare, and then click Properties on the menu 
   that appears.
3. Click the FPNW tab.
   A dialog box appears, containing buttons that enable you to manage 
   shared volumes and to share directories as File And Print Services For 
   NetWare volumes.

Note
* For other administrative tasks, use Server Manager and User Manager, 
  which include options for administering File and Print Services for 
  NetWare, and NetWare-enabled users. These are the same Server Manager and 
  User Manager options that are available on computers running Windows NT 
  Server with File And Print Services For NetWare.

RELEASE NOTES FOR MICROSOFT(R) TCP/IP-32 FOR WINDOWS(TM) FOR WORKGROUPS 3.11
			
                    PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT

General
-------
This product is compatible with, and supported exclusively on, the
Microsoft Windows For Workgroups 3.11 platform.

If you are running a different TCP/IP product on your system, you must
remove it before installing Microsoft TCP/IP-32.  If you experience
difficulties with another vendor's product, remove the existing TCP/IP
stack, exit Network Setup completely, reboot your system, and then proceed
to add the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 drivers by following the instructions given
in the documentation.

Known Problems
--------------
There have been a number of reports on IBM TokenRing, EtherLink III cards,
and ODI drivers that are related to bugs in drivers other than TCP/IP-32.

Previous Beta Users
-------------------
If you had installed a previous beta of the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for
Windows for Workgroups product, you may encounter one of the following
errors:

  "Setup Error 108: Could not create or open the protocol.ini file."
  "Setup Error 110: Could not find or open win.ini."

If this happens do the following:

1) Remove any previous versions of Microsoft TCP/IP-32.
2) Exit Network Setup and restart your system.
3) Rename any OEMx.INF (where x is any number) files that are in your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
4) Go back into Network Setup and install Microsoft TCP/IP-32 following
   the installation instructions in the manual.

Mosaic
------
NCSA's Win32s version of their popular Mosaic application requires that
you pick up version 115a or greater of the Win32s distribution to function
correctly.

DHCP Automatic Configuration
----------------------------
DHCP is a new TCP/IP protocol that provides the ability to acquire TCP/IP
addressing and configuration dynamically with no user intervention.  DHCP
depends on your network administrator to set up a DHCP server on your
network.  A DHCP server is scheduled to ship as part of Windows NT(TM)
Server version 3.5.

If you enable automatic DHCP configuration without a DHCP server available
on your network, the following message will appear after approximately a
10 second black-screen delay during the Windows for Workgroups booting
process:

  "The DHCP client was unable to obtain an IP network address from a DHCP
   server. Do you want to see future DHCP messages?"

This message means that TCP/IP has initialized but without any addressing
information.  If you are running TCP/IP as your only protocol, you will
not have access to the network.  This situation requires that you go back
to the TCP/IP configuration settings, disable DHCP, and manually specify
your TCP/IP network parameters.  If you are running multiple protocols,
you should have access to your network with these.

If you do have a DHCP server on your network and this message appears,
this indicates that the server was unavailable and that your lease has
expired.  DHCP will (in the background) continue to try to acquire a valid
lease while Windows for Workgroups continues to run (although you will not
have TCP/IP functionality).  If you are running with DHCP automatic
configuration, use the IPCONFIG utility to learn your IP configuration.

DHCP Options
------------
The following changes are not reflected in the TCP/IP-32 documentation.

Currently Microsoft DHCP clients support only the following options:

- DHCP protocol options
	- DHCP message type (53)
	- Lease Time (51), Renewal Time (58), Rebind Time (59)

- Information options:
	- Subnet Mask (1)
	- Default Router (3)
	- DNS Server (6)
	- WINS Server (NetBIOS Name Server) (44)
	- NetBIOS Node Type (46)
	- NetBIOS Scope Id (47)

Any other options received by the client are ignored and discarded.


No Option Overlays - Option Limit Is 336 Bytes
----------------------------------------------
The DHCP client does not recognize option overlays.  If a non-Microsoft
server is sending the options, make sure that either all the options fit
within the standard option field, or at least that those used by the
Microsoft clients (listed above) are conta ined in the standard Option
field. Since the Microsoft client only supports a subset of the defined
DHCP option types, 336 bytes should be sufficient for any configuration.

Ipconfig - Moving Client to New Address
---------------------------------------
When a DHCP client is moved to a new reserved address or is moved from an
address to make way for an exclusion or another client's reservation, the
client should first release its current address using ipconfig /release.
This may be followed by ipconfig /renew to get a new address.

ARP Conflicts - Report to DHCP Server Administrator
---------------------------------------------------
Before the TCP/IP stack comes up with the address acquired via DHCP, the
stack ARPs for the address.  If a machine is already running with this
address, the client will display a popup informing the user of the address
conflict.  Users should contact the CP server administrator when this
occurs.	Once the server has excluded the conflicting address, the client
should get a new address using ipconfig /renew.  If this is unsuccessful,
the client may need to reboot.


NetBIOS over TCP/IP
-------------------
Multihomed Computer NetBIOS Node Type

A computer can be one of four NetBIOS node types: broadcast node, mixed
node, point-to-point node, or hybrid node.  The node type cannot be
specified per network adapter card.  In some circumstances, it may be
desirable to have one or more network adapter c ards function as broadcast
nodes and other network adapter cards to function as hybrids.

You accomplish this by setting the node type to broadcast node, and
configuring WINS name server addresses for the network adapter cards that
will function as hybrids.  The presence of the WINS addresses will
effectively override the broadcast node setting for the adapters on which
they are set.

To make an adapter a broadcast node, configure DHCP to set the node type
to Bnode, or in the absence of DHCP, the computer will assume Bnode
behavior by default.

Including Remote LMHOSTS Files

You must modify the Registry of a remote computer if network clients will
#INCLUDE the LMHOSTS file on the remote Windows NT computer.  The share
containing the LMHOSTS file must be in the Null Sessions list on the
Server by adding the share name to the following Windows NT Registry key:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
	\LanManServer\Parameters\NullSessionShares


Microsoft TCP/IP Workstations with UB NetBIOS Name Servers
----------------------------------------------------------
The Microsoft clients can be configured to use a UB name server by adding
the SYSTEM.INI parameter RefreshOpCode under the [NBT] section.  Set its
value to 9 to interoperate with UB name servers.


NetDDE Applications Communicating over Subnets via LMHOSTS
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are connecting to a remote machine via a NetDDE application, using
a #PRE LMHOSTS entry, you must have a separate entry specifying a special
character in the 16th byte:

138.121.43.100  REMOTEDDE       #PRE
138.121.43.100  "REMOTEDDE      \0x1F"

A special entry is not required if #PRE is not used.


Browsing Resources on Remote IP Subnetworks
-------------------------------------------
Browsing remote IP subnetworks requires a Windows NT computer on the local
subnet.


Using File Manager to Access Servers Specified in LMHOSTS
---------------------------------------------------------
Reading and parsing LMHOSTS to resolve a name is done by the NBT driver at
run time.  This operation is not permissible under certain conditions.
One such condition commonly encountered is when a network connection is
attempted from the File Manager.  The result is that the name is reported
as 'not resolved' even if the name exists in LMHOSTS file (since the
driver wasn't even allowed to open LMHOSTS file).  The workaround for such
conditions is to put a #PRE against the name in the LMHOSTS file.  This
causes the name to be stored in the name cache when the machine is first
initialized, so the name gets resolved without the driver having to open
LMHOSTS at run time.


IP Routing
----------
Multiple Default Gateways in Microsoft TCP/IP Act as Backup Gateways When
more than one default gateway is specified for a given IP network or for
multiple IP networks on different network cards, the first default gateway
for the first network card is always used to route IP network traffic.
All the subsequent gateways are used as backup when the first default
gateway is discovered to be unavailable.  The Dead Gateway Detection
mechanism is used only with TCP (connection-oriented traffic).  Therefore,
utilities like PING will only use the first default gateway.  Notice that
t his only applies to IP datagrams that have to be routed to a remote
network (that is, to a network to which the workstation is not directly
connected).

FTP
---
FTP is implemented in a Windows console in this release.  It is not
presently hooked to the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help file, although the Help
file does have FTP command summaries in it.  Many of the documented
command line options are supported, although they require you to modify
your FTP Program Item manually.

The FTP application which ships with this product does not support the "!"
command, which typically invokes a user shell.

ODI Driver Support
------------------
Due to system restrictions, TCP/IP-32 cannot support more than one network
adapter using ODI drivers.  Multihomed configurations are supported using
NDIS drivers only.

If after installing TCP/IP-32 you have problems accessing the network over
your ODI drivers, please make sure that the syntax and frame types listed
in your NET.CFG file are correct for your network.

DNS Resolution Hierarchy
------------------------
The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 stack uses various means to resolve a host name to
get the IP address of a certain host.  The various mechanisms used are
Local Cached Information, Hosts File, DNS Servers, and NetBIOS name
resolution mechanisms.  The default resolution order for resolving a host
name is Local Cached Information -> Hosts File -> DNS Servers -> NetBt
(NetBIOS over TCP/IP).  NetBIOS over TCP/IP name resolution can consist of
local subnet broadcasts, and/or querying the Windows Internet Names Server
(WINS) running on Windows NT Servers.

SETUP.TXT
=========

This file contains information about problems that may occur while
you are running Windows 95 Setup.

NOTE: It is recommended that you check your hard disk for viruses
before setting up Windows 95. If you have MS-DOS 6.x, you should
run MSAV before running Setup.

You should also turn off any screen savers you have running, and
disable any anti-virus software that is running before you start Setup.


FINDING AND FIXING HARD-DISK PROBLEMS DURING SETUP (USING SCANDISK)
===================================================================
Windows 95 Setup automatically runs ScanDisk to check for problems
on your hard disk(s). If there are problems, Setup cannot continue
until they are fixed.

NOTE: The MS-DOS-based version of ScanDisk that Setup runs may detect
long filename errors, but it cannot correct them. These errors will
not prevent Setup from proceeding, but once it completes, you should
run the new Windows version of ScanDisk from within Windows 95 to
correct these errors.

Fixing Hard-Disk Problems
-------------------------
If you see a message during Setup that says you must run ScanDisk to
fix problems on your hard disk, follow these steps to fix the problems.

If you are setting up Windows 95 over MS-DOS or a previous version of
Windows, such as Windows 3.1:

1. Quit Windows.
2. If you are setting up from floppy disks, insert Setup Disk 1 into 
   the drive, and then type the following at the command prompt:

	a:scandisk.exe /all

   where "a" is the drive that contains the Windows disk.

   If you are setting up from a CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM and then type
   the following:

        f:\win95\scandisk.exe /all

   where "f" is the drive that contains the CD-ROM.

4. Follow the instructions on your screen and fix any problems that
   ScanDisk finds.
5. Start Windows, and then run Setup again.

If you are setting up Windows 95 over a previous version of Windows 95:

1. Quit Setup.
2. On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point 
   to System Tools, and then click ScanDisk.
3. Check your your hard disk(s) and any host drives you have for errors,
   and repair any problems found.

NOTE: If you are running Setup from MS-DOS, ScanDisk will run and you'll
be able to fix most problems from within Setup.

Problems Running ScanDisk
-------------------------
If you get a message during Setup saying that there is not enough memory
to run ScanDisk, free some conventional and/or upper memory, and then run
Setup again. If you have MS-DOS 6.x, try running MEMMAKER to free memory.

If you still don't have enough memory, or if you have other problems while
Setup is running ScanDisk, then you can bypass ScanDisk in Setup by running
Setup with the /IS option. To do this, type the following command:

	setup /is

NOTE: Bypassing ScanDisk during Setup is not recommended. If you do, 
there may be problems with your hard disk that could cause Windows 95
not to install or run correctly.

If you still have problems after running Setup with the /IS option, try 
running Setup with the /IQ option. To do this, type the following command:

        setup /is /iq


UNINSTALLING WINDOWS 95
=======================

During Setup, you'll have the option of saving your system files so that
you can uninstall Windows 95 later. If you want to be able to uninstall 
Windows 95 later, choose Yes. Setup will save your system files in a 
hidden, compressed file. If you don't need to be able to uninstall 
Windows 95 later, choose No.

You will not see this Setup option if:
- You are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows 95.
- You are installing to a new directory.
- You are running a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0.

NOTE: The uninstall files must be saved on a local hard drive. You 
cannot save them to a network drive or a floppy disk. If you have 
multiple local drives, you will be able to select the one you want to 
save the uninstall information on.

NOTE: If you see a message during Setup about not being able to save 
your system files, see the "Setup Error Messages" section later in this 
document.

To uninstall Windows 95 and completely restore your system to its
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control 
   Panel.
2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then click 
   Remove.

Or, if you are having problems starting Windows 95, use your startup
disk to start your computer, and then run UNINSTAL from the startup
disk.

NOTE: The uninstall program needs to shut down Windows 95. If there is 
a problem with this on your computer, restart your computer and press
F8 when you see the message "Starting Windows 95." Then choose
Command Prompt Only and run UNINSTAL from the command prompt.

If Setup did not complete successfully and you want to restore your
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows, you can run UNINSTAL from the
\Windows\Command directory on your hard disk, or from your startup disk
if you created one.

If you saved your files on a drive other than C, you can use the /w 
option to specify the drive where the files are located. For example:

        uninstal /w e:

where e: is the drive containing your previous system files that were
saved.

If Windows 95 is running and you want to remove the uninstall files to 
free up disk space (6 to 9MB), follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control 
   Panel.
2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS System 
   Files, and then click Remove.

You will no longer be able to uninstall Windows 95.


IF YOU HAVE A COMPRESSED DRIVE
==============================

If you have used compression software to compress your hard disk, you
may get a message saying that there is not enough space on the host
partition of the compressed drive. Setup may have to copy some files
to your startup drive, the host for your startup drive, or the host
for your Windows drive. If you get this message, you should free up
some space on the specified drive, and then run Setup again. Try one
of the following:

- If you are setting up Windows on a compressed drive, try setting it
  up on an uncompressed drive if possible.
- Delete any unneeded files on your host partition.
- If you are running Windows 3.1 and have a permanent swap file, try
  making it smaller. In Control Panel, double-click the 386 Enhanced
  icon, and then click Virtual Memory. Then modify the size of your
  swap file.
- Use your disk compression software to free up some space on the host
  drive for the compressed drive. If you compressed your drive by using
  DriveSpace or DoubleSpace, follow these steps:

  1. Quit Windows.
  2. Run Drvspace.exe or Dblspace.exe.
  3. Select the compressed drive on whose host you want to free space.
  4. On the Drive menu, click Change Size.

  If you used other compression software, such as Stacker, consult the
  documentation that came with it.

NOTE: If you notice a discrepancy in the amount of free space reported
by Setup and the amount of space you think is available on your host
drive, it may be because Windows uses some space for creating a swap
file. This may not appear to take up any space when Windows is not
running. 

NOTE: If you create a startup disk during Setup, make sure you do not
use a compressed disk for the startup disk.

If You Have SuperStor Compression
---------------------------------
If you have compressed your hard disk by using SuperStor, Setup may not
be able to find your startup drive and install Windows 95. If you get a
message about this during Setup, uncompress your disk and remove 
SuperStor, then run Setup again.

If You Have XtraDrive Compression
---------------------------------
If you have compressed your hard disk by using XtraDrive and you are
upgrading a previous version of Windows, Setup will not be able to
install Windows 95 unless you turn off XtraDrive's write-cache. To
turn this off, carry out the following procedure:

1. Quit Windows.
2. Run Vmu.exe (XtraDrive's Volume Maintenance Utility).
3. Choose Advanced Options, and then press ENTER.
4. Set the EMS cache size to 0.
5. Set the Conventional cache size to 1 (the minimum).
6. Set Allow Write Caching to NO.
7. At the confirmation prompt, choose Yes. You will see a message 
   saying that you must restart your computer for the changes to take 
   effect.
8. Quit Volume Maintenance Utility, and then restart your computer.
9. Start Windows, and then run Setup again.


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 OVER WINDOWS NT 
=====================================

If you are multi-booting MS-DOS and Windows NT, boot to MS-DOS, and 
then run Setup from either MS-DOS or Windows 3.x. You will not be able 
to install Windows 95 to a directory with a shared Windows 3.x/Windows NT
configuration; you will need to install Windows 95 to a different
directory.

If you are not multi-booting MS-DOS and Windows NT, you should
configure your computer to multi-boot MS-DOS and Windows NT first, and
then follow the instructions above.

If you boot MS-DOS from a floppy disk and then run Setup, you will no
longer be able to boot Windows NT; however, you can restore Windows NT
by booting from the Windows NT boot/repair disk, and then selecting the
Repair option).


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 OVER OS/2
===============================

Setup will not run on OS/2. You need to boot to MS-DOS and run Setup 
from the MS-DOS prompt.

NOTE: If you are upgrading over OS/2 on an HPFS partition, you will
need to have your OS/2 disk 1 available during Setup.

If you are using OS/2 Boot Manager to choose operating systems at
startup, Setup will disable Boot Manager to ensure that Windows 95 can
restart the computer and complete its installation. Boot Manager can be
reactivated by running the Fdisk utility that comes with Windows 95
(see the procedure at the end of this section).

If you are not using Boot Manager, configure your computer to use Boot 
Manager, and then follow the instructions above.

If you boot MS-DOS from a floppy disk and then run Setup, you will no
longer be able to boot OS/2 after Windows 95 has been installed. You
will need to delete the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files that OS/2
uses before running Windows 95 Setup.

If you want to remove OS/2 from your computer after you have installed
Windows 95, carry out the following procedure:

1. Back up the data files you want to keep onto a floppy disk or 
   network drive.
2. Delete the files in each of your OS/2 directories and subdirectories,
   and then delete the OS/2 directories.
3. In the root directory, the following files are marked as hidden 
   system files and need to be deleted:

	Ea data.sf
	OS2ldr.msg
	OS2krnl
	OS2boot
	Wp data.sf

   In My Computer or Windows Explorer, make sure hidden files are 
   visible. To do this, click the View menu, click Options, and then 
   click Show All Files. Then delete the OS/2 files listed above.

   NOTE: If you have a version of OS/2 other than version 2.0, the 
   names of the OS/2 files on your hard disk may differ from those 
   listed above. Also, depending on which version of OS/2 you have, 
   in your root directory, you may see the following files, which you 
   can delete:

	OS2dump
	OS2ldr
	OS2logo
	OS2ver

4. Remember to empty the Recycle Bin to permanently remove the files 
   from your computer.

If Boot Manager is installed and you want to remove it, restart your 
computer, and then carry out the following procedure. (It is recommended 
that you print this file before restarting your computer.)

1. When you see the Boot Manager menu, choose to boot to MS-DOS, and 
   then run FDisk.
2. Choose to make the MS-DOS partition (C) your active partition.
3. Quit FDisk, and then restart your computer.

If you want to reinstate Boot Manager after you install Windows 95, 
carry out the following procedure:

1. On the Start menu, click Run, and then type FDISK.
2. Choose Option 2, Set Active Partition.
3. Enter the number of the Boot Manager Partition. This partition will 
   be the 1 MB non-MS-DOS partition usually placed at the top or bottom.
4. Quit FDisk, and then restart your computer as instructed.

You can now boot OS/2 at any time and change labels of partitions
in Boot Manager through the OS/2 FDisk program.


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 ON COMPUTERS WITH LANTASTIC
=================================================

If you are running the LANtastic server, you must disable it before
setting up Windows 95. To disable the LANtastic server, either remove
the Server.exe file from your Autoexec.bat file, or type the following
command:

	server /remove

If you are running LANtastic and have either mapped or shared your
startup drive (usually drive C), Setup will not be able to determine
which drive is your startup drive and will not be able to continue.

Before running Setup, you must disable the mapping or stop sharing your
startup drive.


SETUP ERROR MESSAGES
====================

This section lists specific messages that you may encounter during Setup
and provides information about what to do next.

SU-0010, SU-0012, SU-0015, SU-0016
----------------------------------
If you receive one of these messages during Setup, please see the 
sections about OS/2 and Windows NT earlier in this document.

SU-0011
-------
If your hard disk is password-protected, Setup will not be able to 
complete successfully. You must first remove the password protection. 
For more information, see the documentation that came with your computer.

SU-0013
-------
To set up Windows 95, your startup drive must be an MS-DOS boot partition.
If your startup drive is an HPFS or Windows NT file system, you must create
an MS-DOS boot partition before running Setup. For more information, on
creating an MS-DOS boot partition, see the documentation that came with
your computer.

If you have LANtastic networking or SuperStor compression, see those
sections earlier in this document for more information.

SU0167
------
If you have a directory named Desktop in your current Windows
directory, Setup will not be able to install Windows 95 into that
directory. Windows 95 creates a directory named Desktop and uses it
for system files. If you get this message during Setup, you should
rename or move your current Desktop directory. Then run Setup again.

Standard Mode Messages
----------------------
If you get any of the following error messages, you should remove
any memory managers (such as EMM386.exe, QEMM, or 386Max) from your
Config.sys file, and then run Setup again.

	Standard Mode: Invalid DPMI return.
	Standard Mode: Fault in MS-DOS Extender.
	Standard Mode: Bad Fault in MS-DOS Extender.
	Standard Mode: Unknown stack in fault dispatcher.
	Standard Mode: Stack Overflow.

NOTE: If you still have problems, try adding EMM386.EXE back into your
Config.sys file and exclude all ranges. For example,

	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe x=A000-FFFF

If you encounter these messages or random hangs during Setup, you may 
need to turn on double-buffering in SmartDrive. Several SCSI hard drives 
and some ESDI drives require double-buffering.

To turn on double buffering, add the following line to the beginning of
your Config.sys file:

	device=c:\windows\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer+

where "c:\windows" is the path to your Windows directory.

Cannot Read Setup (.cab) Files
------------------------------
If you have Multimedia Cloaking and are installing Windows 95 from
floppy disks, Setup may not run successfully. If you see messages about
Setup not being able to read .cab files, then you should follow these 
steps:

1. Remove the line referencing Cacheclk.exe from your Config.sys and
   Autoexec.bat files.
2. Restart your computer.
3. Run Setup again.

Setup Could Not Back Up Your System Files
-----------------------------------------
If you see an error message while Setup is saving your system files, 
there may not be enough disk space, particularly on compressed disks. 
You should free up space on the drive you are saving your system files 
on (the default drive is C) by removing unneeded files.

Cannot continue on this system configuration
--------------------------------------------
If you get a message saying "Setup cannot continue on this system
configuration," you may have an older, incompatible disk partition.
Before running Setup, you will need to back up your data and then
repartition your disk.


GENERAL SETUP NOTES
===================

This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may 
prevent Setup from installing Windows 95 successfully.

Sager NP8200 or Wedge Technologies 466/DX2
------------------------------------------
WARNING: If you install Windows 95 on a Sager NP8200 or Wedge Technologies
466/DX2 laptop computer, you will not be able to use your computer, even 
if you reinstall a previous version of Windows.

Plug and Play Network Cards and 16-Bit Real-Mode Drivers
--------------------------------------------------------
When you need to run the 16-bit real-mode driver for your NIC (which is
common if you use DLC or another real-mode protocol), your Plug and Play
card may appear not to function because the 16-bit NIC drivers load before 
Windows 95 has a chance to turn on Plug and Play cards. Also, some 16-bit 
NIC drivers do not recognize Plug and Play cards (most NE2000 Plug and
Play clones fall into this category).

To use your Plug and Play card with a 16-bit NIC driver, carry out the
following procedure:
1. Run the Softset utility that comes with your Plug and Play card,
   and set the card to non-Plug and Play mode.
2. Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel and then remove the net
   card.
3. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon in Control Panel and follow the
   instructions on your screen. Windows 95 will detect your network card.

If you change to a 32-bit protected-mode NIC driver in the future, you 
can rerun Softset to turn on Plug and Play mode for your card.

Intel EtherExpress 16 NICs and PCI Computers
--------------------------------------------
You may experience system hangs or initialization problems if you are
using an Intel EtherExpress 16 NIC in a PCI computer with some Diamond
Speed Star PCI video cards. The following are excerpts from Intel's
Customer Support Database. These problems are not related to Windows 95, 
and happen on a variety of operating system platforms. In general, if
you experience other problems with your EtherExpress 16 in a PCI computer,
please attempt to replace the card before reporting the problem to
Microsoft.

If you have one of these video cards, contact your vendor about getting
a new video BIOS update.

- Diamond Speed Star PCI video card with BIOS version 1.01
- Diamond Viper PCI VGA Video Adapter
- Diamond Stealth video card, Bios v1.03

IBM Thinkpad Model 750x/755x/360x
---------------------------------
If you have one of these models, (including submodels such as C, CE, CX, 
CS, and CSE), check IBM's bulletin board or the THINKPAD forum on 
CompuServe for an updated BIOS and/or Mwave drivers for your computer 
before you install Windows 95.

If you don't upgrade your BIOS, you might have problems if you move the 
mouse while your computer is turning suspend mode on or off.


MEMORY MANAGERS
===============

If you have QEMM installed on your computer, we recommend removing it 
from your Config.sys file before setting up Windows 95. You can add it 
back after Windows 95 is installed.

The following memory managers are incompatible with or may cause
problems with Windows 95. It is recommended that you remove all
references to them from your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files and use
Emm386.exe and Himem.sys, which are provided with Windows 95, to manage
memory instead.

        Allemm4.sys - All Charge 386 Version 3.1
        HPemm386.sys and HPemm486.sys
        HPmm.sys - HP Memory Manager (must remove before Setup)
        Iemm.sys Memory Manager
        Intel(R) Expanded-Memory Emulator (Ilim386.sys)
        Maximizer Memory Manager (Maximize.com)
        NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.sys)
	QMAPS Memory Manager Version 5.16
	UMB PRO Version 1.07

NOTE: The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Setup will fail.

NOTE: If you remove the line containing Rm386.sys from your Config.sys
file, you may need to install Himem.sys, which comes with Windows or
MS-DOS. You can do this by adding the following line to your Config.sys
file:

        device=<path>\himem.sys                                       

The <path> is the location of your Windows or MS-DOS files (for example,
C:\Windows).


DISK-CACHE PROGRAMS
===================

Before you run Setup, it is recommended that you remove any third-
party disk-cache programs and replace them with Smartdrv.exe, which 
is provided with Windows 95.

While running Windows 95, you do not need to use a disk-cache utility. 
Setup will remove most disk-cache programs for you.

If you are running one of the following disk-cache utilities, you
should remove it. In some cases, Setup will remove it for you.

  386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (Qcache.exe) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Cache.exe Disk-Cache Utility
  Cache.sys Disk-Cache Utility
  Flash Disk-Cache Utility (Flash.exe) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Icache.sys Disk-Cache Utility 
  IBMcache.sys Disk-Cache Utility 
  Mace Disk-Cache Utility (Mcache.sys)
  Norton Speed Drive Disk Utility (SPEEDRV)
  Norton Utilities Version 5.0 and 6.1 (DISKREET, NCACHE)
  PC-Cache (PC Tools disk cache program) (must remove before Setup)
  PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (Pc-kwik.exe)
  PC_Kwik Disk Accelerator
  PC-Kwik Version 1.59 (Pck.exe, Pskscrn.exe, Pckey.com)
  PC Tools(TM) Disk-Cache Utility (Pc-cache.com)
  Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (Fast512.sys) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (Superpck.exe)


ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
===================

Some anti-virus programs can cause problems when you run Setup. Make
sure that no anti-virus programs are running while you are setting up
Windows 95. If the program is a terminate-and-stay-resident program,
remove any references to it in your Autoexec.bat, Config.sys, and Win.ini
files.

If your BIOS has built-in virus protection, you should disable it before
running Setup. To disable it, you must use the CMOS setup program for
your BIOS. For more information, see the documentation that came with
your computer.

See the notes for specific anti-virus programs below.

Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (Vsafe.com/Vsafe.sys)
----------------------------------------------------------
To remove VSAFE, remove any lines containing Vsafe.com or Vsafe.sys
from your Autoexec.bat file. Also, remove any references to Vsafe.com
or Vsafe.sys from the RUN= line in your Win.ini file.

If you are upgrading to Windows 95, you must also delete all the
Chklist.ms files that VSAFE has created before you run Setup. Because
Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off the
Vsafe write-protection option when you run Windows 95.

If you don't remove VSAFE before you set up Windows, you will see
warnings about Command.com, Win.com, and Krnl.386 when Windows starts.
If you see these warnings, ignore them and choose the update option.
For more information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.

F-PROT Professional
-------------------
Setup cannot run if F-PROT Professional is running. Remove this program
from your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files, and then check your Win.ini
file for the following line:

	load=wvirstop.exe

If you see this line, remove it. When you have finished, restart your
computer, and then run Setup again.

Norton Anti-Virus(R) 
---------------------
If you are running any version of Norton Anti-Virus, you should remove it 
before running Setup. After setup, it is recommended that you do not run
Norton Anti-Virus version 1.x, 2.x, or 3.x with Windows 95. You should
obtain Norton Anti-Virus for Windows 95.

To remove Norton Anti-Virus version 1.5:

1. In your Config.sys file, remove the following line:

	device=c:\nav\nav_.sys

2. In your Autoexec.bat file, remove C:\Nav from the PATH statement.

To remove the anti-virus features of Norton Desktop for Windows
version 3.0:

1. In your Config.sys file, remove the following line:

	device=c:\ndw\navtsr.exe

2. In your Autoexec.bat file, remove the following lines:

	c:\ndw\image.exe
	c:\ndw from the PATH statement

3. In your System.ini file, remove the following lines:

	shell=c:\ndw\ndw.exe (in the [boot] section)
	device=symevent (in the [386enh] section)

4. In your Win.ini file, remove the following line:

	load=c:\ndw\navtsrw.exe


USING TERMINATE-AND-STAY-RESIDENT (TSR) PROGRAMS AND DRIVERS
============================================================

APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 95. It prevents Windows
and Windows-based programs from creating valid Well-Formed-Path (WFP)
names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting
from the root directory.)

Autocon Version 2.0e, Bootcon Version 1.60, and Boot.sys
--------------------------------------------------------
These programs enable you to select from different configurations when
you start your computer. Windows 95 Setup modifies only the first
section in your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, so you may have to
modify these files manually after Setup if you want to use these
programs. For more information, see the documentation that came with
your program.

Cubit Version 3.01
------------------
When you are using Cubit with Windows 95, do not compress the Windows
System directory or any file that is loaded from your Config.sys file.

Before you upgrade to Windows 95, make sure that the earlier version of
Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the files
after you have successfully set up Windows 95.

Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------
Windows 95 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use it with
Doubledisk. Phantom drives occur when you use Doubledisk to create a
compressed drive. For example, if you have drives A, B, and C on your
computer and you use Doubledisk to create drive F, Windows 95 and
MS-DOS recognize drives D and E as valid drives, even though they do
not actually exist. You can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows
from recognizing phantom drives. To order a copy of
the DRVOFF utility, contact Vertisoft.

Infinite Disk Version 2.1
-------------------------
Infinite Disk version 2.1 does not work properly with Windows 95.
Either remove Infinite Disk software from your computer before you run
Setup, or contact your software dealer for a version of Infinite Disk
software that is compatible with Windows 95.

To remove Infinite Disk from your computer:
1. Restore any compressed files back to their original state.
2. Remove the following lines from your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat 
   files:

	iddrv.sys
	idres.exe
	protect /c

3. Restart your computer, and then run Setup again.
 
NetWare(R) NetBIOS
------------------
The NetWare NetBIOS TSR is incompatible with Windows 95 in many
configurations. In most cases, Setup will detect NetWare NetBIOS and
remove the startup command from your computer. However, if you have
NetWare NetBIOS set up to start from a location other than your
Autoexec.bat file (for example, from a batch file), Setup cannot
detect it. In this case, you need to remove NetWare NetBIOS manually.
Windows 95 includes an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol that you can use
instead of NetBIOS. For information about configuring Windows 95 to
work with it, see NETWORKS.TXT.

Newspace Version 1.07
---------------------
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows 95.

Norton Desktop for Windows (Ep.exe)
-----------------------------------
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (Ep.exe) is loaded from
your Autoexec.bat file, you need to disable it when you are setting up
Windows, especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of
Windows. Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files, which
can cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup.

It is recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap file. 
If you are using a temporary swap file, you need to exclude files that
have a .tmp or .swp extension from erase protection.

Norton Disklock Versions 3.01 and 3.5
-------------------------------------
Norton Disklock versions 3.01 and 3.5 do not work properly with
Windows 95. Either remove this software from your computer before you
run Setup, or contact Symantec product support for a version of
Disklock that is compatible with Windows 95.

For information about how to remove Disklock from your computer, see
the documentation that came with Norton Disklock.

PC Tools Deluxe(TM) Version 7.1 (DATAMON)
-----------------------------------------
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option, Setup may fail
if you are low on disk space. Do not use the \SENTRY+ option when loading
DATAMON.

Do not load DATAMON after loading SmartDrive. If DATAMON is loaded after
SmartDrive, your computer may fail. See the PC Tools documentation for
information about how to unload DATAMON.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)
-------------------------------------
If you try to start PC Tools from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows,
your computer may fail or restart itself. These problems also occur if
you use MS-DOS commands from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.

Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems. However, do not load
DESKTOP from an MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded before starting Windows. 
If you do, your computer may fail when you quit Windows. It is recommended
that you run DESKTOP from its PIF, provided with Windows 95.

SUBST (MS-DOS)
--------------
You may encounter problems with SUBST during Setup, but you can safely
add it back after Windows 95 has been installed.

UNDELETE
--------
If you are running UNDELETE with the SENTRY option, Setup may have
problems, and there may be cases when you run out of disk space during
Setup. It is recommended that you remove UNDELETE from your Config.sys
and Autoexec.bat files before running Setup.

NOTE: The SENTRY option creates a hidden directory named Sentry. When
you delete a file, UNDELETE moves the file from its current location to 
the Sentry directory. Before removing UNDELETE from your Config.sys or
Autoexec.bat file, you should free up disk space by using the
UNDELETE /PURGE command on all drives.)

If you do not remove it, Setup will disable this command for you.


KNOWN POTENTIAL SETUP PROBLEMS
==============================

Installing Windows 95 on a 4 MB or 386 computer from floppy disks may
be very slow. To speed things up:

- Run Setup from inside Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups. Avoid
  running Setup from MS-DOS.

- If you are running a disk-compression program, such as DriveSpace or
  DoubleSpace, Setup may be very slow. Consider copying the files on 
  the floppy disks to a temporary directory on your hard disk, and then
  running Setup from your hard disk. To copy files from Disks 2 through
  12, you will need to use the EXTRACT command on Disk 1 to copy the 
  Win95_xx.cab files to your hard disk, since they are in the new
  Microsoft Distribution Media Format (DMF). Normal MS-DOS commands like 
  COPY and XCOPY won't work on these floppy disks.
  
  To copy a .cab file from a floppy disk to your hard disk, use the
  following command:

	extract /c a:win95_xx.cab c:\<TempDir>

  where <TempDir> is the location of a temporary directory on your
  hard disk.

- During Setup, if you notice that the light for an empty floppy disk 
  drive is flashing for a long time and Setup is slow, try inserting a 
  formatted floppy disk into the empty drive.

- If you encounter problems during Setup, such as Setup closing 
  unexpectedly or error messages that do not apply, try increasing the 
  size of your permanent swap file. In general, the size of your 
  permanent swap file plus the amount of RAM in your computer should 
  equal at least 14 MB for Setup to complete successfully. After you 
  change your swap file size, try running Setup again.

  NOTE: If your hard disk is compressed, you may have to increase the 
  size of your host drive before you can increase the size of your
  swap file.

OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT (AS DEFINED
BELOW), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY
OR USE THE PRODUCT.

MICROSOFT LICENSE AND NON-DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT FOR PRE-RELEASE CODE for the
Microsoft Product code-named "Whistler" 

 1. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR DUAL DISTRIBUTION. 

    (a) Microsoft may provide the software accompanying this
    Agreement (the "Product") as a web-based download or on a
    CD-ROM.  Microsoft grants Recipient a limited, non
    -exclusive, nontransferable, non-assignable, royalty-free
    license to install and use copies of the Product on up to
    one (1) computers residing on Recipient's premises,
    solely for Recipient's internal testing.  The foregoing
    limit is aggregate and applies regardless of how many
    copies of the Product Recipient obtains from Microsoft. 
    If Recipient is downloading the Product from a Microsoft
    web site, Recipient may make one (1) additional copy of
    the Product onto a CD-ROM to exercise the rights granted
    above.  All other rights are reserved to Microsoft. 
    Recipient shall not rent, lease, sell, sublicense,
    assign, or otherwise transfer the Product or any
    accompanying printed materials ("Documentation"). 
    Recipient may not reverse engineer or decompile the
    Product, except to the extent that local law expressly
    prohibits the foregoing restriction.  Recipient may not
    use the Product in a live operating environment where it
    may be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a
    commercially released product or with data that has not
    been sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
    Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
    and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
    rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
    construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
    ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
    information therein, except as specifically stated
    herein.

    (b) Mandatory Activation. The license rights granted under
    this EULA may be limited to the first fourteen (14) days
    after Recipient first boots the Software Product unless
    Recipient activates Recipient's copy of the Software
    Product in the manner described during the setup sequence
    of the Software Product and, as a result of such
    activation, Recipient receives a final confirmation
    number for the Software Product.  Any use of the Software
    Product after the fourteenth (14th) day will require
    Recipient's input of such confirmation number.  

    (c) RECIPIENT'S RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT
    SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE
    RECIPIENT FIRST INSTALLS ANY PORTION
    OF THE PRODUCT ON ANY DEVICE FOR A
    PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180)
    DAYS. THE PRODUCT IS TIME SENSITIVE
    AND WILL NOT FUNCTION UPON EXPIRATION
    OF THE 180 DAY PERIOD. NOTICE OF
    EXPIRATION WILL NOT ACTIVELY BE
    GIVEN, SO RECIPIENT NEEDS TO PLAN FOR
    THE EXPIRATION DATE AND MAKE A COPY
    OF AND REMOVE RECIPIENT'S IMPORTANT
    DATA BEFORE EXPIRATION. If Recipient
    desires to use the Product after evaluation is completed,
    Recipient will need to acquire a validly licensed copy of
    the non-evaluation version of the Product.

    (d) At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
    reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not
    limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with
    respect to the testing of the Product.  In addition, if
    requested by Microsoft, Recipient will use reasonable
    efforts to review and comment on all documentation
    supplied.  All bug reports, test results and other
    feedback made by Recipient shall be the property of
    Microsoft and may be used by Microsoft for any purpose it
    sees fit.  Due to the nature of the development work,
    Microsoft is not certain if errors or discrepancies in
    the Product may be corrected.

    (e) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
    Recipient's site. Recipient may not demonstrate or show
    the Product to third parties without the express written
    permission of Microsoft.

    (f) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
    accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
    Services, or application-sharing functionality may
    require additional licenses - please consult the license
    agreement accompanying such software.

 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall commence
    upon Recipient's copying, installing or using the Product
    and shall continue unless terminated by Microsoft in
    writing at any time, with or without cause.  This
    Agreement will terminate without notice upon the
    commercial release of the Product.  Upon the termination
    of this Agreement, Recipient shall cease use of the
    Product and, upon request, shall promptly return to
    Microsoft, or certify destruction of, all full or partial
    copies of the Product and related materials provided by

    by the Microsoft policies and programs described in
    "online" documentation, and/or in other Microsoft-provided

    and conditions of this Agreement. With respect to
    technical information Recipient provides to Microsoft as
    part of the Support Services, Microsoft may use such
    information for its business purposes, including for
    product support and development. Microsoft will not
    utilize such technical information in a form that
    personally identifies Recipient.  Such limited Support
    Services may not be available in all countries outside
    the United States and will be discontinued once the
    Product is commercially released.

 4. MAINTENANCE.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide
    maintenance, technical support, or updates to Recipient
    for Product licensed under this Agreement.  In no event
    shall Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient, free
    of charge, a copy of the commercial release version of
    the Product in connection with Recipient's participation
    in the testing program.  Microsoft is not obligated to
    make the Product commercially available.  

 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  To the maximum
    extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and its
    suppliers provide to Recipient the Product and Support
    Services AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS;
    and Microsoft and its suppliers hereby disclaim with

    DESCRIPTION OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  THE
    ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT AND ANY
    SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS WITH
    RECIPIENT.

    AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE

    the "Server") where the Server machines meet or exceed
    the following minimum requirements, for either 32-bit or
    64-bit processor architectures: capable of expansion to

    residing on Recipient's premises and connected to a
    Server.  The foregoing server software component limit is
    aggregate and applies regardless of how many copies of
    the Product Recipient obtains from Microsoft.  If

    Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
    nontransferable, royalty-free license to:  (i) install

    of copies of the client software components of the
    Product (including any profiles created using the
    Product), on client computers residing on Recipient's
    premises and connected to a Server.  The foregoing server
    software component limit is aggregate and applies

    Product from a Microsoft web site, Recipient may make one
    (1) additional copy of the Product onto a CD-ROM to
    exercise the rights granted above.  All other rights are
    reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall not rent, lease,
    sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the
    Product or any accompanying printed materials

    or decompile the Product, except to the extent that 
    local law expressly prohibits the foregoing 
    restriction.  Recipient may not use the Product
    in a live operating environment where it may be relied
    upon to perform in the same manner as a commercially

    number for the Software Product.  Any use of the Software

    sees fit.  Due to the nature of the development work,
    Microsoft is not certain if errors or discrepancies in
    the Product may be corrected.

    (e) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
    Recipient's site.  Recipient may not demonstrate or show

MICROSOFT LICENSE AND NON-DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT FOR PRE-RELEASE CODE 
for the Microsoft Product code-named "Whistler" 
 
 1. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR DUAL DISTRIBUTION.  

    (a) Microsoft may provide the software accompanying this
    Agreement (the "Product") as a web-based download or on a
    CD-ROM.  Solely for internal testing, Microsoft grants
    Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
    nontransferable, royalty-free license to:  (i) install
    and use one (1) copy of the server software component of
    the Product on a computer residing on Recipient's
    premises (a computer running the server software
    component of the Product shall be referred to as the
    "Server"), and (ii) install and use an unlimited number
    of copies of the client software components of the
    Product (including any profiles created using the
    Product), on client computers residing on Recipient's
    premises and connected to a Server.  The foregoing server
    software component limit is aggregate and applies
    regardless of how many copies of the Product Recipient
    obtains from Microsoft.  If Recipient is downloading the
    Product from a Microsoft web site, Recipient may make one
    (1) additional copy of the Product onto a CD-ROM to
    exercise the rights granted above.  All other rights are
    reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall not rent, lease,
    sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the
    Product or any accompanying printed materials 
    ("Documentation").  Recipient may not reverse engineer 
    or decompile the Product, except to the extent that 
    local law expressly prohibits the foregoing 
    restriction.  Recipient may not use the Product
    in a live operating environment where it may be relied
    upon to perform in the same manner as a commercially
    released product or with data that has not been
    sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
    Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
    and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
    rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
    construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
    ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
    information therein, except as specifically stated
    herein.

    (b) Mandatory Activation. The license rights granted under
    this EULA may be limited to the first fourteen (14) days
    after Recipient first boots the Software Product unless
    Recipient activates Recipient's copy of the Software
    Product in the manner described during the setup sequence
    of the Software Product and, as a result of such
    activation, Recipient  receives a final confirmation
    number for the Software Product.  Any use of the Software
    Product after the fourteenth (14th) day will require
    Recipient's input of such confirmation number.  

    (c) YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT SHALL
    BE EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST
    INSTALL ANY PORTION OF THE PRODUCT ON
    ANY DEVICE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE
    HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAYS. THE
    PRODUCT IS TIME SENSITIVE AND WILL
    NOT FUNCTION UPON EXPIRATION OF THE
    180 DAY PERIOD. NOTICE OF EXPIRATION
    WILL NOT ACTIVELY BE GIVEN, SO YOU
    NEED TO PLAN FOR THE EXPIRATION DATE
    AND MAKE A COPY OF AND REMOVE YOUR
    IMPORTANT DATA BEFORE EXPIRATION. If
    you desire to use the Product after your evaluation is
    completed, you will need to acquire a validly licensed
    copy of the non-evaluation version of the Product.

    (d) At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
    reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not
    limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with
    respect to the Product testing.  In addition, if
    requested by Microsoft, Recipient will use reasonable
    efforts to review and comment on all documentation
    supplied.  All bug reports, test results and other
    feedback made by Recipient shall be the property of
    Microsoft and may be used by Microsoft for any purpose it
    sees fit.  Due to the nature of the development work,
    Microsoft is not certain if errors or discrepancies in
    the Product may be corrected.

    (e) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
    Recipient's site.  Recipient may not demonstrate or show
    the Product to third parties without the express written
    permission of Microsoft.

    (f) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
    accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
    Services, or application-sharing functionality may
    require additional licenses - please consult the license
    agreement accompanying such software.
 
 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall commence
    upon Recipient's copying, installing or using the Product
    and shall continue unless terminated by Microsoft in
    writing at any time, with or without cause.  This
    Agreement will terminate without notice upon the
    commercial release of the Product.  Upon the termination
    of this Agreement, Recipient shall cease use of the
    Product and, shall, upon request, promptly return to
    Microsoft, or certify destruction of, all full or partial
    copies of the Product and related materials provided by

    materials.  Any supplemental software code provided to
    Recipient as part of the Support Services shall be
    considered part of the Product and subject to the terms
    and conditions of this Agreement.  With respect to
    technical information Recipient provides to Microsoft as
    part of the Support Services, Microsoft may use such
    information for its business purposes, including for
    product support and development.  Microsoft will not
    utilize such technical information in a form that
    personally identifies Recipient.  Such limited Support
    Services may not be available in all countries outside
    the United States and will be discontinued once the
    Product is commercially released.
 
 4. MAINTENANCE.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide
    maintenance, technical support, or updates to Recipient
    for Product licensed under this Agreement.  In no event
    shall Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient, free

    the Product in connection with Recipient's participation
    in the testing program.  Microsoft is not obligated to
    make the Product commercially available.
 
 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  To the maximum
    extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and its
    suppliers provide to Recipient the Product and Support
    Services AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS;

    PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT AND ANY
    SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS WITH
    RECIPIENT.
 
 6. EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
    AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE

Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft and 
its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership rights to 
the Product, and this EULA shall not be construed in any 
manner as transferring any rights of ownership or license to

* You agree to provide to Microsoft reasonable suggestions,
comments and feedback regarding the Product, including but not
limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with

product, technology or service. Further, you warrant that your 
Feedback is not subject to license terms that will require, or

6. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights,
  Microsoft may cancel this EULA if you do not abide by the

  parts.

7. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND
  LIMITATIONS.  

* NetMeeting/Remote Assistance/Remote Desktop Features.  The
Product contains NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote
Desktop technologies that enable the Product or other
applications installed on the Workstation Computer to be used
remotely between two or more computers, even if the Product or
application is installed on only one Workstation Computer. 
You may use NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop
with all Microsoft products; provided however, use of these
technologies with certain Microsoft products may require an
additional license.  For Microsoft and non-Microsoft products,
you should consult the license agreement accompanying the
applicable product or contact the applicable licensor to
determine whether use of NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, or
Remote Desktop is permitted without an additional license.

* Consent to Use of Data.  You agree that Microsoft and its
affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered
in any manner as part of the product support services provided
to you, if any, related to the Product.  Microsoft may use
this information solely to improve our products or to provide
customized services or technologies to you.  Microsoft may
disclose this information to others, but not in a form that
personally identifies you.   

* Internet Gaming/Update Features.  If you choose to utilize
the Internet gaming or update features within the Product, it
is necessary to use certain computer system, hardware, and
software information to implement the features.   By using
these features, you explicitly authorize Microsoft or its
designated agent to access and utilize the necessary
information for Internet gaming and/or updating purposes.  
Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our
products or to provide customized services or technologies to
you.  Microsoft may disclose this information to others, but
not in a form that personally identifies you.     

* Internet-Based Services Components.  The Product contains
components that enable and facilitate the use of
certain Internet-based services.  You acknowledge and agree
that Microsoft may automatically check the version of the
Product and/or its components that you are utilizing and may
provide upgrades or fixes to the Product that will be
automatically downloaded to your Workstation Computer.  

* Security Updates.  Content providers are using the digital
rights management technology ("Microsoft DRM") contained in
this Product to protect the integrity of their content (
"Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. 
Owners of such Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may,
from time to time, request Microsoft to provide security
related updates to the Microsoft DRM components of the Product
("Security Updates") that may affect your ability to copy,
display and/or play Secure Content through Microsoft software
or third party applications that utilize Microsoft DRM.  You
therefore agree that, if you elect to download a license from
the Internet which enables your use of Secure Content,
Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download
onto your computer such Security Updates that a Secure Content
Owner has requested that Microsoft distribute.  Microsoft will
not retrieve any personally identifiable information, or any

The OS Components are provided to update, supplement,

Software").  An amendment or addendum to this
Supplemental EULA may accompany the OS Components.

   any additional end user license agreement that may

   such terms and conditions.  To the extent that there is
   a conflict among any of these terms and conditions
   applicable to the OS Components, the following hierarchy

   Individual EULA; 2) the terms and conditions in this

July 22, 1996 Release (IPFCS1RC3)
=================================
o moved cst_lbc.h into acm archive

o modified g723.c so that SID modes are disabled.  This way broken
  applications (e.g., SoundRecorder) aren't affected.

July 18, 1996 Beta Release
==========================

o Added 11025 Hz PCM format capabilities.

o Integrated Mike Keith's 8000-to-11000 Hz and 11000-to-8000 Hz
  sample rate conversion routines.

o Added code to acmdStreamConvert() (in g723.c ) to fudge from
  11000 Hz to 11025 Hz sampling rate and vice versa.

o Made 11025 Hz the default format since it is the more widely
  supported by PC hardware and since this prevents certain
  applications from using low quality sample rate converters and
  introducing unnecessary distortion (see CAVEATS below).

o Made changes in acmdStreamConvert() so that speech and silence
  frames can both be encoded from the same driver buffer.  This
  ensures that applications using large driver buffer sizes will
  still benefit from silence detection.

o Corrected the name of the speech coding algorithm in g723.rc.
  The name of the algorithm is "G.723.1" and not "G.723".

o Microsoft's "Sound Recorder" application that comes with Win95
  has some problems that are exposed by the G.723.1 ACM driver.
  Sound Recorder always uses the default ACM driver format.
  Therefore, when asked to encode 8 KHz PCM using G.723.1,
  it first upsamples the data to 11025 KHz using a low quality
  sample rate converter (thereby introducing unnecessary distortion).

o Microsoft's "Sound Recorder" and "ACMAPP" applications both
  apparently ignore the cbSrcLengthUsed field of the
  LPACMDRVSTREAMHEADER structure.  Consequently, the unused portion
  of a buffer of G.723.1 data is discarded instead of being moved to
  the start of the next driver buffer.  The result is that subsequent
  frames of G.723.1 data are misaligned and are not properly decoded.

  ANY APPLICATION THAT IGNORES THE cbSrcLengthUsed FIELD IN THIS WAY
  WILL FAIL RESULTING IN GARBLED AUDIO!!!

o As a result of the above problem the G.723.1 formats that use
  silence detection have not been fully tested in this release.

to do

1. decide on wave format for l and h codecs. one wave format tag with 
sub-tags in the extra bytes or use four tags? 

2. add code throughout wrapper to handle four codecs instead of one

3. determine block size and other constants for each codec

4. write conversion routine using l and h api

5. run-time dynamically link to the codec or just load all four always

1. Executive Summary

   This document describes the MD5 message-digest algorithm. The
   algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
   as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
   It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce
   two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any
   message having a given prespecified target message digest. The MD5
   algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a
   large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being
   encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem
   such as RSA.

RFC 1321              MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm            April 1992


   The MD5 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines. In
   addition, the MD5 algorithm does not require any large substitution
   tables; the algorithm can be coded quite compactly.

   The MD5 algorithm is an extension of the MD4 message-digest algorithm
   1,2]. MD5 is slightly slower than MD4, but is more "conservative" in
   design. MD5 was designed because it was felt that MD4 was perhaps
   being adopted for use more quickly than justified by the existing
   critical review; because MD4 was designed to be exceptionally fast,
   it is "at the edge" in terms of risking successful cryptanalytic
   attack. MD5 backs off a bit, giving up a little in speed for a much
   greater likelihood of ultimate security. It incorporates some
   suggestions made by various reviewers, and contains additional
   optimizations. The MD5 algorithm is being placed in the public domain
   for review and possible adoption as a standard.

   For OSI-based applications, MD5's object identifier is

   md5 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
     iso(1) member-body(2) US(840) rsadsi(113549) digestAlgorithm(2) 5}

   In the X.509 type AlgorithmIdentifier [3], the parameters for MD5
   should have type NULL.

2. Terminology and Notation

   In this document a "word" is a 32-bit quantity and a "byte" is an
   eight-bit quantity. A sequence of bits can be interpreted in a
   natural manner as a sequence of bytes, where each consecutive group
   of eight bits is interpreted as a byte with the high-order (most
   significant) bit of each byte listed first. Similarly, a sequence of
   bytes can be interpreted as a sequence of 32-bit words, where each
   consecutive group of four bytes is interpreted as a word with the
   low-order (least significant) byte given first.

   Let x_i denote "x sub i". If the subscript is an expression, we
   surround it in braces, as in x_{i+1}. Similarly, we use ^ for
   superscripts (exponentiation), so that x^i denotes x to the i-th
   power.

   Let the symbol "+" denote addition of words (i.e., modulo-2^32
   addition). Let X <<< s denote the 32-bit value obtained by circularly
   shifting (rotating) X left by s bit positions. Let not(X) denote the
   bit-wise complement of X, and let X v Y denote the bit-wise OR of X
   and Y. Let X xor Y denote the bit-wise XOR of X and Y, and let XY
   denote the bit-wise AND of X and Y.

3. MD5 Algorithm Description

   We begin by supposing that we have a b-bit message as input, and that
   we wish to find its message digest. Here b is an arbitrary
   nonnegative integer; b may be zero, it need not be a multiple of
   eight, and it may be arbitrarily large. We imagine the bits of the
   message written down as follows:

          m_0 m_1 ... m_{b-1}

   The following five steps are performed to compute the message digest
   of the message.

3.1 Step 1. Append Padding Bits

   The message is "padded" (extended) so that its length (in bits) is
   congruent to 448, modulo 512. That is, the message is extended so
   that it is just 64 bits shy of being a multiple of 512 bits long.
   Padding is always performed, even if the length of the message is
   already congruent to 448, modulo 512.

   Padding is performed as follows: a single "1" bit is appended to the
   message, and then "0" bits are appended so that the length in bits of
   the padded message becomes congruent to 448, modulo 512. In all, at
   least one bit and at most 512 bits are appended.

3.2 Step 2. Append Length

   A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before the
   padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the previous
   step. In the unlikely event that b is greater than 2^64, then only
   the low-order 64 bits of b are used. (These bits are appended as two
   32-bit words and appended low-order word first in accordance with the
   previous conventions.)

   At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits and with
   b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits. Equivalently,
   this message has a length that is an exact multiple of 16 (32-bit)
   words. Let M[0 ... N-1] denote the words of the resulting message,
   where N is a multiple of 16.

3.3 Step 3. Initialize MD Buffer

   A four-word buffer (A,B,C,D) is used to compute the message digest.
   Here each of A, B, C, D is a 32-bit register. These registers are
   initialized to the following values in hexadecimal, low-order bytes
   first):

          word A: 01 23 45 67
          word B: 89 ab cd ef
          word C: fe dc ba 98
          word D: 76 54 32 10

3.4 Step 4. Process Message in 16-Word Blocks

   We first define four auxiliary functions that each take as input
   three 32-bit words and produce as output one 32-bit word.

          F(X,Y,Z) = XY v not(X) Z
          G(X,Y,Z) = XZ v Y not(Z)
          H(X,Y,Z) = X xor Y xor Z
          I(X,Y,Z) = Y xor (X v not(Z))

   In each bit position F acts as a conditional: if X then Y else Z.
   The function F could have been defined using + instead of v since XY
   and not(X)Z will never have 1's in the same bit position.) It is
   interesting to note that if the bits of X, Y, and Z are independent
   and unbiased, the each bit of F(X,Y,Z) will be independent and
   unbiased.

   The functions G, H, and I are similar to the function F, in that they
   act in "bitwise parallel" to produce their output from the bits of X,
   Y, and Z, in such a manner that if the corresponding bits of X, Y,
   and Z are independent and unbiased, then each bit of G(X,Y,Z),
   H(X,Y,Z), and I(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased. Note that
   the function H is the bit-wise "xor" or "parity" function of its
   inputs.

   This step uses a 64-element table T[1 ... 64] constructed from the
   sine function. Let T[i] denote the i-th element of the table, which
   is equal to the integer part of 4294967296 times abs(sin(i)), where i
   is in radians. The elements of the table are given in the appendix.

   Do the following:

   /* Process each 16-word block. */
   For i = 0 to N/16-1 do

     /* Copy block i into X. */
     For j = 0 to 15 do
       Set X[j] to M[i*16+j].
     end /* of loop on j */

     /* Save A as AA, B as BB, C as CC, and D as DD. */
     AA = A
     BB = B

3.5 Step 5. Output

   The message digest produced as output is A, B, C, D. That is, we
   begin with the low-order byte of A, and end with the high-order byte
   of D.

   This completes the description of MD5. A reference implementation in
   C is given in the appendix.

4. Summary

   The MD5 message-digest algorithm is simple to implement, and provides
   a "fingerprint" or message digest of a message of arbitrary length.
   It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
   having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
   and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
   message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations. The MD5 algorithm
   has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses. It is, however, a
   relatively new algorithm and further security analysis is of course
   justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this sort.

5. Differences Between MD4 and MD5

     The following are the differences between MD4 and MD5:

       1.   A fourth round has been added.

       2.   Each step now has a unique additive constant.

       3.   The function g in round 2 was changed from (XY v XZ v YZ) to
       (XZ v Y not(Z)) to make g less symmetric.

       4.   Each step now adds in the result of the previous step.  This
       promotes a faster "avalanche effect".

       5.   The order in which input words are accessed in rounds 2 and
       3 is changed, to make these patterns less like each other.

       6.   The shift amounts in each round have been approximately
       optimized, to yield a faster "avalanche effect." The shifts in
       different rounds are distinct.

APPENDIX A - Reference Implementation

   This appendix contains the following files taken from RSAREF: A
   Cryptographic Toolkit for Privacy-Enhanced Mail:

     global.h -- global header file

     md5.h -- header file for MD5

     md5c.c -- source code for MD5

   For more information on RSAREF, send email to <rsaref@rsa.com>.

   The appendix also includes the following file:

     mddriver.c -- test driver for MD2, MD4 and MD5

   The driver compiles for MD5 by default but can compile for MD2 or MD4
   if the symbol MD is defined on the C compiler command line as 2 or 4.

   The implementation is portable and should work on many different
   plaforms. However, it is not difficult to optimize the implementation
   on particular platforms, an exercise left to the reader. For example,
   on "little-endian" platforms where the lowest-addressed byte in a 32-
   bit word is the least significant and there are no alignment
   restrictions, the call to Decode in MD5Transform can be replaced with
   a typecast.

Security Considerations

   The level of security discussed in this memo is considered to be
   sufficient for implementing very high security hybrid digital-
   signature schemes based on MD5 and a public-key cryptosystem.

NMRK- NetMeeting Resource Kit wizard										  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
author: ryanha																  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------
Overview:
----------
NetMeeting can be configured via the registry.  There are several registry
keys that can be tweaked. Because of the fact that tweaking the registry is 
error-prone by nature, we do not support users directly tweaking the registry.
With prior releases of the NetMeeting Resource kit, the appropriate registry 
keys and values could be tweaked via the Policy Editor, and .POL files.  This
was not an effective solution for all of our customers, because many of them
did not use the policy functionality for a variety of reasons.  The NMRK 
wizard is the solution to this problem.  A user is able to create a custom
distributable file of NetMeeting that has the selected properties enabled
based on the information gathered in the Wizard. In short, the user enters 
information in a series of dialogs, and the wizard creates a file called
nm21c.exe.  This is a custom distributable that the users can use for 
deployment in their corporation.


---------------
Implementation
---------------

1.) Gather information from the user through a series of dialogs
2.) Find the nm21.exe original distributable
3.) Clean up our stuff from the temp directory in case we terminated
	abnormally in a previous run
4.) Create the directory %TEMP%\nmrktmp
5.) Extract the old distributable to the %TEMP%\nmrktmp directory
6.) Find the MsNetMtg.inf file in the %TEMP%\nmrktmp directory
7.) Alter the MsNetMtg.inf file to contian the new registry settings
		based on the information gathered from the wizard dialogs
8.) Copy the nm21.exe file to the output directory with the new filename, 
		this defaults to:

		<nmrk root>\output\nm21c.exe

9.) Use updfile.exe ( from <nmrk root>\tools\ ) to add the new inf file
		to the <nmrk root>\output\nm21c.exe file.
10.) Delete the files that we created in the %TEMP%\nmrktmp directory
11.) Delete the directory %TEMP%\nmrktmp
12.) MessageBox to the user that we have successfully created the custom
		distributable file.

There are some keys in section [NetMtg.Install.DeleteReg.NMRK] that may
also be in an AddReg section elsewhere in the .inf file. In section 
[NetMtg.Install.Reg.PerUser], the keys that start with
	HKCU,\"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory\",\"Name"
and	HKCU,\"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory\",\"Count"

must all be deleted because we add them based on information from the 
NMRK wizard.  The keys are located in the [NetMtg.Install.Reg.NMRK] section.
In section [NetMtg.Install.Reg.PerUser].


--------------
Dependencies |
--------------
1.) The distributable is assumed to be called nm21.exe
	If there is a new version of NetMeeting that is distributed ( nm22.exe ),
	there are going to be some issues to make sure that nmrk.exe works with
	the new distributable.


2.) INF file dependencies ( See item #7 in imelplementation section above )
	To locate the keys:
	HKCU,\"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory\",\"Name"
and	HKCU,\"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory\",\"Count"
	from the default .inf file, the locations of these keys relative to
	their section is hard-coded. Also,the names of the keys is hard-coded.
	This was done in the interest of simplicity.  However, NMRK is sensitive
	to changes in the distributable .inf file. The following assumptions are
	made:

	1.) Every netmeeting setup environment executes at least one of the sections
			[DefaultInstall], or [DefaultInstall.NT]. 
	2.) The order in which the above sections appear is [DefaultInstall], 
			then [DefaultInstall.NT].
	3.) In each of the above sections, there are two subsections, AddReg and
			DelReg.
	4.) The order in which these subsections appear is AddReg, then DelReg
	5.) The default .inf file does not have sections titled 
			[NetMtg.Install.Reg.NMRK] or [NetMtg.Install.DeleteReg.NMRK]
	6.) The default .inf file uses the section [NetMtg.Install.Reg.PerUser]
			for all installtion environments.
	7.) The default .inf file has the following format for 
			section [NetMtg.Install.Reg.PerUser]:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// somewhere in the MsNetMtg.inf file


[NetMtg.Install.Reg.PerUser]
<WHITE SPACE>
HKCU,"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory","Count<ANYCHAR*><ENDLINE>
HKCU,"%KEY_CONFERENCING%\\UI\\Directory","Name<ANYCHAR*><ENDLINE>

// END /* somewhere in the MsNetMtg.inf file */ 


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
SEE: in file NmAkWiz.cpp: bool CNmAkWiz::_CreateNewInfFile( void )
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

3.) NMRK will fail if the following registry key is not there:
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NMRK\InstallationDirectory
		NMRK expects to find that registry key.  If it is not present, 
			NMRK will fail with a message stating that the NetMeeting
			Resource Kit was not properly installed				
4.) File locations:
		
		<nmrk root path> == 
			   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NMRK\InstallationDirectory
			
			nmrk.exe is located in this directory

		<nmrk root path>\tools
			updfile.exe is located in this directory and is used to update
				the .INF file in the custom distributable

		<nmrk root path>\output
			This is the default location for the nm21c.exe custom distributable
		
		<nmrk root path>\source
			This is the default location for the nm21.exe original dist. file
			
		%TEMP%\nmrktmp
			This directory is a temp directory that NMRK creates to extract the
			files needed to create the custom distributable

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND SETUP
=============================

Microsoft(R) NetMeeting(R) enables real-time audio, video, and 
data communication over the Internet. 

In order to use Microsoft NetMeeting, you must have the 
following configuration:

- Microsoft Windows(R) 95 or Windows(R) 98
- At least a 486/66 processor with 8 megabytes of RAM 
  (Pentium with 12 MB of RAM recommended)

	--or--

- Microsoft Windows NT(R) version 4.0
- At least a 486/66 processor with 16 megabytes of RAM 
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 required to enable 
  sharing applications on Windows NT


IMPORTANT NOTES:

  * NetMeeting does not run on Windows version 3.1 or beta 
    versions of Windows 98 older than Beta 3. 

  * It is strongly recommended that you uninstall earlier beta 
    versions of Microsoft NetMeeting before installing NetMeeting 
    2.1.

- If you use special characters, such as "\\" or double-byte 
  characters, when typing the installation location for NetMeeting 
  during setup, NetMeeting may not install correctly.

- NetMeeting no longer supports placing calls over IPX or over 
  PSTN.

- NetMeeting works best with a fast Internet connection (a 28.8k-
  baud or faster modem or a local area network).

- To use the audio features of NetMeeting, you need a sound card, 
  speakers, and a microphone.

- To send video with NetMeeting, you need either a video-capture 
  card and camera or a video camera that connects through your 
  computer's parallel (printer) port. You will not be able to 
  send video on some computers with a processor slower than a 
  Pentium.

  Computers with a bidirectional (ECP or EPP) parallel port will 
  perform noticeably better with parallel port video cameras than 
  computers with a unidirectional parallel port.

  Cameras that connect to a video-capture card will use less of 
  your computer's processor than cameras that connect through your 
  computer's parallel port. It is recommended that you do not use 
  a color parallel port camera unless your computer is at least a 
  Pentium 133.

- The application-sharing feature may not perform well while you 
  are using audio and video and are connected over a slow 
  connection. Additionally, you might experience "choppy" audio 
  while using video.

  The default setting for video over a 28.8-baud modem connection 
  is medium quality. To change this setting, click the Tools menu, 
  click Options, click the Video tab, and then change the Video 
  Quality option.

- Windows NT users will be able to share applications if they have
  installed Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0. 

For more information about NetMeeting, including the NetMeeting 
Resource Kit, see http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/.

For the NetMeeting Software Development Kit (SDK), see  
http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/sdk.

For information about product support, see the Support.txt
file in your Windows or NetMeeting program directory.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you uninstall Windows NT Service Pack 3 after installing 
  NetMeeting 2.1, you will receive an error message when you 
  restart your computer. To prevent this, carry out the following 
  steps:

  1. Close the error message window.

  2. In the Display properties dialog box, click Cancel. 

  3. In Control Panel, click the Devices icon.

  4. Click mnmdd, and then click the Startup button.

  5. Change the Startup Type from System to Disabled, and then 
     click OK.

  6. Restart your computer so the change can take effect.


USING MICROSOFT NETMEETING
==========================

- Microsoft NetMeeting includes support for the H.323 audio 
  and video conferencing standard. NetMeeting can be used to 
  place calls to and receive calls from products that are H.323-
  compatible, including the Intel Internet Video Phone. With 
  appropriate equipment and services that are currently under
  development by third parties, NetMeeting can place a call to 
  a telephone using an H.323 gateway.

- Microsoft maintains the following directory servers on the 
  Internet:

  ils.microsoft.com
  ils1.microsoft.com
  ils2.microsoft.com
  ils3.microsoft.com
  ils4.microsoft.com
  ils5.microsoft.com

  You can use one of these even if it does not appear in the list 
  of servers in the wizard.

  You can also use the following directory servers not maintained 
  by Microsoft:

  ils.four11.com
  ils.business.four11.com
  ils.family.four11.com

  NOTE
  * You will not be able to use these servers to locate people on 
    the Internet if you connect to the Internet through a proxy 
    server that does not support Remote WinSock. 

- Audio and video work only over TCP/IP and with one other person 
  at a time. 

- If you use this version of NetMeeting to call someone who 
  is using NetMeeting 2.0, the call-switching feature may not work 
  correctly.
  
- This version of NetMeeting enables up to 32 users to share an 
  application. However if a computer running NetMeeting 2.0 is in 
  the conference and more than three users are sharing, that computer 
  will not be able to host an application. In addition, you can be 
  connected to only one other person with audio and video at a time.
  
  The total number of people who can successfully participate 
  in your meeting will vary based on available network bandwidth 
  and the speed of the participants' computers.

- Some activities cause large amounts of data to be sent between 
  the computers in your meeting (for example, speaking and sharing 
  several applications while transferring a large file). In extreme 
  cases, this might cause computers in the meeting to become very 
  slow. To remedy this, stop one or more of the meeting activities.

- If you try to make a TCP/IP call on your local area network or 
  through a proxy server and MSN or Dial-Up Networking displays a 
  connection dialog box, you can disable this by clicking the 
  Internet icon in Control Panel and then making sure that Auto-
  Dial is not selected.

- Sharing of DirectX, OpenGL, MS-DOS(R), and graphics-intensive 
  games and AVIs does not work well and is not supported. 

- If different computers have different screen resolutions during 
  a meeting, the shared windows can be as large as the highest 
  resolution desktop allows. Users with lower resolution desktops 
  must scroll to view windows that don't fit their screens.

- You must have a 32-bit TCP/IP stack and Windows sockets 
  interface to use NetMeeting with TCP/IP. NetMeeting has 
  been tested with the 32-bit TCP/IP and Windows sockets built 
  into Windows 95 and Windows NT version 4.0.

- Application-sharing, Whiteboard, and Chat might not work 
  properly between computers with different language settings 
  and keyboard layouts.

- Microsoft NetMeeting supports using Windows 95 and Windows NT 
  version 4.0 system policies to set default configurations in 
  a corporate environment. 

  Microsoft NetMeeting system policies are documented, and a 
  system policy file is included in the NetMeeting Resource Kit. 
  For more information about the NetMeeting Resource Kit, see 
  http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/reskit.

- If NetMeeting hangs when it starts, check to see whether 
  there are damaged fonts in your Fonts folder. 

- If you are using Internet Explorer 4.0 in Offline mode and 
  you try to start NetMeeting, NetMeeting will not automatically
  connect to the Internet. To work around this problem, dial 
  up using RAS (for Windows NT computers) or Dial-Up Networking 
  (for Windows 95 computers). Or, in Internet Explorer, click the 
  File menu, and then click Work Offline to clear the check mark.

- NetMeeting does not function properly over SLIRP connections 
  or other simulated SLIP/PPP connections.


PLACING A CALL
==============

You can place Microsoft NetMeeting calls to multiple users. Any 
person in a meeting can place NetMeeting calls to other people. 
In addition, other people can join a NetMeeting call in progress 
by calling one of the participants.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you cannot connect to someone by using their computer name, 
  try using their IP address.

- If you click someone's name in the Web directory and get a 
  message asking whether you would like to open or save the file, 
  select open file.

- If you click someone's name in the Web directory and get a 
  message saying that the file type is unrecognized, you need 
  to configure your browser to associate the ILS directory files 
  with Microsoft NetMeeting. 

  For instructions on how to do this, refer to your browser 
  documentation. You will need the following information:

  MIME file type: "text/iuls"
  Command line: "rundll32.exe msconf.dll,NewMediaPhone %l"

  MIME file type: "text/h323"
  Command line: "rundll32.exe msconf.dll,NewMediaPhone %l"

- Some ISDN devices are configured to automatically connect to 
  the network. This might cause the ISDN device to try to connect 
  to the network while NetMeeting is running. To stop this from 
  happening, turn off Auto-Dial on the ISDN device.

- If you do not see your name in the directory, you might not be 
  logged on, or you might be logged on to a different directory 
  server. To change the directory server you log on to, click the 
  Tools menu, click Options, click Calling, and then change your 
  Server Name. 

  To log on to the directory server, click the Call menu, and 
  then click Log On To [your directory server].

- If you have an active network connection using a network card 
  and a second active connection using a second network card, 
  you might not be able to connect to the directory.

- If you experience connection problems when dialing via a null
  modem connection, try lowering the baud rate for your modem.

- Some conference bridges (also known as Multipoint Conferencing 
  Units, or MCUs) are case-sensitive, so when you type the 
  conference name to place a call, you may need to use the same 
  capitalization as that shown on the bridge.

- To receive calls over a null modem cable, click the Tools menu, 
  click Options, and then click the Protocols tab. Select the 
  Null Modem protocol, and then click Properties. Select the COM 
  port to which the null modem cable is connected.

- NetMeeting does not detect incoming calls on a COM port to 
  which a null modem cable is connected. To receive calls over 
  a null modem cable, you must place a call on the COM port.

- Changes made to the COM port properties in NetMeeting apply 
  only in NetMeeting. It is recommended that you do not change 
  the COM port settings while you are placing or participating 
  in a NetMeeting call.

- NetMeeting uses the COM port typed into the New Call dialog box 
  to place the call, not the COM port specified in the Null Modem 
  Protocol Properties dialog box.

- NetMeeting can use only COM1 and COM2 to place and receive null 
  modem calls.

- Null modem calls at high baud rates may not work.

- If you connect to someone through a proxy server, you may need 
  to manually connect audio and video after joining the call.


RECEIVING A CALL
================

You are ready to receive incoming calls if you are running 
Microsoft NetMeeting and have not selected Do Not Disturb on 
the Call menu.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you are not able to receive calls, it may be because your IP 
  address is registered incorrectly with the directory service. 
  You can prevent this by releasing the LAN IP address before 
  connecting to the Internet. To release the IP address, do the 
  following:

  On Windows 95    Click the Start menu, click Run, and 
			 then type Winipcfg.exe

  On Windows NT    Click the Start menu, click Run, and 
 			 then type Ipconfig /release


SHARING AN APPLICATION
======================
 
Any person in a meeting can share an application with the other 
participants. When you share an application, other people can 
see the application. When you Collaborate, other people can both 
see and use the application.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- Windows NT users will be able to share applications if they 
  have installed Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0. 

- If NetMeeting is installed in a directory where the path 
  contains extended characters, application sharing might not 
  work.

- Sharing one Windows Explorer window shares all of them. If you 
  run a program while sharing Windows Explorer, the program will 
  also be shared. 
  
  Examples of Windows Explorer windows include Control Panel, 
  Briefcase, the Received Files folder, or any Windows Explorer 
  folder.

- Internet Explorer 4.0 users: If you share a Windows Explorer 
  window, with collaboration enabled, and the person with whom 
  you are collaborating closes the window, all applications and 
  windows that you open afterwards will be shared.

  To undo sharing in this situation, open a Windows Explorer 
  window again, and un-share it. 

- When you share an application and collaborate, remote users 
  can use the File Open and File Save dialog boxes in your 
  application to gain access to or delete files on your computer 
  or network. 

  To stop someone from using your shared program while you do 
  not have control of the cursor, press ESC. 
  
  To stop someone from using your shared program while you do 
  have control of the cursor, click the Stop Collaborating 
  button.
  
  It is recommended that you do not leave your computer unattended 
  while sharing an application and collaborating.

- When you launch another application from within the application 
  you are sharing (such as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from 
  within Microsoft Word), there's a possiblity that the recently 
  launched application won't be shared properly. 

- You cannot drag an object onto a shared application or drag an 
  object from a shared application to the desktop.

- When you share an application with an Input Method Editor 
  (IME), you should show the IME status bar so that other 
  people can use the mouse to activate the IME.

  If the IME does not support showing the status bar, or if other 
  people are having trouble activating the IME, you should 
  activate and deactivate the IME for them.

- If the IME window fails to repaint during a meeting, you can 
  cause it to repaint by clicking anywhere on the desktop.

- You may not be able to share applications on a computer with a 
  product installed that has application sharing or remote 
  control features.
  

WHITEBOARD
==========

The Whiteboard enables you to draw simultaneously with other 
people. Everyone in the meeting can see what is drawn on the 
Whiteboard. When one person in a meeting runs Whiteboard, it 
appears on everyone's screen.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- On a computer running Windows NT, if the directory in which 
  NetMeeting is installed contains spaces in its name, you 
  will not be able to run Whiteboard or Chat.

- Whiteboard does not maximize to the full size of an 1152 by 
  864 or larger display.
  

CHAT
====

Chat enables you to type messages for other users to see. When 
one person in a meeting runs Chat, it appears on everyone's 
screen.

Chat files are stored with the .txt file extension. If Microsoft 
Notepad, or another program that can read files in .txt format, 
is installed on your computer, it can be used to open Chat files. 

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- On a computer running Windows NT, if the directory in which 
  NetMeeting is installed contains spaces in its name, you will 
  not be able to run Whiteboard or Chat.


FILE TRANSFER
=============

- Files dragged onto the list of people on the Current Call tab 
  are sent to all the people in the meeting. 

- To send a file to a specific person, right-click that person's 
  name in the list of people in the meeting, and then click Send 
  File. 

- To send a file to everyone in the meeting, click the Tools
  menu, click File Transfer, and then click Send File. 

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you try to send a shortcut to a file, the actual file will 
  be sent instead.

- Exchanging files with Intel ProShare 2.0 does not always work 
  properly.


AUDIO COMMUNICATION
===================

- Audio is supported only over TCP/IP and with one other person.

- Sound quality can vary significantly depending on your sound 
  card and microphone. 

- Using full-duplex audio can require both more bandwidth and 
  more CPU than using half-duplex audio, and therefore may result 
  in poor sound quality.

- If you modify your sound card device driver in any way, such 
  as upgrading to a full-duplex driver, you will need to run the 
  Audio Tuning Wizard again in order for NetMeeting to work 
  correctly.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you are using a Videum (Winnov) video-capture card and 
  have the new 2.0 drivers, you can change the audio input for 
  the card by opening the Videum Configure program (under the 
  Winnov Videum program group) and selecting the desired audio 
  input for the video input being used with Netmeeting. The default 
  is to use the Camera microphone for the MXC video connection 
  and Line Input for all other video connections. After you do 
  this, the correct audio input will be selected when you start 
  NetMeeting.

- Audio input for users of Winnov cameras will automatically be 
  switched whenever video is in use. If your video is connected 
  using the MXC connection, the camera input will be used for 
  audio. If your video is connected using the Composite or 
  S-Video connection, the Line Input will be used for audio. 
  You can solve this problem by upgrading to the new 2.0 drivers 
  and by using the Videum Configuration application.

- Users of Microsoft NetMeeting and Intel Internet Video Phone 
  can talk to each other only if both users have a computer with 
  a Pentium processor.

- If you have a SoundBlaster sound card with full-duplex sound 
  enabled, and you have problems with your computer locking up 
  when using NetMeeting, you may need to update your Sound-
  Blaster drivers.

- You may receive a message in the Audio Tuning Wizard that 
  explains that your sound card is unsupported. This occurs when 
  the sound card does not support some of the features required 
  for it to be supported by NetMeeting. The audio features in 
  NetMeeting may work even if you get this message, but you might 
  experience poor audio quality. 

  If your sound card is unsupported, you might want to contact 
  the manufacturer to find out if newer sound card drivers are 
  available.

- If you are experiencing "choppy" full-duplex sound quality, try 
  switching NetMeeting to half-duplex sound quality. To do this, 
  carry out the following steps:

  1. Make sure that you are not in a NetMeeting call.

  2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

  3. On the Audio tab, clear the Enable Full Duplex Audio check 
     box.

  It is recommended that you not switch between full-duplex and 
  half-duplex audio while in a meeting with audio.

- If you are having problems with your audio quality or sound 
  card when using NetMeeting, the problems could be related to 
  your hardware configuration or driver installation. To see 
  the latest support information, click the Help menu, and then 
  click Online Support.

- If your computer has more than one audio device, you should 
  make sure that the audio devices selected in the Audio Tuning 
  Wizard match the selections in the Multimedia properties in 
  Control Panel.

- If you upgrade your computer's processor, you should re-run 
  the audio tuning wizard.

- Full-duplex audio might not work with Media Vision Pro Audio 
  Spectrum 16 sound cards.

- Computers with a 486 processor will not be able to use audio 
  with other software based on the H.323 audio conferencing 
  standard over a Dial-Up Networking (modem) connection. They 
  will be able to use audio with other NetMeeting users over 
  a Dial-Up Networking connection or with other H.323-based 
  audio conferencing products over a local area network (LAN).

- When you are in an audio conference using NetMeeting, an 
  application that has the ability to record sound, such as 
  Microsoft PowerPoint, will appear to be recording sound 
  as instructed. However, since NetMeeting is already using 
  the sound card, the other application is not actually 
  recording.

- If you have a Tecra 740, you may need to manually set 
  the microphone volume level in the Multimedia properties 
  in Control Panel.

- If you experience poor audio quality, try clearing the 
  Microphone check box and then selecting it again.

- If you are using a Gravis Ultrasound sound card and you 
  are experiencing choppy audio quality, try the following:

  1. Make sure that you are not in a NetMeeting call.

  2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

  3. On the General tab, in the Network bandwidth section, 
     select a bandwidth setting that is slower than the 
     current selection.

HANGING UP
==========

When you hang up, you disconnect anyone you called or anyone 
who called you. If the disconnected users have invited or 
accepted other users into the meeting, they are also disconnected. 
Audio connections between people might not be disconnected.

Warnings and Known Bugs
-----------------------
- If you are using a 56 kps modem in a NetMeeting call with two 
  or more other people, hanging up may not work correctly. 
  Switching audio and video during the call may also cause one 
  or more participants to be disconnected.


VIDEO
=====

- To use the video features of NetMeeting, you need either a 
  video-capture card and camera or a video camera that connects 
  through your computer's parallel (printer) port. Sending video 
  does not work on some computers that have a processor slower 
  than a Pentium.

- Video is supported only over TCP/IP and with only one other 
  person at a time.

- Running video in a multiuser meeting can negatively impact 
  performance on all the computers in the meeting. For example, 
  opening a video window while sharing an application can make 
  it difficult for others to take control of the application.

- If you have more than one video device installed, or you have 
  not properly uninstalled a video device that was previously 
  installed, you might not be able to use video.

- If your video device is not properly uninstalled and you have 
  enabled video in NetMeeting, the remaining camera software 
  may warn you repeatedly that it cannot find the camera.

- If your computer's processor is slower than a Pentium, sending 
  video may result in poor audio and video quality.

- Computers with a bidirectional (ECP or EPP) parallel port will 
  perform noticeably better with parallel video cameras than 
  computers with a unidirectional parallel port.

- Cameras that connect to a video-capture card will use less of 
  your computer's processor than cameras that connect through 
  your computer's parallel port. It is recommended that you not 
  use a color parallel port camera unless your computer is at 
  least a Pentium 133.

- If you disconnect your camera while using the video features 
  in NetMeeting, your camera's software may display messages 
  telling you that the camera is not responding. To disable 
  these messages, click the Tools menu, click Options, click 
  Video, and then clear the Automatically Send Video At The 
  Start Of Each Call check box.

- It is recommended that you not run another program that uses 
  video while running NetMeeting.

- If some areas of your video window contain the wrong colors, 
  your camera might be aimed at an area with insufficient light. 
  Some video drivers might provide a low-light filter option.

- If you are using the video features in a dark area, some 
  cameras will cause your computer to become extremely slow 
  and unresponsive.

- If you use a Black and White Connectix Camera, it is 
  recommended that you use the version 2.1 update (or newer) 
  of the video drivers. You can download drivers from 
  http://www.connectix.com. 

- Audio input for users of Winnov cameras will automatically be 
  switched whenever video is in use. If your video is connected 
  using the MXC connection, the camera input will be used for 
  audio. If your video is connected using the Composite or 
  S-Video connection, the Line Input will be used for audio.

- With some cameras, you may be able to reduce CPU usage by 
  manually adjusting the settings in the Source and Format 
  dialog boxes instead of letting the video driver software 
  do it automatically.


GENERAL KNOWN ISSUES
====================

- You cannot run ReachOut 5.0 on computers on which Microsoft 
  NetMeeting is installed.

- To find the name that NetMeeting uses as your NetBIOS name, 
  carry out the following steps:

  1. In Control Panel, click the Network icon, and then click the 
     Identification tab.

  2. Select the Computer Name text box.

- If you use User Profiles for multiple users to maintain your 
  Windows preferences on all the computers on a network, you 
  might have to run the Audio Tuning Wizard again when you switch 
  computers. 

- Both Microsoft FrontPage and Microsoft NetMeeting currently use 
  the same file type (.cnf). NetMeeting uses this file type for
  Speed Dials.

- When you are in a meeting, your Clipboard is shared with 
  everyone else in the meeting. This enables you to paste objects 
  other people cut or copy to the Clipboard into your local 
  programs. You can set a system policy that disables Clipboard 
  sharing.

- If you are running Windows 95 Version 4.00.950B, and you cancel
  the Dial-Up Networking dialog box that appears when you start 
  NetMeeting, NetMeeting appears to stop responding; however, 
  NetMeeting will work properly after about two minutes. However, 
  you will not be logged onto the directory server until you manually 
  connect to your Internet service provider and then on the Call 
  menu, choose Log On To [your directory server].

- If you create a SpeedDial shortcut, clicking Send To Mail 
  Recipient will work only if your e-mail program is MAPI-aware
  (for example, Microsoft Outlook Express).

- You can return calls by using the History tab only if 
  the person who called you was using NetMeeting 2.0 or 
  NetMeeting 2.1.

- If you are using NetMeeting over a 28.8 kbp connection, you may  
  be able to get better audio and video quality by clicking the 
  Tools menu, clicking Options, and then choosing ISDN or Local 
  Area Network from the Network Bandwidth section.


WINDOWS NT ISSUES
=================

- If you use Windows NT, you will be able to share applications 
  if you have installed Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0. 

- Enabling Application Sharing on Windows NT may negatively 
  affect the performance of your display driver. This will affect 
  the rate at which information is drawn on the screen.

- Some Creative Labs SoundBlaster drivers (specifically those
  posted on their Web site January 15, 1997) are not compatible 
  with NetMeeting. SoundBlaster drivers that come with Windows 
  NT 4.0. do work with NetMeeting, as do the more recently 
  posted drivers, which also support full-duplex audio. 

- If you use Windows NT, you will experience problems if 
  you share a 32-bit application and then insert an object 
  that is a package. This opens the Object Packager, which is 
  automatically shared and will subsequently fault. This fault 
  will not cause the original shared application or NetMeeting 
  to fault, only the Object Packager.

- If you enabled the floating point workaround during 
  installation of Windows NT on a computer that is equipped 
  with a flawed Intel Pentium chip, NetMeeting audio quality 
  will be poor, or audio will not work at all.

- When you share a 16-bit application, all the 16-bit applications
  that are running on your computer will also automatically be 
  shared.

- If you are using NetMeeting on Windows NT and you are unable to 
  receive a call, restart your computer and try again.

- If you do not have a sound card, you will need to manually 
  specify the bandwidth of your connection. To do this, click 
  the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Network Bandwidth.

- You may need to uninstall Dial-Up Networking in order to log  
  on to a Directory Server via a proxy.

- If, after placing a call, you see a message for more than one 
  minute that NetMeeting is waiting for a response from the 
  other person, quit NetMeeting and then try to contact the 
  person again.

- If you are unable to see a video image in NetMeeting, it is 
  recommended that you upgrade to DirectDraw 3.0 or newer.

- If you suspend your computer, or if it is set to suspend 
  automatically, you should quit and then restart NetMeeting 
  after resuming.

- If you receive a SpeedDial in an e-mail message, your mail 
  program may convert it to a text (.txt) file. You will be 
  able to use it as a SpeedDial if you rename it with a .cnf 
  extension.

[DirData]

; The path directive specifies where the CCDx.DAT will be kept. If you want
; it stored on the root of the drive CCD scanned, specify
;
;	path=*:\
;
; If you want it, for example, to be stored in a CCD directory on C:, specify:
;
;	path=c:\ccd\
;
path=*:\


[Options]

; The entiretree directive tells CCD what to do if you invoke CCD with no
; command line arguments. If entiretree=1, CCD will display all the directories
; on your disk. You can then choose where you want to go using speed search. If
; entiretree=0, CCD will only show you the directories that are descendants of
; the current directory
entiretree=1

; The nodrive directive tells CCD not to change the current drive when it changes
; directory. nodrive=1 is more like the built in CD command, but less useful
; IMO. When nodrive=0 CCD will not only change the directory, but it will change
; the drive as well.
nodrive=0

; The chasehidden directive tells CCD whether or not to chase hidden/system
; directories when scanning the disk
chasehidden=0

; The heuristics directive specifies how CCD munges what you typed at the command
; line for CCD. By default, CCD has 10 heuristics it goes through to try and
; find the directory for you. The format is
; // { chToReplace strWith { "," chToReplace strWith }  ";" }
;
; For example, a string of "; \; \,\**\;" would have three heuristics
; 1. no replacements, just see if what you typed exists
; 2. replace all spaces with slashes
; 3. first replace all spaces with slashes, then replace all slashes (including
;    those slashes that replaced spaces) with **\
;
; Each heuristic is attempted first with no trailing wildcard, then with a
; wildcard.

MAPCAT can be used to extract the information in a map file so that it can be then read into Excel for analysis.  The primary reason I have read map files into Excel is to use pivot tables on the results.  An example of the output of map cat (used on mapcat itself): Target Class Symbol Object Segment SegClass mapcat FGetFlag mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat Segment PsegFind mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat MapCat mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat FFilter mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat szLibFilter mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat szObjFilter mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat szSymFilter mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat szClassFilter mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat Segment s_psegHead mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchNull mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchVtable mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchStringConst mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchCtor mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchDtor mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchImport mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgchExport mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgszOps mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat rgszOps2 mapcat 7/6/95 mapcat StringConstant mapcat 7/6/95 Mapcat simply decodes some of the most common "decorated names", and turns the map file data into tab delimited format.  For each symbol in the map, the cat file contains the following fields: Field Description Target Name of the target program (exe or dll) Class If the symbol is associate with a C++ class, the class name is here.  Symbols not associated with classes have a blank Class field. Symbol The function, method, or variable symbol name.  Some symbols are constructed automatically from special decorated names.  Some of the more interesting ones are   (constructor),   (destructor),  VFTABLE  (class vtable data),  StringConstant  (statically allocated strings). If code comes from a library - the library name is here.  Blank otherwise. Object The name of the object file that contains the symbol (usually the same as the source file name). Segment The name of the segment containing the symbol SegClass The segment class of the symbol (CODE or DATA) The date the mapfile was generated. The size of the symbol.  This may be inaccurate in some cases.  The map file only contains the address of each symbol in the image, not the size.  The size is inferred by subtracting the addresses of adjacent symbols. Type is an optional field that can be inserted by using the -type command line flag.  This can be used for merging multiple   files together for a comparative analysis.   For example, you can compile your program using structured exception handling, and then compile it without structured exception handling.  Cat files can be created from both of these builds using a different Type value (e.g. mapcat -type:SEH myprogram, and mapcat -type:NoSEH myprogram). What can I do with Mapcat? An example pivot table produced by reading a mapcat file into Excel:  EMBED Excel.Sheet.5   You can see that there is a total of 2,423 bytes of actual code generated by mapcat, and it uses 3,232 bytes of data, most of it contained in various string constants.  There is only one C++ class definition, a class called  Segment , and that class only has a single method defined (PsegFind), and a global member (s_psegHead) Lots of other interesting questions can be answered using mapcat. How much code is generated for certain  features  in my program (if you know the associated classes)? How much code is in common (duplicated) between an EXE and a DLL that share some object files in their construction? How has the size of my program changed over time, and where have the changes occurred? How is the size of my program affected by changing various compiler options? How much space is consumed by vtables in my program (look at all VFTABLE symbols). What small class member functions should I consider for inlining? How do I use mapcat? Once you have a map file for your program mapcat is very simple to use.  If your map file is called myprog.map, you can just use the command: mapcat myprog Mapcat will read in the mapfile and produce a file called myprog.cat.  Now you can simply load myprog.cat into Excel (just click  Finish  on the text file import wizard to use the default import options).  Then use the Data/Pivot Table command to convert the raw data to pivot table format. There are several command line options for mapcat.  All but the  -type  option are used to filter and reduce the size of the output file. Option Description -type:typestring This option (described above) allows you to add an additional column to the mapcat output file.  The Type column will be added, and all rows will contain the provided  typestring .  This is useful when you will be combining the output of multiple runs of mapcat so you can differentiate them in a pivot table. -class:classname Output only those symbols associated with a specific class name. -symbol:symbolname Output only those symbols associated with a specific symbol name.  The symbol can be one of the  generated  symbols, like  VFTABLE , or  StringConstant -lib:libname Output only those symbols that come from a particular library. -object:objectname Output only those symbols that are located in a given named object file. -minsize:X Output only those symbols that have a size greater than or equal to X -maxsize:X Output only those symbols that have a size less than or equal to X  Segment has an inline constructor.  Inline functions will not show up in the map since their code is distributed among each use.  The converse question,  What large class member inline functions should I consider making function calls? , is harder to answer.  Our approach has been to have an option to compile all inline functions as not inline, and to have them all be generated in a standard named cpp file (like stdinl.cpp).  We can then compile a version where we can look at the size of the inline functions in the map file. Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Default Paragraph Font Footnote Text Footnote Reference CatTable SLMCAT - an SLM history categorization program written by Mike Koss (mikeko) 8/28/95 What is slmcat? SLMCAT can be used to extract historical information from an SLM project.  It reads the diff files of the project directly and outputs information on numbers of lines checked in at which times, and by whom. SLMCAT can be used to extract the information in an slm project so that it can be then read into Excel for analysis.  Pivot tables can then be used on the results.  An example of the output of slmcat (used on the slmcat project itself): Author Comment Reviewer Version listp.cpp 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO init slmcat files listp.h 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO init slmcat files listp.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO inlude prob slmcat.cpp 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO init slmcat files slmcat.cpp 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO normalize and error handling slmcat.mak 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO init slmcat files slmcat.mak 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO normalize and error handling std.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO missing file Slmcat pulls information from the diff files and converts it to tab delimited format.  There are three primary modes of slmcat.  The default mode, is purely a translation of each checkin to its tab delimitted fields.  The fields displayed in the default mode are: Field Description The (sub) directory of the project from which the file is taken.  Useful for large, multi-directory projects. The name of the file. The date and time that the checkin was made. Author The name of the person who did the checkin.  Note that slmcat will munge the output of this field somewhat to try to find the real email name of the person doing the checkin.  For that reason, numerals are removed from the suffix of the name as well as the suffixes  -DEV, LT, and HM Commnet The text of the comment for that checkin. Reviewer The name of the person who reviewed the checkin (it assumes this information is encoded in the comment by having the reviewers name appear in brackets or parenthesis at the suffix of the comment; e.g.,  Fixed some bugs [mikeko] Version The version number of the file for this checkin. The total number of lines added to the file. The difference between the total adds, and total line deletions from the file.  The sum of all the Net lines should add up to the total number of lines currently in the file. Snapshot (-s) mode actually makes an assignment of ownership for each line of each file.  It then outputs a table that shows where every current line in the project comes from (i.e., each line of the file comes from some checkin at some point in time, made by some person).  A snapshot mode of the slmcat output looks like this: Mapcat simply decodes some of the most common "decorated names", and turns the map file data into tab delimited format.  For each symbol in the map, the cat file contains the following fields: Field Description Target Name of the target program (exe or dll) Class If the symbol is associate with a C++ class, the class name is here.  Symbols not associated with classes have a blank Class field. Symbol The function, method, or variable symbol name.  Some symbols are constructed automatically from special decorated names.  Some of the more interesting ones are   (constructor),   (destructor),  VFTABLE  (class vtable data),  StringConstant  (statically allocated strings). If code comes from a library - the library name is here.  Blank otherwise. Object The name of the object file that contains the symbol (usually the same as the source file name). Segment The name of the segment containing the symbol SegClass The segment class of the symbol (CODE or DATA) The date the mapfile was generated. The size of the symbol.  This may be inaccurate in some cases.  The map file only contains the address of each symbol in the image, not the size.  The size is inferred by subtracting the addresses of adjacent symbols. Type is an optional field that can be inserted by using the -type command line flag.  This can be used for merging multiple   files together for a comparative analysis.   For example, you can compile your program using structured exception handling, and then compile it without structured exception handling.  Cat files can be created from both of these builds using a different Type value (e.g. mapcat -type:SEH myprogram, and mapcat -type:NoSEH myprogram). What can I do with Mapcat? An example pivot table produced by reading a mapcat file into Excel:  EMBED Excel.Sheet.5   You can see that there is a total of 2,423 bytes of actual code generated by mapcat, and it uses 3,232 bytes of data, most of it contained in various string constants.  There is only one C++ class definition, a class called  Segment , and that class only has a single method defined (PsegFind), and a global member (s_psegHead) Lots of other interesting questions can be answered using mapcat. How much code is generated for certain  features  in my program (if you know the associated classes)? How much code is in common (duplicated) between an EXE and a DLL that share some object files in their construction? How has the size of my program changed over time, and where have the changes occurred? How is the size of my program affected by changing various compiler options? How much space is consumed by vtables in my program (look at all VFTABLE symbols). What small class member functions should I consider for inlining? How do I use mapcat? Once you have a map file for your program mapcat is very simple to use.  If your map file is called myprog.map, you can just use the command: mapcat myprog Mapcat will read in the mapfile and produce a file called myprog.cat.  Now you can simply load myprog.cat into Excel (just click  Finish  on the text file import wizard to use the default import options).  Then use the Data/Pivot Table command to convert the raw data to pivot table format. There are several command line options for mapcat.  All but the  -type  option are used to filter and reduce the size of the output file. Option Description -type:typestring This option (described above) allows you to add an additional column to the mapcat output file.  The Type column will be added, and all rows will contain the provided  typestring .  This is useful when you will be combining the output of multiple runs of mapcat so you can differentiate them in a pivot table. -class:classname Output only those symbols associated with a specific class name. -symbol:symbolname Output only those symbols associated with a specific symbol name.  The symbol can be one of the  generated  symbols, like  VFTABLE , or  StringConstant -lib:libname Output only those symbols that come from a particular library. -object:objectname Output only those symbols that are located in a given named object file. -minsize:X Output only those symbols that have a size greater than or equal to X -maxsize:X Output only those symbols that have a size less than or equal to X  Segment has an inline constructor.  Inline functions will not show up in the map since their code is distributed among each use.  The converse question,  What large class member inline functions should I consider making function calls? , is harder to answer.  Our approach has been to have an option to compile all inline functions as not inline, and to have them all be generated in a standard named cpp file (like stdinl.cpp).  We can then compile a version where we can look at the size of the inline functions in the map file. SLMCAT - an SLM history categorization program written by Mike Koss (mikeko) 8/28/95 What is slmcat? SLMCAT can be used to extract historical information from an SLM project.  It reads the diff files of the project directly and outputs information on numbers of lines checked in at which times, and by whom. SLMCAT can be used to extract the information in an slm project so that it can be then read into Excel for analysis.  Pivot tables can then be used on the results.  An example of the output of slmcat (used on the slmcat project itself): Author Comment Reviewer Version listp.cpp 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO init slmcat files listp.h 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO init slmcat files listp.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO inlude prob slmcat.cpp 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO init slmcat files slmcat.cpp 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO normalize and error handling slmcat.mak 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO init slmcat files slmcat.mak 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO normalize and error handling std.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO missing file Slmcat pulls information from the diff files and converts it to tab delimited format.  There are three primary modes of slmcat.  The default mode, is purely a translation of each checkin to its tab delimited fields.  The fields displayed in the default mode are: Field Description The (sub) directory of the project from which the file is taken.  Useful for large, multi-directory projects. The name of the file. The date and time that the checkin was made. Author The name of the person who did the checkin.  Note that slmcat will munge the output of this field somewhat to try to find the real email name of the person doing the checkin.  For that reason, numerals are removed from the suffix of the name as well as the suffixes  -DEV, LT, and HM Comment The text of the comment for that checkin. Reviewer The name of the person who reviewed the checkin (it assumes this information is encoded in the comment by having the reviewers name appear in brackets or parenthesis at the suffix of the comment; e.g.,  Fixed some bugs [mikeko] Version The version number of the file for this checkin. The total number of lines added to the file. The difference between the total adds, and total line deletions from the file.  The sum of all the Net lines should add up to the total number of lines currently in the file. Snapshot (-s) mode actually makes an assignment of ownership for each line of each file.  It then outputs a table that shows where every current line in the project comes from (i.e., each line of the file comes from some checkin at some point in time, made by some person).  A snapshot mode of the slmcat output looks like this: Author Lines listp.cpp 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO listp.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO listp.h 08/22/95 09:58 MIKEKO slmcat.cpp 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO slmcat.cpp 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO slmcat.mak 08/25/95 19:00 MIKEKO slmcat.mak 08/22/95 09:59 MIKEKO std.h 08/22/95 10:11 MIKEKO The only new field in this form of the output is: Field Description Lines This is the number of lines that are currently still in the file that are a result of the checkin at this date. The last mode is a listing mode.  It will output a listing of a given file (or files), but prepend the name of the author and the date of the checkin for each line of the file. What can I do with SLMCAT? An example pivot table produced by reading a slmcat file into Excel shows the lines that were added to the project by whom, and when.  EMBED Excel.Sheet.5   A snapshot example shows when each of the lines from the current project were checked in.  EMBED Excel.Sheet.5   The listing mode produces line that look like this: 02/14/94 MIKEKO      if (FPathOnly(pch)) 02/14/94 MIKEKO      return fFalse;  02/14/94 MIKEKO      02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("file(s) copied"); 06/08/94 RENHOEK     CONT("file(s) moved"); 06/10/94 JASONSO     CONT("LNK4077"); 10/26/94 SURYANR     CONT("LNK4042"); 06/08/94 RENHOEK     CONT("CK4009"); 06/08/94 RENHOEK     CONT("MIDL2204"); 06/08/94 RENHOEK     CONT("Assembling"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("symbols\n"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("symbol\n"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("segments\n"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("already correct version"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      CONT("Bytes symbol space free"); 06/08/94 RENHOEK     CONT(".reg"); 06/22/94 MIKEKO      CONT("set INCLUDE="); 11/04/94 T-HENRYT    CONT("cmd.exe"); 07/07/95 MIKEKO      CONT("does not exist"); 02/14/94 MIKEKO      How do I use slmcat? Slmcat is very simple to use.  You can run it from any enlisted directory of an SLM project, or from a diff file directory of an SLM source tree. slmcat > output.cat Slmcat will read in the slm.ini to find the location of the diff files for the current directory and produce its output on the standard output..  Now you can simply load output.cat into Excel (just click  Finish  on the text file import wizard to use the default import options).  Then use the Data/Pivot Table command to convert the raw data to pivot table format. There are several command line options for slmcat. Option Description Recursively append the output for slmcat to all subdirectories of the current directory. Snapshot mode. Listing mode.   Outputs an attributed file listing with each line tagged by the author and checkin date for the line. For debugging, just like -l but omits the author and date; should be identical to the currently checked in file.
