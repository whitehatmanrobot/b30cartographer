or (this is usually done by 
supplying the GUID of that event). The Controller can be made more complex by 
giving it the ability to control various parameters with respect to the buffer, 
the log file, the type of tracing, etc. 

The consumer takes the traces that are logged, and converts them to a human 
readable form for further analysis. The Consumer can be as sophisticated as the 
developer intends, for instance, an application that triggers another event 
based on some value in the event trace log.

Event tracing has a number of uses. It supplements counters, in that it allows 
one to derive various metrics not possible using simple raw counters. A
specific example is the response time metric. Event tracing allows more
detailed analysis of system events and hence can be useful for capacity
planning. Event tracing can also be used (potentially by developers) for
initial problem identification and the detection of system bottlenecks. 

Note: Since event tracing is more expensive than regular performance counters, 
it should not be used on a 7 * 24 basis.

Description of EVENT TRACING samples
====================================

There are three samples of event tracing tools included with the Event Tracing 
resource kit - Tracelog, Tracedmp and Tracedp.

TRACELOG
--------

TraceLog is a Collection Control utility. It uses the Collection Control
portion of the Event Tracing API to start and stop (among other functions)
logging sessions. The logging sessions can be provided by the NT Kernel Logger
or any provider, such as the sample trace data provider, tracedp.exe.

When using logging, this utility specifies WMI to create an ETL file containing 
information about the trace events in a binary format.  The TraceDmp sample can 
be used to read the ETL file and output a CSV and Summary text files.

The basic functions of Tracelog with respect to event tracing are -

 Starting, stopping, updating and querying a trace session

 Setting up a buffer to which the event traces are to be logged by the  
 provider

 Creating a log file to which the buffer is flushed. (Note that it              
        could also be set to real time mode in which case the buffer would be 
 delivered directly to the consumer that wants it)

 Providing more specific control over system level tracing

 Controlling the level of tracing required

Simply put, tracelog first creates a circular buffer and enables tracing. The 
provider (like the Operating System or an application, such as the DS) now 
starts tracing events. These traces are written to the buffer. When a buffer is 
filled, the data is written to a log file or if real time mode is set, then the 
consumer (such as tracedmp or another application) takes the data from the 
buffer itself.

Usage: tracelog [actions] [options] | [-h | -help | -?]

Input parameters [actions] - actions you issue with the command. These include
starting, stopping, updating, querying, and flushing a logging session, listing 
active logging sessions, enabling and disabling event providers.

Input Parameters [options] - optional parameters you issue with the action
you specified. 

Actions
-------

-start [logger name]
begins a tracing session named [logger name]. You need to give a logger name 
for the events you would like to trace but if it is a system trace, you need 
not specify any logger name, since the default logger name would be taken as 
'NT kernel logger' (see example 1 & 2).

Note System and application (like the DS) traces can be started simultaneously, 
but you would have to specify a different logger name for the application trace 
(see example 3).

-stop [logger name]
stops a tracing session named [logger name]. You have to specify the instance 
name of the events for which you would like tracing to discontinue. For 
stopping system tracing, you need not specify any logger name (see example 4).

-update [logger name]
updates the [logger name] session. This is useful when you want to change the 
file name of the log file (maybe directing it to a different disk) or change 
some buffer parameters, or change to real time mode, etc.

The following can be updated for the kernel logger (system trace) -
  
"-rt" mode switch. To switch to and from real time mode.
"-f <logfile name>" to switch logfile. 
"-ft <n>" to change flush timer.
"-max <n>" to change maximum buffers. 
"-nodisk" "-noprocess" "-nothread" "-nonet" "-fio" "-pf" "-hf" "-img" "-cm" 
flags. 

Note: These flags apply only to the NT kernel logger. All updates should be 
provided in a single update statement. If we wanted to switch to real time 
processing and increase the max number of buffers, we would issue the command

Tracelog -update -rt -max 40 (all in one statement)

-flush [logger name]
flushes the buffers used for [logger name] into a file. All the buffer used in
the sessions are emptied.

-enable [logger name]
enables event provider(s) for the [logger name] tracing session. Event 
providers are specified with GUIDs given in a file. Thus, this action is used
with -guid option.

-disable [logger name]
disables event provider(s) for the [logger name] tracing session. Event 
providers are specified with GUIDs given in a file. Thus, this action is used
with -guid option.

"-guid <file>" <file> contains a list of GUIDS for event tracing (each GUID 
corresponds to one event provider). One cannot just provide a GUID, even if
it is just one GUID; it has to be included in a file. The exception to this
is if you wish to enable Windows system tracing where no GUID file is
necessary (see example 1).

-enumguid
enumerate Registered Trace Guids.

-x
stops all traces (system and otherwise). This is a complete halt to event 
tracing.

-l
is a query to list all the ongoing traces.

-q
is a query to list the system trace only.

Buffer parameters
-----------------

-b <n bytes>
specifies the buffer size. You would generally set the size to be multiples of 
the page size (for x86 page size=4Kb). A small size increases the flush 
frequency. The kernel, depending on the memory capacity, chooses the default. 

-min <n>
number of buffers to pre-allocate. If the logging is frequent, then you want to 
set a higher number. Default is 2.

-max <n>
maximum buffers in pool. This limits the amount of memory consumed for each 
tracing session. Default is 25.

-ft <n sec>
after a buffer gets filled up, it gets flushed to the log file or to the 
consumer (in case of real time tracing). This option allows you to specify the 
time after which to force a flush, especially useful for real time tracing.

-age <n min>
if a buffer has been allocated but isn't being used (for the last n minutes),
it is freed. This is generally useful for light tracing, so that memory is
freed. Remember this has nothing to do with the maximum buffers that have been 
allocated. That value remains the same. Default is 15 minutes.

Log file options
----------------

-f <name>
specifies the log file to which the buffer will be flushed. The consumer will 
use this file for its analysis. The default name and location is
c:\logfile.etl.

Use a different file name for each instance of tracing required
(see example 5).

-seq <n Mbytes>
indicates that the logging will be sequential and the file size is n Mbytes. By 
default, logging is sequential.

-cir <n Mbytes>
indicates that logging will be circular. After the file size is reached,
logging starts from the beginning of the file again. The header information is
not lost however.

-rt 
enables real time tracing (see example 6).


Provide more specific control over system level (kernel) tracing
----------------------------------------------------------------

In order to understand these controls, it is important to understand a little 
about system level tracing. The following events can be traced at the system 
level -

Process start/end
Disk I/O
Network Tcp/ip, Udp/ip
Thread start/end
Image Load
Registry calls
File I/O
Page Fault

Of these the first 4 are enabled by default. The last 4 aren't enabled, as this 
would generate a lot of extra load (resource utilization), which we would like 
to avoid.

-noprocess
disables process start/end tracing

-nonet
disables network tracing

-nothread
disables thread start/end tracing

-nodisk
disables disk I/O tracing

-fio
enables file I/O tracing

-pf
enables tracing of soft page faults

-hf
enables tracing of hard page faults. Hard page faults are those that involve a 
physical read (i.e. read from the disk).

-img
enables image load tracing

-cm
enables registry calls tracing

-um
enables private process tracing. In this case, the buffer is established in the 
private process space instead of the kernel space (which is the default 
behavior).


Control the level of tracing required
-------------------------------------

In order to use the following options, a provider would need to have this 
functionality enabled in code. One would therefore have to check with the 
provider (like the Operating System or the Directory service), before using 
these options. 

-level <n>
a provider could have number of levels of tracing. A higher number would 
indicate a deeper level of tracing.

-flags <n>
by supplying a flag, more specific tracing can be achieved. The flag passed 
depends on what functionality the provider has implemented.

Examples
--------

1. tracelog -start
   Starts system event tracing with the log file being the default    
   c:\logfile.etl

2. tracelog -enable ds -guid control.guid
   Enables event providers specified in file "control.guid" for the tracing
   session "ds".

3. tracelog -start (starts system tracing)
   tracelog -start ds -guid control.guid -f c:\dslogfile.etl (starts DS 
   tracing)

4. tracelog -stop
   tracelog -stop ds

5. tracelog -start -f kernel_log.etl
   tracelog -start ds -guid control.guid -f ds_log.etl

6. tracelog -update 
   If current logger is a real-time logger, this will switch current logger to    
   non real-time, sequential logger.

7. tracelog -l
   Lists all active logging sessions.


TRACEDMP
--------

TraceDmp is a Data Consumer sample. It uses the Event Tracing API to read the 
.etl log files (or consume events from the log file) created by TraceLog or by 
consuming the real-time events enabled in a data provider. TraceDmp decodes
event data using the format obtained from WMI and outputs the data in a CSV 
file that conveniently loads into a database or spreadsheet program. A summary 
file is also created to show the sum of all events by each event type during 
the session time. You can use TraceDmp flags to specify only a summary file and
omit the CSV file output. 

Tracedmp gives us two ways to view the data obtained from event tracing. 

Summary.txt file - As the name suggests, this gives us a summary of the events 
traced. 

CSV (comma-separated format) file - This file sorts events in chronological 
order (increasing order of the time-stamp) thus giving us a more detailed view 
for each event.


For tracedmp to work, you need to use a log file. A log file is written by the
Event Tracer in a specific format - a header and some variable data. This 
format is interpreted by tracedmp. Whilst the header is fixed, the variable data
has to be interpreted separately for each event (eg., process start/end tracing
and disk I/O tracing have their own variable structure). This variable portion 
is determined by tracedmp through a lookup in the WMI namespace.

System event descritptors are already present in the WMI namespace by default.
For other custom events, providers should provide the WMI MOF file with the
event layout descriptions. Before running tracedmp, you should register those
event layouts by running mofcomp.exe on that mof file. For instance, the
custom events generated by tracedp.exe are registered as follows:

mofcomp -N:root\wmi tracedp.mof

The format is based on the WMI format, which uses the MOF structure. Details 
on event descriptors can be obtained by examining the mof file or by running 
WBEMTest.

Tracedmp can also be used for real time event tracing in which case the tool 
will read from the buffer itself instead of from the file. The format and 
process is similar to that described earlier for log files.



Usage: tracedmp [options] <etl file> | [-? | -h | -help]
The options are explained below:

-o <file>
specify the name of the csv  and summary file to which you would like the 
results to appear. The default files are dumpfile.csv and summary.txt and are 
placed in the tracedmp directory (see example 1).

-rt [logger name]
use this option if real time tracing is being performed. Ensure that tracelog
is also in real time mode and set the logger file name to that provided in the 
tracelog command (see example 2).

-summary
select this option if only the summary file is required. In this case, the csv 
file is not created.

Output files
-------------

Summary.txt - This contains a count of all the events that occurred while 
tracing was being performed. The GUID's for each event are also displayed. It
is important to understand the difference between Event type - start/end and
Event type - DCstart/DCend (DC=Data Collection). The former are those event
that started and ended after tracing had begun, i.e. they had their lifetime
within the tracing period. There are however processes (or threads) that had
begun even before tracing had been turned on, and continue even after tracing
is completed. For such events, their beginning is the time tracing was turned
on and their end is the time tracing was turned off. Hence we have DCstart and
DCend.

Dumpfile.csv - This file can be opened in MSExcel. It contains a list of the 
events as they occurred in chronological order. The various fields are:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Event name         Name of the event being traced                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|TID            Thread Identifer                                             |
|Clock-time     The timestamp of the event occurrence                        |
|Kernel (ms)    Time taken by that event in the kernel space                 |
|User (ms)      Time taken by the event in the user space                    |
|User data ...  The variable portion of the header. This is                  |
|               based on the MOF structure, provided in the                  |
|               MOFdata.guid file. This could be more than                   |
|               one column of data. To be able to interpret                  |
|               it, one would have tolook at the above file,                 |
|               or run WEBMTest as explained above.                          |
|IID            Instance ID                                                  |
|PIID           Parent Instance ID (to which the IID relates)                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: IID and PIID are the last two columns (rightmost columns) of the output 
file and should not be mistaken for User Data as this field could span multiple 
columns.

Examples

Tracedmp c:\logfile.etl
Tracedmp -o myoutput c:\logfile.etl
In this case, the output files will be myoutput.csv and myoutput.txt

Tracedmp -rt ds
This assumes that the ds is being traced in real time mode using the tracelog 
command.




TRACEDP
=======
TraceDp is a Data Provider sample. It demonstrates how you can provide event 
trace data to the logger or a Data Consumer from user mode code. For a kernel 
mode driver there are kernel mode equivalent APIs. 


Usage: TraceDp [options] [number of events] [-? | -h | -help]

        -UseEventTraceHeader        This is the default
        -UseEventInstanceHeader
        -UseMofPtrFlag
        
 [number of events] default is 5000

-UseEventTraceHeader
Instructs Tracdp to use the EVent trace header for logging

-UseEventInstanceHeader
Instructs Tracedp to generate instance id's for subseuqent use by the tracelog 
sample.

-UseMofptrFlag
Instructs Tracedp to use the MOF ptr flag to reference the logged data. When
this option is used, tracedp generates custom events containing various
types of data as specified in tracedp.mof.


USING THE EVENT TRACING SAMPLES
===============================

The following examples show how to use TraceLog's default settings, logging 
registry activity, and using TraceLog to control the TraceDP Data Provider 
sample.


Using the Sample's Defaults
===========================

1) Start the NT Kernel Logger by using only the -start command.  By default the 
   events are placed in the c:\LogFile.etl file.

   C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start

2) To stop the session use -stop.

   C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop


After you have started and stop a logging session you should find a file
named c:\LogFile.etl.  This files store logging events between the time
you use tracelog -start and tracelog -stop.

By default TraceLog will log information regarding processes, threads, disk,
and network I/O.

Using the NT Kernel Logger to Trace Registry Usage
==================================================

There are various details about kernel processing which is not logged by
default. You can also trace file I/O, page faults, image load information,
registry operations, and process private information. The following is an
example of retrieve trace information when creating a registry key and
adding a registry value.

1) Start the NT Kernel Logger to get Registry traces. The -cm switch stands for 
Configuration Manager, another name for Registry. Also the -noprocess, 
-nothread, -nodisk, and -nonet switches are used to remove the clutter so you
can focus on the registry events.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start -noprocess -nothread -nodisk -nonet -cm

2) After starting the logging session, use the registry editor to create a key
at a location of your choice and create a string value.

3) Next, stop the logging session for the NT Kernel Logger

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop

4) Use the TraceDmp utility to dump the information to a CSV file and Summary.
Go to the tracedmp directory and run tracedmp with no arguments.  By default
it will read the C:\LogFile.Etl and produce the DumpFile.csv and Summary.txt 
files.  Below is an example of the Summary.txt.

Using TraceLog to Control the TraceDp Sample
=============================================
TraceLog can be used with the TraceDp (Sample Data Provider) example to create 
an etl file. But first add the control guid to the Control.Guid file in the 
TraceLog directory.  This is used as input for TraceLog.

1) Open Control.Guid with Notepad.exe and add the following line.
   d58c126f-b309-11d1-969e-0000f875a5bc tracedp

The name at the end of the GUID is arbitrary.  The name will appear in the 
output CSV and summary text files.

2) Start the TraceDp sample data provide.  The following is an example usage

C:\tracedp>tracedp -UseMofPtrFlag

You should see the following output:

Trace registered successfully
Testing Logger with 5000 events

3) Start the logging session and provide the Control.Guid file as input. You'll 
need to start a new command prompt.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start tracedp -guid control.guid

Note that the name after -start is a session name and is arbitrary. At this 
point you should see the following text output with "."s printed to show 
progress:

Logging enabled to 0x0000000000000002
..........................

4) After you are satisfied with the amount of data, stop the logging session.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop tracedp -guid control.guid

5) Register the events generated by tracedp onto WMI by running mofcomp. The
WMI MOF file is given as tracedp.mof in the tracdp directory. 

6) Now use TraceDmp to dump the data that was logged.  

C:\TraceDmp>tracedmp

The following is an example the of Summary.txt file that is output.

WMI Event Tracing API Samples
=============================

This readme describes the three sample implementations of using the Event
Trace API's supplied with the SDK and a brief description of event tracing. 

The readme is organized into 3 sections - Overview, Description of Event
Tracing and Using the Event Tracing samples.


For more details please refer the Platform SDK documentation on Event Tracing.

OVERVIEW
========

An event simply represents any activity of interest, especially with respect
to performance. It is typically an activity related to the usage of a resource
such as the processor, disk, etc. Examples of operating system events are disk
I/O and page fault events. Examples of application events are the start and
end of a certain transaction (in the case of the Directory Service it could be
the start and end of a search operation). 

A trace is a discrete set of events that provide a view of the activity of 
interest over a period of time. For each event,information related to that
event is recorded. Event tracing is therefore an ordered set of events,
generally recorded to a buffer for subsequent processing.  

Event tracing works on the WMI model (details of the WMI model can be obtained 
from the Platform SDK documentation for WMI). There exists a Provider, a 
Controller and a Consumer, which act independently of each other. 

The Provider could be the Operating System or the Directory service, which 
registers its events (those that can be traced). Each event is associated with
a specific GUID (which is unique). A list of all the events and their GUIDS can
be obtained by running WBEMTest from the RUN menu (for details refer SDK 
dcumentation on 'using WBEMTest'). After registering, the Provider carries on 
with its usual activity.

When tracing is required, the Controller takes over. The controller creates a 
buffer, where the event traces are to be recorded. Tracing is then enabled for 
those events that the Controller would like to monitor (this is usually done by 
supplying the GUID of that event). The Controller can be made more complex by 
giving it the ability to control various parameters with respect to the buffer, 
the log file, the type of tracing, etc. 

The consumer takes the traces that are logged, and converts them to a human 
readable form for further analysis. The Consumer can be as sophisticated as the 
developer intends, for instance, an application that triggers another event 
based on some value in the event trace log.

Event tracing has a number of uses. It supplements counters, in that it allows 
one to derive various metrics not possible using simple raw counters. A
specific example is the response time metric. Event tracing allows more
detailed analysis of system events and hence can be useful for capacity
planning. Event tracing can also be used (potentially by developers) for
initial problem identification and the detection of system bottlenecks. 

Note: Since event tracing is more expensive than regular performance counters, 
it should not be used on a 7 * 24 basis.

Description of EVENT TRACING samples
====================================

There are three samples of event tracing tools included with the Event Tracing 
resource kit - Tracelog, Tracedmp and Tracedp.

TRACELOG
--------

TraceLog is a Collection Control utility. It uses the Collection Control
portion of the Event Tracing API to start and stop (among other functions)
logging sessions. The logging sessions can be provided by the NT Kernel Logger
or any provider, such as the sample trace data provider, tracedp.exe.

When using logging, this utility specifies WMI to create an ETL file containing 
information about the trace events in a binary format.  The TraceDmp sample can 
be used to read the ETL file and output a CSV and Summary text files.

The basic functions of Tracelog with respect to event tracing are -

 Starting, stopping, updating and querying a trace session

 Setting up a buffer to which the event traces are to be logged by the  
 provider

 Creating a log file to which the buffer is flushed. (Note that it              
        could also be set to real time mode in which case the buffer would be 
 delivered directly to the consumer that wants it)

 Providing more specific control over system level tracing

 Controlling the level of tracing required

Simply put, tracelog first creates a circular buffer and enables tracing. The 
WMI provider (like the Operating System or an application, such as the DS) now 
starts tracing events. These traces are written to the buffer. When a buffer is 
filled, the data is written to a log file or if real time mode is set, then the 
consumer (such as tracedmp or another application) takes the data from the 
buffer itself.

Usage: tracelog [options] | [-? | -h | -help]

Input Parameters [options] - parameters you issue with the command. These have 
been grouped in the order of the five functions stated in the above tool 
description.

Starting, stopping, updating and querying a trace session
---------------------------------------------------------

-guid <file>
file contains a list of GUIDS for event tracing (each GUID corresponds to a 
traceable event). One cannot just provide a GUID, even if it is just one GUID; 
it has to be included in a file. To begin system tracing, no GUID file is 
necssary (see example 1). To enable directory service events, the control.guid 
file has been provided with the tool (see example 2).

-start [logger name]
begins tracing. You need to give a logger name for the events you would like to 
trace but if it is a system trace, you need not specify any logger name, since 
the default logger name would be taken as 'NT kernel logger' (see example 1 & 
2).

Note System and application (like the DS) traces can be started simultaneously, 
but you would have to specify a different logger name for the application trace 
(see example 3).

-stop [logger name]
stops tracing. You have to specify the instance name of the events for which
you would like tracing to discontinue. For stopping system tracing, you need
not specify any logger name (see example 4).

-update [logger name]
updates the current trace. This is useful when you want to change the file name 
of the log file (maybe directing it to a different disk) or change some buffer 
parameters, or change to real time mode, etc.

The following can be updated for the kernel logger (system trace) -
  
"-rt" mode switch. To switch to and from real time mode.
"-f <logfile name>" to switch logfile. 
"-ft <n>" to change flush timer.
"-max <n>" to change maximum buffers. 
"-nodisk" "-noprocess" "-nothread" "-nonet" "-fio" "-pf" "-hf" "-img" "-cm" 
flags. 

Note: These flags apply only to the NT kernel logger. All updates should be 
provided in a single update statement. If we wanted to switch to real time 
processing and increase the max number of buffers, we would issue the command

Tracelog -update -rt -max 40 (all in one statement)

-x
stops all traces (system and otherwise). This is a complete halt to event 
tracing.

-l
is a query to list all the ongoing traces.

-q
is a query to list the system trace only.

Buffer parameters
-----------------

-b <n bytes>
specifies the buffer size. You would generally set the size to be multiples of 
the page size (for x86 page size=4Kb). A small size increases the flush 
frequency. The kernel, depending on the memory capacity, chooses the default. 

-min <n>
number of buffers to pre-allocate. If the logging is frequent, then you want to 
set a higher number. Default is 2.

-max <n>
maximum buffers in pool. This limits the amount of memory consumed for each 
tracing session. Default is 25.

-ft <n sec>
after a buffer gets filled up, it gets flushed to the log file or to the 
consumer (in case of real time tracing). This option allows you to specify the 
time after which to force a flush, especially useful for real time tracing.

-age <n min>
if a buffer has been allocated but isn't being used (for the last n minutes),
it is freed. This is generally useful for light tracing, so that memory is
freed. Remember this has nothing to do with the maximum buffers that have been 
allocated. That value remains the same. Default is 15 minutes.

Log file options
----------------

-f <name>
specifies the log file to which the buffer will be flushed. The consumer will 
use this file for its analysis. The default name and location is
c:\logfile.etl.

Use a different file name for each instance of tracing required
(see example 5).

-seq <n Mbytes>
indicates that the logging will be sequential and the file size is n Mbytes. By 
default, logging is sequential.

-cir <n Mbytes>
indicates that logging will be circular. After the file size is reached,
logging starts from the beginning of the file again. The header information is
not lost however.

-rt 
enables real time tracing (see example 6).


Provide more specific control over system level (kernel) tracing
----------------------------------------------------------------

In order to understand these controls, it is important to understand a little 
about system level tracing. The following events can be traced at the system 
level -

Process start/end
Disk I/O
Network Tcp/ip, Udp/ip
Thread start/end
Image Load
Registry calls
File I/O
Page Fault

Of these the first 4 are enabled by default. The last 4 aren't enabled, as this 
would generate a lot of extra load (resource utilization), which we would like 
to avoid.

-noprocess
disables process start/end tracing

-nonet
disables network tracing

-nothread
disables thread start/end tracing

-nodisk
disables disk I/O tracing

-fio
enables file I/O tracing

-pf
enables tracing of soft page faults

-hf
enables tracing of hard page faults. Hard page faults are those that involve a 
physical read (i.e. read from the disk).

-img
enables image load tracing

-cm
enables registry calls tracing

-um
enables private process tracing. In this case, the buffer is established in the 
private process space instead of the kernel space (which is the default 
behavior).


Control the level of tracing required
-------------------------------------

In order to use the following options, a provider would need to have this 
functionality enabled in code. One would therefore have to check with the 
provider (like the Operating System or the Directory service), before using 
these options. 

-level <n>
a provider could have number of levels of tracing. A higher number would 
indicate a deeper level of tracing.

-flags <n>
by supplying a flag, more specific tracing can be achieved. The flag passed 
depends on what functionality the provider has implemented.

executes

Examples
--------

1. tracelog -start
   Starts system event tracing with the log file being the default    
   c:\logfile.etl

2. tracelog -guid control.guid -start ds -f c:\mylogfile
   Here (Directory Service) ds (logger name) tracing is started with the log       
   file being mylogfile.etl

3. tracelog -start (starts system tracing)
   tracelog -start ds -guid control.guid -f c:\dslogfile.etl (starts DS 
   tracing)

4. tracelog -stop
   tracelog -stop ds

5. tracelog -start -f kernel_log.etl
   tracelog -start ds -guid control.guid -f ds_log.etl

6. tracelog -update 
   If current logger is a real-time logger, this will switch current logger to    
   non real-time, sequential logger.


TRACEDMP
--------

TraceDmp is a Data Consumer sample. It uses the Event Tracing API to read the 
.etl log files (or consume events from the log file) created by TraceLog or by 
consuming the real-time events enabled in a data provider.  TraceDmp outputs
the data in a CSV file that conveniently loads into a database or spreadsheet 
program.  A summary file is also created to show the sum of all events by each 
event type during the session time. You can use TraceDmp flags to specify only
a summary file and omit the CSV file output. 

This behaves like a WMI consumer. It takes the output from the tracelog (this
is generally a .etl file) and converts it into a user-friendly format.
Basically it helps us view the results of the events traced. Tracedmp gives us
two ways to view the data obtained from event tracing. 

Summary.txt file - As the name suggests, this gives us a summary of the events 
traced. 

CSV (comma-separated format) file - This file sorts events in chronological 
order (increasing order of the time-stamp) thus giving us a more detailed view 
for each event.


For tracedmp to work, you need to use the log file that was created by
tracelog. The log file is written in a specific format, with a header and some
variable data. This format is interpreted by tracedmp. While the header is
fixed, the variable data has to be interpreted separately for each event
(eg., process start/end tracing and disk I/O tracing have their own variable
structure). This variable portion is determined by tracedmp through a lookup
in the mofdata.guid file (which is included in the tool directory). Presently
this file contains information only for DS and System tracing. To be able to
process data from some other provider, its format would have to be included in
the file or a new file would have to be provided. The format is based on the
WMI format, which uses the MOF structure. Details could be obtained by running
WBEMTest.

Tracedmp can also be used for real time event tracing in which case the tool 
will read from the buffer itself instead of from the file. The format and 
process is similar to that described earlier for log files.



Usage: tracedmp [options] <etl file> | [-? | -h | -help]
The options are explained below:

-o <file>
specify the name of the csv  and summary file to which you would like the 
results to appear. The default files are dumpfile.csv and summary.txt and are 
placed in the tracedmp directory (see example 1).

-guid <file>
specify the file containing a list of GUID's. The default is mofdata.guid. This 
is required if tracing is done for a provider other than the DS or the
Operating System.

-rt [logger name]
use this option if real time tracing is being performed. Ensure that tracelog
is also in real time mode and set the logger file name to that provided in the 
tracelog command (see example 2).

-summary
select this option if only the summary file is required. In this case, the csv 
file is not created.

Output files
-------------

Summary.txt - This contains a count of all the events that occurred while 
tracing was being performed. The GUID's for each event are also displayed. It
is important to understand the difference between Event type - start/end and
Event type - DCstart/DCend (DC=Data Collection). The former are those event
that started and ended after tracing had begun, i.e. they had their lifetime
within the tracing period. There are however processes (or threads) that had
begun even before tracing had been turned on, and continue even after tracing
is completed. For such events, their beginning is the time tracing was turned
on and their end is the time tracing was turned off. Hence we have DCstart and
DCend.

Dumpfile.csv - This file can be opened in MSExcel. It contains a list of the 
events as they occurred in chronological order. The various fields are:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Event name         Name of the event being traced                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|TID            Thread Identifer                                             |
|Clock-time     The timestamp of the event occurrence                        |
|Kernel (ms)    Time taken by that event in the kernel space                 |
|User (ms)      Time taken by the event in the user space                    |
|User data ...  The variable portion of the header. This is                  |
|               based on the MOF structure, provided in the                  |
|               MOFdata.guid file. This could be more than                   |
|               one column of data. To be able to interpret                  |
|               it, one would have tolook at the above file,                 |
|               or run WEBMTest as explained above.                          |
|IID            Instance ID                                                  |
|PIID           Parent Instance ID (to which the IID relates)                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: IID and PIID are the last two columns (rightmost columns) of the output 
file and should not be mistaken for User Data as this field could span multiple 
columns.

Examples

Tracedmp c:\logfile.etl
Tracedmp -o myoutput c:\logfile.etl
In this case, the output files will be myoutput.csv and myoutput.txt

Tracedmp -rt ds
This assumes that the ds is being traced in real time mode using the tracelog 
command.




TRACEDP
=======
TraceDp is a Data Provider sample. It demonstrates how you can provide event 
trace data to the logger or a Data Consumer from user mode code. For a kernel 
mode driver there are kernel mode equivalent APIs. 


Usage: TraceDp [options] [number of events] [-? | -h | -help]

        -UseEventTraceHeader        This is the deafult
        -UseEventInstanceHeader
        -UseMofPtrFlag
        
 [number of events] default is 5000

- UseEventTraceHeader
Instructs Tracdp to use the EVent trace header for logging

-UseEventInstanceHeader
Instructs Tracedp to generate instance id's for subseuqent use by the tracelog 
sample.

-UseMofptrFlag
Instructs Tracedp to use the MOF ptr flag to reference the logged data 


USING THE EVENT TRACING SAMPLES
===============================

The following examples show how to use TraceLog's default settings, logging 
registry activity, and using TraceLog to control the TraceDP Data Provider 
sample.


Using the Sample's Defaults
===========================

1) Start the NT Kernel Logger by using only the -start command.  By default the 
   events are placed in the c:\LogFile.etl file.

   C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start

2) To stop the session use -stop.

   C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop


After you have started and stop a logging session you should find a file
named c:\LogFile.etl.  This files store logging events between the time
you use tracelog -start and tracelog -stop.

By default TraceLog will log information regarding processes, threads, disk,
and network I/O.

Using the NT Kernel Logger to Trace Registry Usage
==================================================

There are various details about kernel processing which is not logged by
default. You can also trace file I/O, page faults, image load information,
registry operations, and process private information. The following is an
example of retrieve trace information when creating a registry key and
adding a registry value.

1) Start the NT Kernel Logger to get Registry traces. The -cm switch stands for 
Configuration Manager, another name for Registry. Also the -noprocess, -
nothread, -nodisk, and -nonet switches are used to remove the clutter so you
can focus on the registry events.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start -noprocess -nothread -nodisk -nonet -cm

2) After starting the logging session, use the registry editor to create a key
at a location of your choice and create a string value.

3) Next, stop the logging session for the NT Kernel Logger

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop

4) Use the TraceDmp utility to dump the information to a CSV file and Summary.
Go to the tracedmp directory and run tracedmp with no arguments.  By default
it will read the C:\LogFile.Etl, use the MofData.Guid for details about
output, and produce the DumpFile.csv and Summary.txt files.  Below is an
example of the Summary.txt.

Using TraceLog to Control the TraceDp Sample
=============================================
TraceLog can be used with the TraceDp (Sample Data Provider) example to create 
an etl file. But first add the control guid to the Control.Guid file in the 
TraceLog directory.  This is used as input for TraceLog.

1) Open Control.Guid with Notepad.exe and add the following line.
   d58c126f-b309-11d1-969e-0000f875a5bc tracedp

The name at the end of the GUID is arbitrary.  The name will appear in the 
output CSV and summary text files.

2) Prepare to create a dump file by create a "mofdata.guid" file that is 
specifically for the tracedp sample.  In the tracedmp directory create a new 
file with Notepad.exe, name it "mofdp.guid" and save the following contents.


ce5b1020-8ea9-11d0-a4ec-00a0c9062910  tracedp
{
 EventInfo, ItemUlong
}


The above GUID is the Transaction Guid found in tracedp.c.

3) Start the TraceDp sample data provide.  The following is an example usage

C:\tracedp>tracedp -UseEventTraceHeader

You should see the following output:

Trace registered successfully
Testing Logger with 5000 events


3) Start the logging session and provide the Control.Guid file as input. You'll 
need to start a new command prompt.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -start tracedp -guid control.guid

Note that the name after -start is a session name and is arbitrary. At this 
point you should see the following text output with "."s printed to show 
progress:

Logging enabled to 0x0000000000000002
..........................

4) After you are satisfied with the amount of data, stop the logging session.

C:\TraceLog>tracelog -stop tracedp -guid control.guid

5) Now use TraceDmp to dump the data that was logged.  Here you use the 
mofdp.guid file
that you created in step 2 above.

C:\TraceDmp>tracedmp -guid mofdp.guid

The following is an example the of Summary.txt file that is output.

C:\Logfile.Etl

    CONSOLE APPLICATION : ConsoleCom Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this ConsoleCom application for you.  
This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your ConsoleCom application.


ConsoleCom.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

ConsoleCom.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

ConsoleCom.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named ConsoleCom.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

This is to DIFF as graphs are to columns of numbers # $ K + Invoking Windiff from the command line Command line flagsCommand_line_flags  To invoke windiff so that you can then use menus to define the comparison, just enter Windiff Windiff can be invoked with one or two paths.  The second path, defaults to the current directory.  If both paths are (or are defaulted to) directories then it compares the whole directories.  If one path is a file then it compares that file with a file of the same name in the other directory.  If both paths are files then it compares the two files.  The most common cases are as follows. To compare a file in another directory with a file of the same name in this directory enter Windiff  path_to_other_file To compare another whole directory with the current directory enter Windiff  path_to_other_directory To compare two directories (including subdirectories) enter Windiff  path_to_first_directory  path_to_second_directory To compare two files Windiff  path_to_first_file   path_to_second_file # $ K + Command line flags Anywhere in the command line you can include any of the following to modify the behaviour of windiff -D to compare one directory only (i.e. ignore subdirectories) -O to force it to stay in outline mode.  The default is to expand single file comparisons.  This is useful for comparing very large files or binary files where the expansion can take a long time and is not very meaningful. -N name to do a NET  SEND to name to announce the end of the comparison.  This can be useful for very long comparisons involving thousands of files.  -S <saveopts> savefile to save the results of the comparison to savefile.  This saves the outline mode list.  This is only really useful for comparing directories. <saveopts> are any combination of  s to include files that are the same in both directories l to include files that are only in the left hand (i.e. first) directory r to include files that are only in the right hand (i.e. second) directory d to include files that are different in the two directories x to exit after the results have been saved. -? to give immediate, context sensitive, syntax help for these command line flags (always worth a try) You can use "/" instead of "-" to prefix flags and it means the same. # $ K + Expanded mode display Colours Red background means left hand file.   Yellow background means right hand file. If Windiff was invoked as Windiff other_directory then red means the other_directory and yellow means the current directory. White background means common to both files Blue text means that the line is moved text Black text means text that is the identical (white background) or different (coloured background). Green text means that windiff thinks that there is a corresponding similar line in the other file (see Zebra StripesZebra_Stripes) # $ K + File menu Compare files  leads to a file open dialog for each of two files to be compared Compare directories leads to dialog to allow entry of two directory names for comparison Abort will be greyed unless an operation is in progress.  Then allows that operation to be terminated before completion.  When this is not greyed, there is also an Abort button at the top right of the window which has the same function. Save File List allows the list of files which are (the same, different, only in left  or only in right) to be saved.  In addition, a checksum for each file can be saved. Copy Files  leads to a dialog allowing you to write the files to a disk.  This can be useful if you are trying to synchronise two directories. Print prints the current view (either outline or expanded) # $ K + Edit Menu Edit left file invokes an editor (the default is notepad) on the left hand file.  After editing the file is recompared. Edit right file invokes an editor (the default is notepad) on the right hand file.  After editing the file is recompared. Edit composite file invokes an editor (the default is notepad) on a file which is constructed to be a composite of the two files.  The first four columns of this file indicate the comparison status of each line. as follows: !>  The line occurs in the right hand file <!  The line occurs in the left hand file <-  The line has been moved.  This shows its position in the left hand file ->  The line has been moved.  This shows the position in the right hand file.     (four blanks) indicates the line was the same in the two files.  (white space may differ if the options allow that) After editing the file is recompared. Set editor allows you to select the editor of your choice by specifying a command line.  The string "%p" will be replaced by the name of the file to be edited and the string "%l" will be replaced by the line number.  The default is to invoke notepad with the line "notepad %p"  If you use the slick editor you might want to use "s %p -#%l" # $ K + View menu Outline showa the list of files with the status of each Expand shows the detailed comparison of the selected file Picture shows the comparison pictorially at the left (turning the picture off saves screen real estate). Previous Change (F7) skips backwards to the previous point of difference between the files or in outline mode to the previous file with status "different" Next change (F8) skips forwards to the next point of difference between the files or in outline mode to the next file with status "different" Rescan selected file recompares the selected file.  If a file is unreadable for some reason (e.g. access denied because opened with DENY_READ by another process) then this allows you to try again for that file.  This can be useful for tidying up loose ends, especially when doing large comparisons involving thousands of files. # $ K + Expand menu Left file only shows only lines from left hand file (but coloured so as to highlight changed lines) Right file only shows only lines from right hand file (but coloured so as to highlight changed lines) Both files (default) shows a merge of both files. All the lines in the left hand file are shown in the order in which they occur in that file, likewise for the right hand file.  Moved lines occur twice, once in the position of the line in the left hand file, once in the position for the right hand file. Left line numbers causes line numbers to be shown, based on the left hand file Right line numbers causes line numbers to be shown, based on the right hand file No line numbers turns line numbers off.  This saves some screen real estate. # $ K + Options menu Ignore blanks causes white space characters (space, tab, newline) to be ignored in the expanded view, so that lines which differ only in white space are shjown as identical. Mono colours uses colours suitable for a monochrome display. The next four options control which files (if any) are displayed in outline mode. Show Identical Files Include files which are identical in each path Show Left-Only Files Include files which occur only in the left hand path Show Right-Only Files Include files which occur only in the right hand path Show Different Files Include files which occur in both paths, but which are not the same. # $ K + Mark menu Marks are used to allow particular files to be included or excluded from the comparison Mark file marks the selected file Mark pattern  leads to a dialog which allows you to specify a substring or a regular expression and have all the files that match this pattern marked. "$" means "end of string" "\\" means "\" "\." means "."   Thus to mark all files with extension "obj" the expression should be "\.obj$". Hide marked files removes from the displayed list all the marked files (and any future file as it becomes marked) Toggle mark state marks all unmarked files and unmarks all marked files.  If you want to select the files that you wish to see, mark them, hide marked files (they will disappear) and toggle the mark state (they will reappear and the rest will disappear). # $ K + Zebra Stripes After matching such parts of the file that it can match, Windiff looks at the remaining parts.  Where there are sections which are different, but which correspond, in the sense that the part before and the part after match between the files, windiff has a choice between displaying the lines as blocks e.g.  EMBED Word.Picture.6   or interleaved. e.g.  EMBED Word.Picture.6   Windiff uses a heuristic to judge whether the lines from the two files are similar or not.  If it judges that they are similar it displays them interleaved, otherwise it displays them as blocks.  The heuristic is quick to execute rather than sophisticated and slow.  Sometimes one would wish that it had made the opposite choice. # IDH_CONTENTS $ Contents K Contents + WINDIFF # Invoking_Windiff_from_the_command_line $ Invoking Windiff from the command line K Invoking Windiff from the command line + WINDIFF # Command_line_flags $ Command line flags K Command line flags + WINDIFF # Expanded_mode_display $ Expanded mode display K Expanded mode display + WINDIFF # File_menu $ File menu K File menu + WINDIFF # Edit_Menu $ Edit Menu K Edit Menu + WINDIFF # View_menu $ View menu K View menu + WINDIFF # Expand_menu $ Expand menu K Expand menu + WINDIFF # Options_menu $ Options menu K Options menu + WINDIFF # Mark_menu $ Mark menu K Mark menu + WINDIFF # Zebra_Stripes $ Zebra Stripes K Zebra Stripes + WINDIFF ContentsInvoking Windiff from the command lineCommand line flagsExpanded mode displayFile menuEdit MenuView menuExpand menuOptions menuMark menu Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Heading 7 Heading 8 Heading 9 Default Paragraph Font Topic Text Topic Heading Topic Caption Topic Text Item Topic Text Indent Normal Indent Footnote Text Footnote Reference Zebra Stripes Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Heading 7 Heading 8 Heading 9 Default Paragraph Font Topic Text Topic Heading Topic Caption Topic Text Item Topic Text Indent Normal Indent Footnote Text Footnote Reference IMAGEn!

Sometimes one would wish that it had made the opposite choice. # IDH_CONTENTS $ Contents K Contents + WINDIFF # Invoking_Windiff_from_the_command_line $ Invoking Windiff from the command line K Invoking Windiff from the command line + WINDIFF # Command_line_flags $ Command line flags K Command line flags + WINDIFF # Expanded_mode_display $ Expanded mode display K Expanded mode display + WINDIFF # File_menu $ File menu K File menu + WINDIFF # Edit_Menu $ Edit Menu K Edit Menu + WINDIFF # View_menu $ View menu K View menu + WINDIFF # Expand_menu $ Expand menu K Expand menu + WINDIFF # Options_menu $ Options menu K Options menu + WINDIFF # Mark_menu $ Mark menu K Mark menu + WINDIFF # Zebra_Stripes $ Zebra Stripes K Zebra Stripes + WINDIFF Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Heading 7 Heading 8 Heading 9 Default Paragraph Font Topic Text Topic Heading Topic Caption Topic Text Item Topic Text Indent Normal Indent Footnote Text Footnote Reference ANCHOR TITLE IMAGE Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.RTF Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.RTF Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC Alistair Banks!E:\SOURCE\HLP\WINDIFF\WINDIFF.DOC @\\HAMBLE\pscript Ne00: winspool \\HAMBLE\pscript PRIV   N N N \\HAMBLE\pscript PRIV   N N N Times New Roman Symbol Arial CG Times (WN) (C:\WINAPPS\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\ROBOHELP.DOT # $ K + Contents Alistair Banks Alistair Banks

MOST COMMON USAGE:
1  WINDIFF -L                  for SLM
2  WINDIFF path_to_other_file  to compare other_file with current dir file
3  WINDIFF                     and use the menus

It compares directories or files giving a graphic comparison.
This is to DIFF as graphs are to columns of numbers!

Full command line syntax:

WINDIFF [-R sumserver] [paths] [saveoption]

where [foo] means foo is optional, can leave it off.

paths =  path
                to compare what's at path with what's in the current directory
      or path1 path2
                to compare what's at path1 with what's at path2
      or -L
                to compare SLM library with current (enlisted) directory
      or -L file
                to compare SLM library file with file

      path can always be relative or absolute, net or local, file or directory.

sumserver is the name of a machine running SUMSERVE.EXE.  This is used for
          high-speed compares across a slow net.  It runs as a distributed
          application with intelligence on both ends of the slow link.

saveoption = -s slrd savefile
             where slrd is any combination of these four letters to write the
             names of files that are
                 s the same in both paths
                 l only in the left hand path
                 r only in the right hand path
                 d in both paths, but the two files are different


Colours (sic, it was written by a couple of Brits)
    RED background means LEFT FILE
    YELLOW background means RIGHT FILE

    blue text = moved line
    black text = everything else

    For WINDIFF -L RED    = SLM
                   YELLOW = current directory




File menu
    Compare files...
        Leads to a file open dialog for each of two files to be compared
    Compare directories
        Leads to dialog to allow entry of two directory names for comparison
    Compare remote...
        Leads to a dialog to allow entry of two paths and a remote sumserver
    Close
        Beats me!
    Abort
        Will be greyed unless an operation is in progress.  Then allows
        that operation to be terminated before completion.
    Save File List
        Allows the list of files which are (the same, different, only in left
        or only in right) to be saved.  In addition, a checksum for each file
        can be saved.  (Useful if the net is on the fritz).
    Copy Files...
        Leads to a dialog allowing you to write the files to a disk.
        For a remote compare this will compress the files before sending
        them across the network, thereby saving time.
    Print
        Beats me!

        Show only lines from right hand file (but coloured so as to highlight
        changed lines)
    Both files (default)
        Show a merge of both files. All the lines in the left hand file are
        shown in the order in which they occur in that file, likewise for
        the right hand file.  Lines which are ONLY in the left hand file
        are shown in red.  Lines which are ONLY in the right hand file
        are shown in yellow.
    Left line numbers
        Line numbers are shown, based on the left hand file

    No line numbers
        Line numbers are turned off.

Options menu
    Ignore blanks
        Blanks are ignored in the expanded view, so that lines which
        differ only in white space are shjown as identical

    The next four options control which files (if any) are displayed in
    outline mode.

    Show Identical Files

the lines from the two files are similar or not.  If it judges that they are similar it displays them interlea ved, otherwise it displays them as blocks.  The heuristic is quick to execute rather than sophisticated and slow.

The name of this task is based on the user\rquote s name, for example, \'93John Doe\rquote s Desktop Cleanup Monitor\'94. For the case of different user on different domains having the same user name, we append the user account\rquote  s guid to the task name. \par \tab This task  is scheduled to run daily, but only if the user is logged on. When this task runs, the first thing it does is that it checks the last run time and finds out how many days its supposed to wait between cleanup (default 60 days, can be overridden by policy)   If those many days have elapsed since it last ran it launches the cleanup process. (The point of the task running daily is that if an administrator changes the policy value, we pick it up within a day, instead of waiting till the wizard runs, which coul d be as many as 60 days). \par \tab The cleanup process first finds out if there are any unused items on the desktops, by definition, unused items are items that have not been used since the wizard last ran. If there are no such items, it just records the last run a nd ends. Otherwise, it pops up a notification balloon. The balloon shows up three times, for 10 seconds each with 15 seconds interval in between. If the user does not click on it, we just log the last run time and finish. If the user clicks on the notific ation, the wizard UI shows up, and guides the user through as per the specs. \par  \par \tab The only items we consider while cleaning up are shortcuts (which support IShellLink interface) and regitems. There is code in defview that tracks this usage, so we have accurate last used times. For shortcuts, we simply move the file  to the Unused Desktop Files folder, which the user can drag back if he wants to restore it. We have a slightly complicated procedure for handling regitems, which is explained below. \par  \par }{\b Cleaning Up Regitems}{:  \par \tab A regitem is an icon that you see on the desktop because of some settings added to the registry. There is no physical file  in the desktop folder for that item. As these kind of regitems can only be created in special registry folders like the desktop folders, there is no way to create them in the Unused Desktop Files folder, which is a normal file system folder. So what we do  is that we create a file in Unused Desktop Files folder which has a filename \'93Name.\{CLSID\}\'94, where the CLSID is the CLSID of the registry item. For example, for outlook we will create a file called \'93Microsoft Outlook. \{ 00020D75-0000-0000-C000-000000000046\}\'94. The cool thing about these }{\b\fs20 .\{CLSID\}}{  files is that shell treats this objects as special and makes them behave same as the corresponding regitem. So this file will have the same icon and all the right click menu options of the corresponding regitem on the  desktop. So, we create this file and mark the regitem as hidden on the desktop. So as far as the user is concerned he just moved this item to the Unused Desktop Filse folder. \par \tab However, this file is not quite the same thing as the regitem, as it has some extra options on the right click menu. So in case the user restores this file from the Unused folder and puts it back on th e desktop, we try to restore the regitem when we get a chance. What we do is that whenever the wizard runs, while enumerating all the items on the desktop it actually checks if there is a }{\b\fs20 .\{CLSID}{\} file on the desktop.  Then it verifies if there is a regitem on the desktop for the CLSID that has been marked as hidden. And then if both the file and the regitem have the same display name, we delete the file and re-enable the regitem. \par \tab Also, because we do not track usage of the }{\b\fs20 .\{CLSID\}}{ files on the desktop (we potentially could), when we re-enable the regitem we mark it as having been used at that time so that it is not cleaned up again immediately. \par \tab Confused? Please ping me, and I\rquote ll explain it to you. \par \tab  \par - Arish Ali (10/18/00). \par  \par  \par }}

2.0 Alpha Issues:
a) This requires the version number to be set unless you have an alpha version of lsv.exe.  comc95.dll can be a stub text file to keep the package small.

3.0 International Issues:
a) You need an IExpress and related DLLs in the language you plan to localize in.  For example, you need Hebrew iexpress and DLLs in \redist\he\ and you need to use that IExpress for the License dialog to be localized in that language.
b) The localizers send the license in a Word document.  This needs to be saved to a text file on a machine supporting that language or the DBCS text file will be in the wrong code page.

*	If you have multiple validly licensed copies of the applicable OS Product(s), you may reproduce, install, and use one copy of the Operating System Components as part of such applicable OS Product(s) on all of your computers running validly licensed copies of the OS Product(s) provided that you use such additional copies of the Operating System Components in accordance with the terms and conditions above. For each validly licensed copy of the applicable OS Product, you also may reproduce one additional copy of the Operating System Components solely for archival purposes or reinstallation of the Operating System Components on the same computer as the Operating System Components were previously installed.  Microsoft retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Operating System Components.  All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft.

*	The OS Components may contain technology that enables applications to be shared between two or more computers, even if an application is installed on only one of the computers.  You may use this technology with all Microsoft application products for multi-party conferences.  For non-Microsoft applications, you should consult the accompanying license agreement or contact the licensor to determine whether application sharing is permitted by the licensor.

Note on Java Support.  The OS Components may contain support for programs written in Java.  Java technology is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of Java technology could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Sun Microsystems, Inc. has contractually obligated Microsoft to make this disclaimer.

*	Subject to the distribution requirements described below, if you obtain the OS Components on a CD-ROM from Microsoft, you may redistribute sp5i386.exe, sp5alpha.exe, sp5symi.exe and sp5syma.exe separately or together (collectively "Redistributable Code").  You must verify that you are distributing the most recent version of the Redistributable Code.  Check the Microsoft FTP server at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/ for the latest version.  If you find a more recent version of the Microsoft FTP server, you may download such files for your own use; provided, however, you may not redistribute any such files without first obtaining them on a CD-ROM from Microsoft.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIRMENTS:  Microsoft grants you the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, right and license to reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Redistributable Code either for use in conjunction with your computer hardware product or with your own software product, designed to operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows NT, provided: (a) each copy of the Redistributable Code is a true and complete copy made directly from the Microsoft CD-ROM; (b) you require any installation of the Redistributable Code to be made by running the self-extracting executable file or files; (c) you distribute the readme.txt file and \drvlib directory along with and in the same directory as any individual or group of Redistributable Code you distribute; (d) you distribute your own software product containing the Redistributable Code on a CD-ROM and pursuant to an End-User License Agreement with terms no less protective than those contained in the applicable OS Product EULA.  Your End-User License Agreement may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed; (e) you include all copyright and trademark notices contained in the Redistributable Code; (f) you do not distribute the Redistributable Code for profit; (g) you do not modify the Redistributable Code; and (h) you do not permit further redistribution of the Redistributable Code.

Export Restrictions.

You agree that you will not export or re-export the OS Componenets to any country, person, or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export the OS Components: (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed or restricted the export of goods or services, which as of March 1999 include, but are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who intends to transmit or transport the OS Components back to such country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know will utilize the OS Components or portion thereof in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and represent that neither the BXA nor any other U.S. federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges. For additional information see http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/.

Redistributable Code is a subset of the OS Components and is subject to the same Export Restrictions.

IF THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT WAS LICENSED TO YOU BY MICROSOFT OR ANY OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, THE LIMITED WARRANTY (IF ANY) INCLUDED IN THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT EULA APPLIES TO THE OS COMPONENTS PROVIDED THE OS COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY YOU WITHIN THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT EULA.  HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA DOES NOT EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH THE LIMITED WARRANTY IS PROVIDED.

IF THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT WAS LICENSED TO YOU BY AN ENTITY OTHER THAN MICROSOFT OR ANY OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, MICROSOFT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE OS COMPONENT AS FOLLOWS:

DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTIES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE TO YOU THE OS COMPONENTS, AND ANY (IF ANY) SUPPORT SERVICES RELATED TO THE OS COMPONENTS ("SUPPORT SERVICES") AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS; AND MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM WITH RESPECT TO THE OS COMPONENTS AND SUPPORT SERVICES ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY (IF ANY) WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF OR RELATED TO:  TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, LACK OF VIRUSES, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF RESPONSES, RESULTS, LACK OF NEGLIGENCE OR LACK OF WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION, AND CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION.  THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND ANY SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS WITH YOU.

EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR:  LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY, FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY (INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE), NEGLIGENCE, AND ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE OS COMPONENTS OR THE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA, EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. NOT WITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED ABOVE AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MICROSOFT AND ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE OPERATING SYSTEM COMPONENTS OR U.S.$5.00.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SUPPLEMENTAL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE

IMPORTANT:  READ CAREFULLY - These Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") operating system components, including any "online" or electronic documentation ("OS Components") are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement under which you have licensed the applicable Microsoft operating system product ("OS Product") described below (each an "End User License Agreement" or "EULA") and the terms and conditions of this Supplemental EULA.  BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE OS COMPONENTS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT EULA AND THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, OR USE THE OS COMPONENTS.

NOTE:  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID EULA FOR ANY "OS PRODUCT" (MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95, MICROSOFT WINDOWS 98, MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION 4.0, MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0, MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT SERVER, ENTERPRISE EDITION 4.0 OR MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0, TERMINAL SERVER EDITION), YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL, COPY, OR OTHERWISE USE THE OS COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.

Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental EULA and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable OS Product EULA.

General.  The OS Components are provided to you by Microsoft to update, supplement, or replace existing functionality of the applicable OS Product.  In the event your OS Product is a version of Windows NT Server, the OS Components are deemed "Client Software." Microsoft grants you a license to use the OS Components under the terms and conditions of the OS Product EULA for the applicable OS Product (which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the terms and conditions set forth in this Supplemental EULA, provided that you comply with all such terms and conditions.  To the extent that any terms in this Supplemental EULA conflict with terms in the applicable OS Product EULA, the terms of this Supplemental EULA control solely with respect to the OS Components.

Additional Rights and Limitations.  

*	If you have multiple validly licensed copies of the applicable OS Product(s), you may reproduce, install, and use one copy of the Operating System Components as part of such applicable OS Product(s) on all of your computers running validly licensed copies of the OS Product(s) provided that you use such additional copies of the Operating System Components in accordance with the terms and conditions above. For each validly licensed copy of the applicable OS Product, you also may reproduce one additional copy of the Operating System Components solely for archival purposes or reinstallation of the Operating System Components on the same computer as the Operating System Components were previously installed.  Microsoft retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Operating System Components.  All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft.

*	The OS Components may contain technology that enables applications to be shared between two or more computers, even if an application is installed on only one of the computers.  You may use this technology with all Microsoft application products for multi-party conferences.  For non-Microsoft applications, you should consult the accompanying license agreement or contact the licensor to determine whether application sharing is permitted by the licensor.

Note on Java Support.  The OS Components may contain support for programs written in Java.  Java technology is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of Java technology could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Sun Microsystems, Inc. has contractually obligated Microsoft to make this disclaimer.

*	Subject to the distribution requirements described below, if you obtain the OS Components on a CD-ROM from Microsoft, you may redistribute sp5i386.exe, sp5alpha.exe, sp5symi.exe and sp5syma.exe separately or together (collectively "Redistributable Code").  You must verify that you are distributing the most recent version of the Redistributable Code.  Check the Microsoft FTP server at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/ for the latest version.  If you find a more recent version of the Microsoft FTP server, you may download such files for your own use; provided, however, you may not redistribute any such files without first obtaining them on a CD-ROM from Microsoft.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIRMENTS:  Microsoft grants you the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, right and license to reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Redistributable Code either for use in conjunction with your computer hardware product or with your own software product, designed to operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows NT, provided: (a) each copy of the Redistributable Code is a true and complete copy made directly from the Microsoft CD-ROM; (b) you require any installation of the Redistributable Code to be made by running the self-extracting executable file or files; (c) you distribute the readme.txt file and \drvlib directory along with and in the same directory as any individual or group of Redistributable Code you distribute; (d) you distribute your own software product containing the Redistributable Code on a CD-ROM and pursuant to an End-User License Agreement with terms no less protective than those contained in the applicable OS Product EULA.  Your End-User License Agreement may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed; (e) you include all copyright and trademark notices contained in the Redistributable Code; (f) you do not distribute the Redistributable Code for profit; (g) you do not modify the Redistributable Code; and (h) you do not permit further redistribution of the Redistributable Code.

// Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time dates.  Also included is some
// explanatory text for the BINARY values stored under the TZI key.
// These values correspond to the similar values in the Windows NT
// TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION structure and its included SYSTEMTIME structures.
// Each of the BIAS values are LONGs and each element in the Dates is

// Under the "Time Zones" key - each key name is the Standard Time Zone
// name.   Under that the "Display" value is the string displayed in the
// Listbox that the User sees.  The "Dlt" value is the Daylight Time Zone
// name.  Both the Standard and Daylight Time Zone names cannot exceed 32
// chars in length because they are the strings used in the TIME_ZONE_
// INFORMATION structure.

==============================
Date/Time Control Panel
==============================







==============================
Internet Time Tab
==============================

DESCRIPTION:
===============
The internet time section of the Date/Time control panel is made up of several parts:

timedate.cpl:
The CPL will allow users to change settings which are stored in the registry.  The W32Time service is then sent notifications that settings changed.
The settings are per-machine so only admins can modify this UI.  d


W32Time.dll: (NT Service)
The service will then sync at the appropriate time to the appropriate place (DC Time Server vs. internet NTP server).

time.windows.com: (WindowsUpdate service)
Our team


BEHAVIOR:
===============
Specs:
    General: http://neptune/arch/gen/AutoSetTimeDate.htm
    Server Deployment: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1769.html
    NTP: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1769.html


// This key determins how often we sync from the internet NTP server.  Not applicable to DC time servers.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer, "SpecialPollInterval", REG_DWORD = 604800 (1 once per day)

// This key determins if we try DC time server, internet time servers, or both.  AllSync is both.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters, "Type", REG_SZ = "AllSync"

// This key is used by the service to determine the server(s) to get the internet time from:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer, "NtpServer", REG_SZ = "time.windows.com,0x3"


TOP QUESTIONS:
===============
Q: Why is the "Internet Time" hidden sometimes?
A: This tab will not modify the behavior when time comes from the admin controled DC time server.  I hide the tab if:
   1. The machine is joined to a domain, AND
   2. We search the domain and find a domain control that will act as a time server

Q: Why is the UI grayed out?
A: You need admin privilages to modify these values.

Q: Will this work with Personal FireWall or other NAT based Firewalls?
A: Yes.

Q: Will this work with other popular firewalls (CERN/web proxies, routers that block addresses).
A: No, most firewalls will block NTP's UDP packets on port 123.  Admins can open these ports if they want, but almost never do.

Q: Why is there a small pause before the "Internet Time" tab appears.
A: We need to search the domain for a DC that will provide the time.  This takes a few seconds on a large corp net, like Microsoft.
   We need to do this because we may need to keep the tab hidden.  Some laptops will be joined to a domain and plug and un-plug from
   the corp net.  We need the CPL to display the tab in the right cases, so we need to do a search each time.  This won't block
   the UI thread.

Q: Will this work with other popular firewalls (CERN/web proxies, routers that block addresses).
A: No, most firewalls will block NTP's UDP packets on port 123.  Admins can open these ports if they want, but almost never do.

Q: How can I force the time to sync now?
A: In a cmd.exe window, do the following commands:
   1. net stop W32time
   2. net start W32time

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSCPIN.EXE - Description

This utility is intended to supplement the "administratively assigned offline 
files" policy shipped for Offline Files in Windows 2000.  This policy is 
accessed through the following paths in the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).

1. Computer Config\Admin Templates\Windows Components\Network\Offline Files

2. User Config\Admin Templates\Windows Components\Network\Offline Files


First, what is administrative pinning (aka admin pinning) and why do
we need this utility?

This is a feature by which administrators can designate one or more files
or folders to always be available offline.  Currently in Windows 2000 this
is performed through system policy as described above.  However, there are
some known problems with the Windows 2000 implementation that occur when
multiple people are sharing a computer and admin-pinning is specified in
user policy.  The way the implementation was designed, only the intesection
of the set of files admin-pinned for all users remains pinned.  When user
policy is applied for any one user, all admin-pinned files NOT listed in that 
user's policy will be unpinned and removed from the cache.

Another significant problem with admin pinning in Windows 2000 is that it
is performed silently whenever policy is applied (without progress UI) on 
a background thread in explorer.exe.   Therefore, there is no way, other 
than the disk activity indicator, to determine when the operation is complete.

These issues will be addressed in future versions of Windows.  cscpin.exe
was created to to provide an interim solution.

cscpin runs as a console application, displaying it's output to
either the console or to a log file.  This allows the operator to know
exactly when the operation starts and finishes.



                 **************************************
                 *          IMPORTANT NOTE            *
                 **************************************

    cscpin will not run if the admin-pin policy is active.  This is to 
    prevent unwanted interactions between the existing policy code and 
    cscpin.  The admin-pin policy must be either "not configured" or 
    "disabled" prior to using cscpin.  It is recommended that either 
    policy or cscpin be used for admin-pinning of files, but not both.



cscpin offers several options through the command line as follows:


cscpin [<filename> | -F <listfile>] [-P | -U] [-V] [-L <logfile>]


All options may be specified in upper or lower case and may be preceeded
by either a dash ' - ' or slash ' / ' character.

Typing "cscpin" with no options displays a usage description.


<filename>  

    This is the name of a single file or directory to be
    pinned or unpinned.  The -P or -U option controls which operation
    is performed.  A single <filename> cannot be specified if the -F
    option is provided.

-F <listfile> 

    This option allows you to provide a list of files and
    directories in a separate file.  The file uses the standard Windows
    INI file format with the following sections.

    [Default] - Files and folders listed in this section will be
        pinned or unpinned according to the -P or -U option provided
        on the command line.  In the absence of -P or -U, the files
        will be unpinned.

    [Pin] - Files and folders listed in this section will be pinned.

    [Unpin] - Files and folders listed in this section will be unpinned.

    File paths may include embedded environment variable strings.
    File paths must be either UNC paths or paths containing a local drive
        letter mapped to a remote UNC path.
    File paths must be appended with a '=' character.

    Examples:

    [Pin]
    \\server\share\dir1\dir2\file=
    \\server\share\dir1\dir3=
    \\server\share\%username%=

    [Unpin]
    H:%username%=              ; Where H is mapped to a remote UNC path.


-P  

    Sets the "default" action to pin files.  Any file specified as
    <filename> and any file listed in the [Default] section of the 
    <listfile> will be pinned.  Only one of -P and -U can be specified.

-U 

    Sets the "default" action to unpin files.  Any file specified as
    <filename> and any file listed in the [Default] section of the 
    <listfile> will be unpinned.  Only one of -U and -P can be specified.

-V

    Turns on verbose output.  By default, output is minimal with only
    significan progress indications and error messages being displayed.
    Verbose output displays messages for each file as they are pinned
    and unpinned.

-L

    Redirects all output to the file specified in <logfile>.  If this
    file cannot be created, output is automatically redirected to 
    the console.  By default, output is directed to the console.



The program will return one of the following exit codes to the cmd
interpreter.


    0 means everything completed without error.
    < 0 means something went wrong and application did not complete.
    > 0 means application completed but not all items were processed.

    -6   Admin-pin policy is active
    -5   Insufficient memory
    -4   CSC not enabled
    -3   Can't find or open listfile
    -2   Single file (<filename>) not found
    -1   Invalid argument on cmd line
     0   Success
     1   Application aborted by user (ctrl-C, ctrl-Break, logoff etc)
     2   One or more CSC errors occured.  See log output.

05/15/2001  06:57 PM           116,736 IO.SYS      <-- should be system, readonly, hidden when copied to the floppy

To prepare the disk image for the DOS boot disk, create a system disk on a Win9X Machine so that the boot sector is created properly.

Then copy these files over, setting the appropriate attributes. (the attributes are called out in the list above)

Finally, use the imgtool.exe tool to create a disk image from the floppy.  Typically this will be something like

imgtool.exe \\.\a: c:\myimage.bin

FTP Folders Features:
Login As dialog.  Previously the username and password needed to be encoded in the URL.
Drag & Drop for upload and download.
Delete files and folders.
Rename files and folders
Shell Folder UI
UTF8 support so unicode filenames work on supported servers.
Password saving in a secure cache.
Open files from FTP servers via the File.Open dialog.

Internationalization:
a-bechen is the test owner for the international aspects of FTP Folders.  She will triage bugs that come in to determine if they are real bugs or reports of mis-matched code pages.

Because the File Transfer Protocol didn't specify the meaning of the high bit being set in ANSI, the high bit has been used for DBCS encoded strings. This has the limitation that only ANSI characters can be used across FTP unless they are in DBCS and the code page of the filename chars and the default code page of both the client and server match. See RFC 959: (http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/Orig/rfc959.txt)

FTP Folders implements UTF8 filenames if it is also supported by the server. This is negociated using the FEAT command with the UTF8 option. See Draft-ietf-ftpext-intl-ftp-06: Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol (href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ftpext-intl-ftp-06.txt) There are no production servers that support this that I know of. ftp://hunterh1:21000/ is our in house test server. This will support anything that is supported over UTF8 with very few limitations.


Web Proxies:
Web Proxies must have been designed by in hell because it will explicitly kill pretty much every protocol except for HTTP.  This has caused an increadible about of pain for admins trying to use any kind of rich client.  This include FTP, H.323 (NetMeeting), BuddyList, SNTP (Time Server), NNTP (NewsGroups), POP3 & SMTP (Mail), internet radio, and many many more.
If the admin want the features of FTP Folders (upload, rename, delete, good UI, recursive operations, etc.) to work, they need to either:
Explicitely turn on port 21 & 20 in their web proxy,
Install Microsoft Remote WinSock, if they use MS Proxy,
Setup a FTP Gateway (like ftp-gw), or
use Socks. I think wininet will do FTP thru socks.

If they don't need the FTP Folder features, then they can disable FTP Folders using "Use Web Based FTP".
NT #406423: IE 5.5 has a fix to one problem that caused a timeout in some network configurations. If pre-IE 5.5 users have a problem, you can tell them to unregister the DLL. It's an optional component so they can just remove that package when they use the IEAK to customize the installer for their corp.
IE #91172: We found another bug in wininet where if the internal DNS server returns IP addresses for external server names, wininet would time out. Sometimes it would navigate correctly after the time out and sometimes it wouldn't. The wininet guys couldn't fix that issue so the corp needs to work around it.

By Design Areas:
International Filenames: FTP in general only supports non-ansi filename characters if the server's default codepage matches the clients default codepage and that matches the codepage used in the filename characters.  Unless the server supports the FTP OPTS UTF8 command, in which case, full unicode is supported.  No current servers except for an internal test FTP server exist that support this.  RFC is on http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ftpext-intl-ftp-06.txt.  (NT #315357, 352306)
Security: FTP is not a secure protocol since passwords are sent in plaintext over the wire.  The browser has never offered any kind of password hiding so passwords have always been visible in the history, addressbar, MRU, statusbar, in the browser's URL, and other places.  FTP Folders will hide the password if the user entered the password into our dialog.  URLMON and the browser decided to not support this functionality so there are times when the use will see the password hidden when in FTP Folders but the password will start to appear in the browser when URLMON and the browser are used.  The most common scenario for this is to login into a server using FTP Folders, after navigating directories double click on a file to have URLMON open it.  URLMON will then put the full URL (including password) in the statusbar.  Since FTP isn't secure, the goal is to hide the password from people sitting over the sholder of the user.  Currently, we only support that functionality in FTP Folders which solves the most common case.  (NT #386165, IE #84543)
Virtual Roots: The path section of the URL is relative to the user's Virtual Root, which is complient with RFC 1738 Section 3.2.2 (ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1738.txt), which was tracked as NT #294141.  Not being able to escape the '/' to force the paths to be relative to the root is not supported. See NT #370810.
SaveAs: FTP Folders doesn't support File.SaveAs. (NT #353720)
Drag & Drop FTP to FTP: FTP Folders does not support being both the Source and the Dest. (NT 177263)
We don't use the path if we need to redirect because the user needs to change the username or password during navigation.  (NT #345900, 353883, 345792, 336863, )
UNIX softlinks: are ignored during Drag & Drop in order to break cycles.  (NT #305593)
File.CreateShortcut doesn't work:  We don't support this feature but we can't turn off the File Menu item because we need to support SFGAO_CANLINK for other reasons.  See NT #342110.

Here is the format for an FTP URL:
----------------------------------
ftp://<UserName>:<Password>@<ServerName>:<PortNum>/<Dir1>/...<SubDirs>/<FileName.txt>:type=<a|b>

UserName - [Optional] On WinNT, this can include "domain\username" and the '\' is entered as "%5c" in escaped form to get past the URL format.
Password - [Optional] Obvious.  Later I will handle displaying a dialog to enter the password when it wasn't given in the url.
Server - [Required] Intranet Machine Name, Internet DNS Name, or IP addr.
Port - [Optional] Defaults to 21.  You can test by changing IIS.
SubDir - [Optional] Needs to end in a '/' or I assume it's a file. (Hitting the server is too expensive)  
	Having a file extension will affect this.  This is always relative to the Virtual Root directory 
	if the server has a Virtual Root for that user.  If you log into bryanst2 with bryanst2\JoeMama, 
	your virtual Dir is (\user\JoeMama\).  ftp://bryanst2%5cJoeMama:pass@bryanst2/SubDir1/ will be 
	/user/JoeMama/SubDir1/ on the server.  Original IE makes all SubDirs in the URL ralative to the
	base (not Virtual Root), so these are incompatible.  I use the new way, because that follows the
	FTP spec.  This is why I have "Correct Url" and "Incorrect Url" in the test web pages.  You will
	find that IE4's original FTP support works correctly with URL w/o files (i.e. Directories).

	Virtual Root = /Users/Sales/User1/
	File /Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/file.txt
	New FTP File URL: ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/SubDir1/file.txt
	New FTP Dir URL:  ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/SubDir1/
	IE4 FTP File URL: ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/file.txt
	IE4 FTP Dir URL:  ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/

FileName - [Optional] Test files with and w/o extensions.
Type - [Optional] A mean download in ASCII.  The other is either B[inary] or I[mage], which means download in binary.  Right now, I only support B, but I may also may be needed.


Test Areas:
===========
1. Drag & Drop
-------------------
1.1 Successful single file, single folder, files and folders, files and folders recursively.
1.2 Use Copy/Paste instead of Drag/Drop.
1.3 Use these as Drop Targets: Email message, File System Folder, Ftp Folder on Same Server (SubDir), Ftp Folder
        on another server, Internet Explorer (can display dropped html file), Name Space Extensions (like Fonts Folder,
        ActiveX Control Cache, WinZip).
1.4 Use the following as Drag Sources: Email Message, Internet Shortcuts on web page, gif from web page w/o HREF,
    file system folder, UNC path, from my computer, brief case, recycle bin, WordPad (drag a scrap to an FTP Site).

1.5 Error cases: Dest Dir Full, No Write, Full of connections, Proxy blocks action.
1.6 Test using Exchange or similar drag target or drag source that doesn't use a file system for storage. (Outlook Express, Eudora?)


2. Platforms
-------------------
2.1 Win95 w/IE 5 (Bld 201 or Newer) - Browser Only

2.5 WinNT 4 w/IE 5 (Bld 201 or Newer) - Shell Integration
2.6 WinNT 5 w/IE 5 (Bld 201 or Newer) - Shell Integration

// TonyCi will have someone test the following
2.10 Win95 w/IE 4 - Browser Only
2.11 WinNT 4 w/IE 4 - Browser Only
2.12 WinNT 5 w/IE 4 - Browser Only

3.2 WinNT IIS
3.2.1 Virtual Root w/Domain
3.1 Server Name Limitations vary from Server to server.
    From: raymondc@microsoft.com (Raymond Chen)

    Subject: The great thing about standards...
    RFC959, the spec for FTP, says that the response to the "SYST" command must be
    a string whose first token is on the list of operating systems maintained by the
    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (i.e., the people who are authorized to do
    these sorts of things). Now, one of the official "operating systems" is called
    WIN32, which means that "this FTP site follows WIN32 long file name semantics".
    Not to be confused with "MSDOS", which means "FAT semantics", or "UNIX" which
    means "case-sensitive, arbitrary length, only slashes disallowed" or "UNIX-BSD"
    which means "case-sensitive, maximum 14 characters, only slashes disallowed",
    or "TOPS20" which means "God help you".  If you ask ftp.microsoft.com what
    operating system it is using, it reports "Windows_NT" instead of "WIN32". 
    I go down the list of "official" operating systems, find that "Windows_NT"
    isn't on the list, and assert "Unrecognized operating system on the other
    end; assuming UNIX".  And then I think that the guy on the other side uses
    case-sensitive filenames and get confused when it doesn't...  That's the
    great thing about standards. By ignoring them, you make it impossible for
    your own developers to write stuff that uses them...

When the thunk layer changes, do this:

1) check out nconn16\i386\thunk.asm and nconn32\i386\thunk.asm
2) rebuild the thunk layer: thunk.exe -t thk NCXP.thk -o Thunk.asm
3) replace the thunk.asm files with the generated one and check back in.

IA64:
The WMSDK does not support ia64, so the shmedia.dll
functionality has been disabled for ia64. The binary
still compiles, but the call to WMCreateReader is not made.


Fake stub lib:
Currently, wmstub.lib is in a protected directory (shell\oem\binary_release\musicprp\lib). If this
directory does not exist, we fake up the one api we use from there (WMCreateReader) in fakestublib.cpp.
To build a propertly working shmedia.dll, the builder needs access to this directory.

Applications wanting to convert text data in an arbitrary codepage to a character set in another codepage without bothering to use COM interface can utilize these character set translation APIs. When an application uses this service, it is required to have knowledge about source / destination codepage to specify to the API parameters. IsConvertINetStringAvailable() An application uses this API to check if the combination of source and destination codepage can be specified to perform character set translation. It is recommended that an application checks availability of conversion service with given codepage before calling ConvertINetString(). ConvertINetString() This API performs character set conversion between given source codepage and destination codepage identifier. An application calls this typically when it wants to convert a character stream in an Internet character set to Windows code page or vise-versa. ConvertINetMultiByteToUnicode () Unlike ConverINetString(), this API translates a character stream in either Internet character set or Windows codepage always to Unicode. An application specifies only source encoding identifier. ConvertINetUnicodeToMultiByte() This API translates a character stream in Unicode (UCS2) to the specified destination codepage. The destination codepage can be any of ISO defined character encoding or Windows standard codepage, if system has a corresponding data or an engine.  Rfc1766ToLcid() / LcidToRfc1766() These APIs translate a windows locale identifier value to a human readable name that conforms RFC1766, or the RFC conforming name to lcid, respectively. This functions are equivalent to ImultiLanguage methods in the same name. IEnumCodePage interface. This is an interface basically in form of enumerator which gets a client an array of MIMECPINFO structure. A client uses this interface to obtain a list of available character sets on the system. By setting a level the list can be altered from minimum to an entire set, depending on the requirement of the client. For example, a browser client can set MIMECONTF_BROWSER so it can get a list of character set that is appropriate for its character set switching menu.  IMultilanguage interface This is a top-level MLANG interface that has a set of methods to retrieve information about specified character set, or code page based on the MIME character set registry database. It also provides character set translation method. A client of this interface typically implements user interfaces to handle an end user s preference for Internet encodings. Example The following code fragment depicts a typical usage of IMultilanguage interface. It instantiates Mutilanguage object, then enumerates available list of code pages that are matching to the given criteria, in this case, MIMECONTF_BROWSER.

A client creates a conversion engine object using IMultiLanguage::CreateConvertCharset(). With the conversion engine object, MLANG can perform more efficient character set conversion than with functions in IMultiLanguage interface.  IMLangLineBreakConsole interface An object that implements this interface provides console based line-breaking service. A client uses the service to realize multilingual line-breaking functionality that varies based upon locale. IMLangString, IMLangStringAStr and IMLangStringWStr are used to provide locale/codepage-aware storage. MLANG also has standard implementation of these objects. This interface is currently designed only for usage in console based functions, such like a mail client application that needs to format a text in required column size. Example See example code in   REF _Ref395461812 \w \h   REF _Ref395461720 \h  IMLangLineBreakConsole::BreakLineW/ IMLangLineBreakConsole::BreakLineA IMLangFontLink interface This is the top-level interface that implements a set of services for an application to realize  font linking . Font linking is a term that represents a series of logic to perform automatic font-switching based on character code value of stream to be rendered. IMLangFontLink derives from IMLangCodePages, which is the foundation of font linking function. MLANG provides underlying font cache in the implementation so a client can be simple enough not to have font management routines to perform font linking. Example See examples in   REF _Ref395461862 \w \h   REF _Ref395461862 \h  IMLangFontLink interface IEnumRfc1766 interface With this interface MLANG implements a simple enumerator to get a client an array of RFC1766INFO structure that includes Windows defined locale identifiers and names as well as RFC 1766 conforming names for the locale. A client uses this service to enumerate the entire set of locale ids with human readable names.

A caller can reuse a previously created conversion engine to perform different set of source/destination character set conversion by initializing the conversion engine with this function. Argument Description uiSrcCodePage Specifies a codepage identifier value to initialize the source codepage of conversion engine. uiDstCodePage Specifies a codepage identifier value to initialize the destination codepage of conversion engine. dwProperty DWORD The caller can specify a flag value MLCONVCHARF_ENTITIZE, which means when the conversion object performs Unicode to multibyte conversion it encodes any non-displayable character code for the destination codepage into numeric entity code. Returns The conversion engine can perform character conversion based on the specified parameters. S_FALSE Specified set of source/destination is not supported. E_FAIL Failed to initialize the conversion engine because of insufficient memory or other problems. IMLangConvertCharset::GetSourceCodePage HRESULT GetSourceCodePage( /* [out] */ UINT *puiSrcCodePage); Retrieves a codepage value that is set to the conversion object. If a client has specified one of auto detect codepages when it creates the conversion object or when it calls Initlialize() function, this function returns the codepage value that the conversion object has detected for incoming string. Argument Description puiSrcCodePage UNIT * Specifies a pointer to the buffer that receives codepage value for source string. Returns The call was successful E_INVALIDARG The parameter is invalid.

Unlike DoConversion() this function is always to perform MBCS to Unicode conversion. If the destination codepage designated to the conversion object is not Unicode, the function still does the conversion but the size returned in pcDstSize is not correct. Argument Description pSrcStr LPCSTR Specifies the pointer to the string that is being converted pcSrcSize LPINT Specifies the pointer to the buffer that stores the length of source string in byte counts. If this is NULL, or If the length specified is  1, the API assumes the source string is null terminated. When conversion is successful, the function returns the number of bytes processed to this buffer. pDstStr LPWSTR Specifies the pointer to the string buffer where the conversion result is stored.  pcDstSize LPINT Specifies the pointer to the buffer that stores the length of the buffer specified with lpDstStr in character counts. When conversion is successful, the function returns the number of characters copied to lpDstStr to this buffer. Returns Performed the conversion successfully.

Unlike DoConversion() this function is always to perform Unicode to MBCS conversion. If the source codepage designated to the conversion object is not Unicode, the function still does the conversion but the result is not guaranteed. Argument Description pSrcStr LPCWSTR Specifies the pointer to the Unicode string that is being converted pSrcSize LPINT Specifies the pointer to the buffer that stores the length of source string in character counts. If this is NULL, or If the length specified is  1, the function assumes the source string is null terminated. When conversion is successful, the function returns the number of characters processed to this buffer. pDstStr LPSTR Specifies the pointer to the string buffer where the conversion result is stored.  pcDstSize LPINT Specifies the pointer to the buffer that stores the length of the buffer specified with pDstStr in bytes. When conversion is successful, the function returns the number of bytes copied to pDstStr to this buffer. Returns Performed the conversion successfully. E_FAIL Unknown error has occurred. IMLangCodePages interface GetCharCodePages HRESULT GetCharCodePages (/* [in] */ WCHAR chSrc,  /* [out] */DWORD* pdwCodePages); Retrieves a set of code pages, which a given Unicode character belongs to. Argument Description chSrc WCHAR the source Unicode character pdwCodePages DWORD the address of a set of code pages Return Value Succeeded E_FAIL Unexpected error Remarks Each bit of the set of code pages value represents a particular code page. A Unicode character can belong to multiple code pages. For example, A Unicode character, U+5B57 belongs to Japanese (932), Korean (949), Simplified Chinese (936) and Traditional Chinese (950) code pages. So four bits in the set of code pages will be set when U+5B57 is given.  The actual code page value can be retrieved by the IMLangCodePages::CodePagesToCodePage function. IMLangCodePages::GetStrCodePages HRESULT GetStrCodePages( /* [in] */ const WCHAR*  pszSrc, /* [out] */  long  cchSrc,  /* [in] */ DWORD  dwPriorityCodePages, /* [out] */  DWORD*  pdwCodePages,  /* [out] */  long*  pcchCodePages); Retrieves a set of code pages which the Unicode characters in a given string belong to together. Argument Description pszSrc const WCHAR * the source Unicode string cchSrc the number of characters in pszSrc dwPriorityCodePages DWORD a set of code pages to give priority pdwCodePages DWORD * the address of a set of code pages, or NULL pcchCodePages long * the address of the number of characters which have been processed, or NULL Return Value Succeeded E_INVALIDARG Given strings are invalid. E_FAIL Unexpected error Remarks Refer IMLangCodePages::GetCharCodePages for the idea of a set of code pages. cchSrc must be always specified even if pszSrc is a NULL terminate string. A set of code page which is returned to pdwCodePages will be the intersection of each character's the set of code pages. For example, there are three characters, A, B and C, in the given string. And the set of code pages is looks like the follows. A set of code pages of character A: Latin1, Latin2, Greek, Turkish, Hebrew and Japanese A set of code pages of character B: Latin1, Greek, Turkish and Korean A set of code pages of character C: Latin2, Greek, Turkish and Japanese The intersection of those set is Greek and Turkish. So Greek and Turkish will be returned into pdwCodePages. The actual code page value can be retrieved by the IMLangCodePages::CodePagesToCodePage function. In addition, another character D follows character A, B and Cin the given string and the set of code pages of character D is as follows. A set of code pages of character D: Latin1, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Japanese and Korean The intersection of character A, B, C and D is the empty set. In this case, the function returns 3 in pcchCodePages, and the intersection of character A, B and C in pdwCodePages. dwPriorityCodePages should be zero if no code pages have special priority. However, this parameter can ideally be used to avoid inconsistency of splitting string. Using the example above, if dwPriorityCodePages is Latin1, the function performs as follows. The given string pcchCodePages pdwCodePages ------ ----- ----- Latin1, Greek and Turkish Latin2, Greek, Turkish and Japanese Latin1, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Japanese and Korean Because character D does not have Latin1, pcchCodePages for string ABCD is 2, not 3. In the same way, if dwPriorityCodePages is Japaneses, the function performs as follows. The given string pcchCodePages pdwCodePages ------ ----- ----- Latin1, Latin2, Greek, Turkish, Hebrew and Japanese Latin1, Greek, Turkish and Korean Japanese Example: // pszSrc is a NULL terminate Unicode string. int cchDone = 0; int cchSrc = lstrlen(pszSrc); DWORD dwACP; pMLangCodePages->CodePageToCodePages(CP_ACP, &dwACP); // Give priority to CP_ACP while (cchDone < cchSrc) DWORD dwCodePages; int cchCodePages; pMLangCodePages->GetStrCodePages(psz + cchDone, cchSrc - cchDone, dwACP, &dwCodePages, &cchCodePages); // process based on dwCodePages cchDone += cchCodePages; IMLangCodePages::CodePageToCodePages HRESULT CodePageToCodePages( /* [in] */ UINT uCodePage,  /* [out] */ DWORD* pdwCodePages); Retrieves a set of code pages, which has only the given code page. Argument Description uCodePage the source code page pdwCodePages DWORD * the address of a set of code pages Return Value Succeeded E_FAIL Unknown code page is given, or unexpected error IMLangCodePages::CodePagesToCodePage HRESULT CodePagesToCodePage( /* [in] */ DWORD dwCodePages,  /* [in] */ UINT uDefaultCodePage,  /* [out] */ UINT* puCodePage); Retrieves one of code page in the given set of code pages. Argument Description dwCodePages DWORD the source set of code pages uDefaultCodePage the default code page puCodePage UINT * the address of a code page Return Value Succeeded E_FAIL Unexpected error Remarks: If one of given code pages is uDefaultCodePage, the function returns uDefaultCodePage. Example: // Enumerate code pages in dwCodePages while (dwCodePages) UINT uCodePage; DWORD dwTemporaryCodePages; pMLangCodePages->CodePagesToCodePage(dwCodePages, CP_ACP, &uCodePage); // process based on uCodePage pMLangCodePages->CodePageToCodepages(uCodePage, &dwTemporaryCodePages); dwCodePages &= ~dwTemporaryCodePages; IMLangFontLink interface Note: Every IMLangCodePages functions are available through IMLangFontLink pointer. IMLangFontLink::GetFontCodePages HRESULT GetFontCodePages( /* [in] */ /* [in] */ HFONT hFont,  /* [out] */ DWORD* pdwCodePages); Retrieves a set of code pages which the given font has. Argument Description handle of deveice context hFont HFONT handle of font object pdwCodePages DWORD * the address of a set of code pages Return Value Succeeded E_FAIL Unexpected error IMLangFontLink::MapFont HRESULT MapFont( /* [in] */ HDC hDC,  /* [in] */ DWORD dwCodePages,  /* [in] */ HFONT hSrcFont,  /* [out] */ HFONT* phDestFont); Creates font to output the characters which belong to the given set of code pages. Argument Description handle of device context dwCodePages DWORD the source set of code pages hSrcFont HFONT handle of source font object phDestFont HFONT * the address of created font object Return Value Succeeded E_FAIL Unexpected error Remarks The function creates a font object based on the given font object. The size and attributes are inherited as much as possible. The IMLangFontLink::ReleaseFont function must be called to release the font object which is returned by this function. Example DWORD dwFontCodePages; DWORD dwCharCodePages; pMLangFontLink->GetFontCodePages(hDC, hFont, &dwFontCodePages); pMLangFontLink->GetCharCodePages(ch, &dwCharCodePages); if (dwFontCodePages & dwCharCodePages) // The character ch can be output by hFont on hDC.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\shell\ext\ratings\sample\readme.txt ===
This DLL is an example of how to write a component which obtains ratings for
URLs from some external source.  The sample is quite primitive and merely
reads the ratings from a file, RATINGS.INI.  Obviously a real product would
have more work to do.

To use this component, copy SAMPLE.DLL into the system directory (usually
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM).  Then run "regsvr32 sample.dll" from there;  this will
install the appropriate registry keys.  Finally, create RATINGS.INI in the
Windows directory, with contents something like this:

[Ratings]
http://www.microsoft.com=l 0 n 0 s 0 v 0
http://www.playboy.com=l 4 n 4 s 3 v 0

[Allow]
http://www.playboy.com/allowme.htm=1

[Deny]
http://www.disney.com/denyanyway.htm=1

Then, when you browse to any sites listed in RATINGS.INI, the ratings provided
there will override any ratings found at the site itself.  The [Allow] and
[Deny] sections list URLs which should have access explicitly allowed or
denied, no matter what the user's rating restrictions are.  This simulates
an inclusion/exclusion list.

To modify this DLL for your own purposes:

The source is packaged as a Microsoft Developer Studio project.

Change the name of the component to something other than SAMPLE.DLL (this
should be done in the build environment, in the resource file version stamps,
in the .DEF file, and the string szDLLNAME in comobj.cpp).																	

Run the GUIDGEN utility (supplied with Microsoft Developer Studio, or the
Win32 SDK) to generate a CLSID for your component.  Replace the definitions
of CLSID_Sample and szOurGUID with this GUID.  Do not omit this step and just
use the GUID provided, otherwise your component may collide with that of
another ISV if they also omit this step.

Modify the code in getlabel.cpp, CSampleObtainRating::ObtainRating to retrieve
the rating for a URL from the source of your choosing.  Memory for the rating
label should be allocated using the IMalloc interface provided.

If WaitForSingleObject(hAbortEvent, 0) returns WAIT_OBJECT_0, then the user
has cancelled the download and any attempt to obtain a rating should also be
cancelled.  If obtaining the rating is a relatively quick operation (such as
reading from a local file) and is not easily divided into substeps for polling
the event, then this event can be ignored.

Also modify CSampleObtainRating::GetSortOrder to determine the priority of
your rating obtainer's ratings relative to other installable rating obtainers.
Rating obtainers with lower sort orders are called before those with higher
sort orders.  Thus, if Microsoft's label bureau obtainer (whose sort order
is 0x80000000) is called and obtains a rating for a site, then any obtainer
with a higher sort order will not even be called for that site.  If the bureau
was unable to obtain a rating, then further obtainers would be called until
a rating was found.

Microsoft's label bureau obtainer's sort order is 0x80000000.  If Microsoft
produces an obtainer which fetches from a local exclusion list, its sort order
will be 0xC0000000.  Note that a rating obtained from an installable DLL will
always override any rating found in the HTML document itself.

Install your DLL in the Windows system directory.  Run "regsvr32 <yourdll>.DLL"
or load it and call its DllRegisterServer entrypoint to install its registry
keys.  Currently the user must log off and back on (or restart the system) for
the installation of this component to take effect.

(The dhtml files and template are in the rc subdirectory.) \par  \par }{\b cpframe.htt}{ : This file is used to generate the templates cpsimple.htt and cpicon.htt using a perl script in the build process (see webvw\\dll\\makefile.inc). \par \tab cpsimple.htt  \tab : template for simple view \par \tab cpicon.htt\tab : template for icon view \par \tab Both of these files only contain an <iframe> tag. cpsimple.htt loads up cpmain_s.htt by default while cpicon.htt loads cpmain_i.htt by default in that iframe.   \par  \par When you navigate to the control panel, CControlPanelViewCallback::OnGetViewInfo() is called to determine which template is used. We hand out the right template based on the policy restrictions in effe ct. This saves us from doing the policy check in the script code in the template itself (BIG PERF WIN). \par  \par We need this outer template file (cpsimple.htt or cpicon.htt), which only contains an iframe tag, so that we can simulate the navigation to the categor y pages while remaining within the control panel namespace. So while you are navigating to the category pages in the control panel, as far as the Shell is concerned you are still in the Control Panel folder. This saves us from modifying the control panel  namespace, so we can maintain the classic view as it is (for advanced users and legacy reasons), and at the same time provide a two level hierarchy in the simple view. \par  \par }{\b cpmain_i.htt}{ :  This is the template which shows you the icon view (hence the }{\b _i}{  ). It  contains a FileList object like all other folder webview templates. Navigation to icon view is pretty fast as the only script code we need to run is to verify if we are in RTL (mirrored) mode, and adjust accordingly. We also test explorer policy to see if  we need to disable the link to \'93switch to the simple view\'94. \par  \par }{\b cpmain_s.htt}{ : This is the new simple view (hence the }{\b _s}{ ). The UI is hardcoded html in the page itself. The only script code we run on navigation is the same as that mentioned above. We do not h ave the FileList object on this page, as we do not need one. When we switch to classic view, we simply navigate to cpmain_i.htt within the parent iframe mentioned earlier. What that means is that switching views is now a navigation, if you do a back, you \rquote l l come back to the simple view. Incidentally, this behavior was not only better for perf, but Joelgross wanted it this way too ( I was against treating the switching between the views as a navigation, but was happy to oblige when it helped me improve the  perf).  \par  \par }{\b cpmain.js}{ : Contains script code common to cpmain_s.htt and cpmain_i.htt.  \par  \par }{\b cpcatgry.htt}{ : This template file is used to generate all the category pages, such as cppgat.htt (at = Appearance and Themes), cppgpoh.htt (poh = Printers and Other Hardware), etc. (see webvw\\dll\\ makefile.inc for details). This template contains three CCPTask objects. One each for the Tasks, See Also and Troubleshoot lists on the page. We also generate a table of all the control panel applets which belong to this category page. \par  \par }{\b cpcommon.js}{ :  Script code common to cpmain_s.htt and cpcatgry.htt. Basically this code determines which applets are there in a category. \par  \par }{\b cpcatgry.js}{ : Script code specific to the category pages. \par  \par }{\b cpwebvw.css}{ : The style sheet for all the control pan el pages.

However, I must point out that there is not too much to be gained there. For one, the navigation  perf to the control panel cannot be improved significantly by this method, as the main control panel templates (cpmain_s.htt and cpmain_i.htt) just use raw html with very little script code. Aslo, we would still need to use an outer template file wi th an <iframe> tag to get the correct navigation behavior, and we will need the same number of indivdual category pages files and outer pages files so that each navigation can be recorded uniquely in the travellog.  \par  \par Once we enable themed style sheets, we will have extra script code to link to the right css file. This may cause a slight additional delay, but I still think that the perf disadvantage will be too slight to merit a rewrite.  \par  \par If you just want to improve navigation perf, you might get better results by looking though the code in ctrlfldr.cpp and control1.cpp and figuring out why do we load so many dlls when navigating to the control panel?

include, bin, and lib directories are included first in your environment.
Then run the 'nmake' to build a debug build, or 'nmake nodebug=1' to build a

The SHELL32 import library in this folder is from NT 4.0 (1381).
This is used to link retail versions, since it has lego info in
it.

SHELL32.W95 is the private import library from Win95.  Link to
this for debug versions to verify the component will load on 
browser-only Win95 or NT platforms.

These are for the use of components like shdocvw, which must be 
able to run in browser-only mode.  This assures we don't accidentally 
link to a more recent version of shell32 (the one in public\sdk\lib).

Refer the accompanying def files (shelldef.nt and shelldef.w95) to see 
what exports are available on those platforms.


USER32P.NT4:  This is actually taken from NT 1528, but it has the
right exports needed for desknt4.cpl.  The exports changed in the 
real user32p.lib, so we need this to link to.

Security

There are three things that need to be secured for each Clipbook
page: the .CLP file for the page, the registry key that links the page name
with the .CLP file name, and the DDE share that allows DDE access to ClipSrv.

The .CLP file and registry key are should be given these accesses:
        Local System (services)         Full Control
        Administrators                  Full Control
        Everybody                       No Access

The DDE share's security can be set by the user using the DACL editor. The
default security is:
        Owner/Creator                   Full Control
        Everybody                       Read and Link
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\shell\osshell\accesory\clipbook\clipview\demo.txt ===
Making Clipbook Work

Do this:

1. Copy all of the files into the %_NTROOT%system32
   directory.

2. Log on as an administrator.

3. Run NINSTALL.EXE. It should give you about four "things
   are OK" message boxes.

4. Create a common program group named "Startup" if there
   isn't already one.

5. Create an icon in the "Startup" group with the command
   line     NDDEAGNT.EXE    .

This process installs NetDDE and places the Clipbook files
where they need to be.

Next,

1. Run Clipbook once and immediately exit.

2. Run Regedit.

3. Under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "Software\Description\
   Microsoft\ClipBook Viewer", create a new value named
   "EnableShare." This value has type REG_DWORD, and should
   be given a non-zero value.

This enables the current user to share Clipbook pages
on the network.

Known Problems

If you exit Clipbook with pages marked as "shared," log off,
log back on again, and run Clipbook, the pages will still be
marked as shared, but they won't be available to other
computers.

The toolbar buttons don't activate properly the first
time you select an item in the list of Clipbook pages.
To activate them, select an item and hit the <Del> key.

DON'T GO INTO "PREVIEW" OR "FULL PAGE" VIEW, YOU WILL
CRASH THE MACHINE!!! The two rightmost tools on the toolbar
do this, as do the selections "Previews" and "Full Page"
on the View menu. Don't, don't, DON'T.

NetDDE transfers data rather slowly at the moment, and
Clipbook times out of a transaction if it isn't done in
thirty seconds. Avoid transferring large data items- big
bitmaps are the main thing to avoid. Try not to transfer
more than about 40-50k on a page.

What is HyperTerminal Private Edition?
HyperTerminal Private Edition (HyperTerminal PE) is a more powerful version of HyperTerminal, which Microsoft includes with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. Hilgraeve developed HyperTerminal for Microsoft, and began providing HyperTerminal PE free for personal use shortly after the release of Windows 95. Each successive release of HyperTerminal PE has won new awards and caused the program's following to swell. It is today one of the most popular free downloads on the Internet.

PC Magazine has said, "HyperTerminal Private Edition sets a new standard for what to expect from free softwareone of the Internet's best giveaways." You can find excerpts from many other rave reviews and quotes from satisfied HyperTerminal PE users at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html.

HyperTerminal PE is provided free for personal use and at a modest charge for business use (see License Agreement, below). Business users may evaluate the product for a period of 15 days, then purchase individual or site licenses if they wish to continue using it. You can purchase a single-user license for $29.95 by double-clicking the Purchase Private Edition icon in the folder that contains HyperTerminal PE, or use our online order form at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpeord.html. For site licenses or customized versions, contact sales@hilgraeve.com, call Hilgraeve at 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or fax 734-243-0645.

You can find additional information about HyperTerminal PE or download the latest version from http://www.hilgraeve.com or the HyperTerminal BBS (734-243-9957 or telnet://htermbbs.hilgraeve.com). HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE offer a subset of the capabilities of Hilgraeve's award-winning, full-featured communications program, HyperACCESS. Businesses or individuals who need capabilities beyond those of HyperTerminal PE should consider HyperACCESS.

What is HyperACCESS?
HyperACCESS is the official FULL-POWERED upgrade from HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE. It is the product from which HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE are derived. HyperACCESS offers a wide array of additional capabilities, with a similar look and feel. HyperACCESS gives you these and many other benefits:

	Many additional terminal emulators and file transfer protocols 
	Record and play back logons and repetitive steps with VBS (Visual Basic Script) 
	Redefine keys and add your own buttons to the toolbar with text or bitmap labels 
	Automate communications with Visual Basic, VBA, C++, or other languages 

To learn about the many other advantages of HyperACCESS, browse http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html#benefits.

HyperACCESS has won top awards from every major computer magazine and been selected Editor's Choice of PC Magazine 4 times. The most recent PC Magazine award states, "Terminal communications, whether through Internet telnet connections or plain old telephone lines, has never been done better than by Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS. Elegant, clear menus and tight integration with Windows and the Internet make it our Editor's Choice among the terminal programs we looked at." For excerpts from other reviews of HyperACCESS, go to http://www.hilgraeve.com/hawin32.html#press.

People who use HyperACCESS love it. Here are some quotes from happy customers:

	"Everything (!!!!!!) worked exactly as I would want it to work!"
	"Thank you for another great product! You have once again set a Win95 standard we can use to compare all other "similar but not quite there yet" software."
	"A most excellent product! If the above doesn't make this clear, I am very, very impressed." T.K.

What is DropChute?

DropChute is a new product family from Hilgraeve, entirely separate from HyperTerminal or HyperACCESS. It's a revolutionary new kind of software -- personal file delivery software -- the fastest, easiest, most secure way to exchange files with others over the Internet, intranets, or modems. It solves the problems people experience trying to exchange files as email attachments or with ftp.

DropChute lets you:
	Deliver files of any kind to any other PC through the Internet, intranets (TCP/IP networks), or by modem, simply by dragging and dropping the files onto that person's icon.
	DropChute instantly establishes a REAL-TIME connection to the other PC and send files immediately, avoiding the time lag and insecurity of e-mail store-and-forward mechanisms.
	Send individual files, folders, or entire drives. There is no limit to the size, number, or type of files you can send.
	Send and receive all data with ironclad error correction, crash recovery and on-the-fly compression, so you can be sure files come through intact, safe, secure, and fast.
	Exchange files with complete privacy with RSA Public Key Authentication and Symmetric Key Encryption, based on Microsoft Cryptography APIs. No extra manual steps required.
	Enjoy peace of mind that files are free from more than 6,700 known computer viruses. DropChute detects and blocks viruses in incoming files using IBM virus data.
	Chat in real-time with the person at the other end before, during or after a file exchange. Attach cover notes to files, for the recipient to read.

DropChute eliminates problems associated with e-mail attachments, such as security concerns, clogged mail servers, and slow or uncertain delivery. It's easier than ftp and more secure. It exchanges files through a real-time, user-authenticated, encypted connection, so nobody can intercept and decipher the data. And it works through firewalls without breaching security.

For more information about DropChute, or download a trial copy of DropChtue Pro, go to http://www.dropchute.com, call 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or e-mail sales@hilgraeve.com.

Contacting Hilgraeve

How HyperTerminal PE is Different from HyperTerminal
On the surface, HyperTerminal PE seems identical to HyperTerminal (except for its banner screen). Both are speedy 32-bit programs that take full advantage of the Windows interface and features, such as TAPI (Telephony API) and Unimodem universal modem support. But looks can be deceiving. Each new version of HyperTerminal PE has added new features not in the versions of HyperTerminal that Microsoft provides, and has corrected problems identified after release of HyperTerminal. Sections below list the new features added in each new version of HyperTerminal PE.

HyperTerminal PE 6.0 Enhancements
	Addition of VT320 emulation
	A setting was added to control whether VTxxx emulator host-controlled printing uses the Windows print driver settings or not

HyperTerminal PE 5.0 Enhancements
	Guaranteed Y2K-Ready
	Adds VT220 terminal emulation 
	Includes fixes to avoid video problems introduced by IE 5.0 

HyperTerminal PE 4.0 Enhancements
	Define key macros to issue frequently used series of keystrokes
	Define the colors used by the terminal screen 
	Set the terminal screen size (rows and columns) 
	Full color support when emulating VT100 terminals 
	Pass-through printing now lets host systems control your printer 
	Ability to exit the program automatically when you log off 
	Includes updated entries for BBSs and systems that you can call 
	Adopts Windows new "flat" toolbar style 
	Uses Windows system sounds (WAV and audio files) instead of beeps 
	Includes bug fixes for improved use with all versions of Windows 

HyperTerminal PE 3.0 Enhancements
	Simple answer mode for accepting incoming calls 
	Ability to remap the backspace and delete keys 
	Implemented many aspects of host-controlled printing 
	Ability to use HyperTerminal PE as the default telnet application for your browser 

HyperTerminal PE 2.0 Enhancements
	Added TCP/IP support, for accessing telnet sites through the Internet 
	Improved file handling during interrupted transfers, for Zmodem crash recovery 
	Added definable redialing delay. For details, click Changing the Redial Delay, below 

HyperTerminal PE 1.0 Enhancements
	Zmodem crash recovery for resuming interrupted file transfers 
	Support for automatically redialing busy phone numbers 
	Support for foreign characters 
	Made it easy to type commands directly to the modem 
	Corrected problems with transferring files through direct cable connections 
	Added inter-character delay for sending text pasted from clipboard 
	Fixed problems that occurred with certain printers 
	Corrected subtle errors in Minitel terminal emulation 

Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE
HyperTerminal PE 6.2 is provided as a file called HTPE6.EXE. Simply execute HTPE6.EXE and follow the instructions that display. You can do this by opening the folder that contains HTPE6.EXE and double-clicking on this file, or by selecting Run from the Start menu, browsing to the folder, and selecting this file.

That's it! HyperTerminal PE is now ready to use. You start and use it the same as the HyperTerminal program provided with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000; see your Windows documentation or Help for instructions.

Using HyperTerminal PE as a Telnet Client
Using HyperTerminal PE as a telnet client is simple. You must have TCP/IP installed on your computer first. Once that is done, simply change the "Connect using" setting to "TCP/IP (Winsock)" in HyperTerminal PE's Connect To property sheet, and enter the Host address (either the host name or its numeric IP address and port number). Telnet sites are typically listed in one of the two following forms: 

Host name:port number or numeric IP address:port number

If you enter no port number, HyperTerminal PE assumes you mean port number 23, which is the default port for telnet. If the telnet site you want to reach uses a port other than 23, you will need to enter the port number.

Changing the Redial Delay
You may need to change the redial delay if your country restricts how quickly busy numbers may be redialed. (The US has no restrictions.) The default delay is two seconds. To change the delay, you must change a setting in the Windows registry: 

1. Run the Registry Editor. If you don't have a shortcut set up for the Registry Editor, type REGEDIT at a DOS prompt.
2. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder by clicking on the plus sign to the left of the folder, or double-click on the folder.
3. Open the SOFTWARE folder and the Microsoft folder that it contains in a similar fashion.
4. Open the HyperTerminal folder contained in the Microsoft folder.
5. Open the TimeToRedial folder contained in the HyperTerminal folder, and a value will appear in the window on the right.
6. Double-click on the (Default) to bring up the Edit String dialog. Enter the new value and click OK.
7. Exit the Registry Editor.

Using Special Characters
If you find that special characters aren't being sent or displayed correctly by HyperTerminal PE, try changing to a different font. Due to the way Windows maps characters under different fonts, you will see a different character displayed if you are using the Terminal font, as opposed to the other available fonts. There is a more complete discussion of font issues in the FAQs about HyperTerminal PE at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpefaq.html.

What is HyperTerminal Private Edition?
HyperTerminal Private Edition (HyperTerminal PE) is a more powerful version of HyperTerminal, which Microsoft includes with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. Hilgraeve developed HyperTerminal for Microsoft, and began providing HyperTerminal PE free for personal use shortly after the release of Windows 95. Each successive release of HyperTerminal PE has won new awards and caused the program's following to swell. It is today one of the most popular free downloads on the Internet.

PC Magazine has said, "HyperTerminal Private Edition sets a new standard for what to expect from free software...one of the Internet's best giveaways." You can find excerpts from many other rave reviews and quotes from satisfied HyperTerminal PE users at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html.

HyperTerminal PE is provided free for personal use and at a modest charge for business use (see License Agreement, below). Business users may evaluate the product for a period of 15 days, then purchase individual or site licenses if they wish to continue using it. You can purchase a single-user license for $29.95 by double-clicking the Purchase Private Edition icon in the folder that contains HyperTerminal PE, or use our online order form at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpeord.html. For site licenses or customized versions, contact sales@hilgraeve.com, call Hilgraeve at 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or fax 734-243-0645.

You can find additional information about HyperTerminal PE or download the latest version from http://www.hilgraeve.com or the HyperTerminal BBS (734-243-9957 or telnet://htermbbs.hilgraeve.com). HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE offer a subset of the capabilities of Hilgraeve's award-winning, full-featured communications program, HyperACCESS. Businesses or individuals who need capabilities beyond those of HyperTerminal PE should consider HyperACCESS.

What is HyperACCESS?
HyperACCESS is the official FULL-POWERED upgrade from HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE. It is the product from which HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE are derived. HyperACCESS offers a wide array of additional capabilities, with a similar look and feel. HyperACCESS gives you these and many other benefits:

Many additional terminal emulators and file transfer protocols 
Record and play back logons and repetitive steps with VBS (Visual Basic Script) 
Redefine keys and add your own buttons to the toolbar with text or bitmap labels 
Automate communications with Visual Basic, VBA, C++, or other languages 

To learn about the many other advantages of HyperACCESS, browse http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html#benefits.

HyperACCESS has won top awards from every major computer magazine and been selected Editor's Choice of PC Magazine 4 times. The most recent PC Magazine award states, "Terminal communications, whether through Internet telnet connections or plain old telephone lines, has never been done better than by Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS. Elegant, clear menus and tight integration with Windows and the Internet make it our Editor's Choice among the terminal programs we looked at." For excerpts from other reviews of HyperACCESS, go to http://www.hilgraeve.com/hawin32.html#press.

People who use HyperACCESS love it. Here are some quotes from happy customers:

"Everything (!!!!!!) worked exactly as I would want it to work!"
"Thank you for another great product! You have once again set a Win95 standard we can use to compare all other "similar but not quite there yet" software."
"A most excellent product! If the above doesn't make this clear, I am very, very impressed." T.K.

What is DropChute?

DropChute is a new product family from Hilgraeve, entirely separate from HyperTerminal or HyperACCESS. It's a revolutionary new kind of software -- personal file delivery software -- the fastest, easiest, most secure way to exchange files with others over the Internet, intranets, or modems. It solves the problems people experience trying to exchange files as email attachments or with ftp.

DropChute lets you:
Deliver files of any kind to any other PC through the Internet, intranets (TCP/IP networks), or by modem, simply by dragging and dropping the files onto that person's icon.
DropChute instantly establishes a REAL-TIME connection to the other PC and send files immediately, avoiding the time lag and insecurity of e-mail store-and-forward mechanisms.
Send individual files, folders, or entire drives. There is no limit to the size, number, or type of files you can send.
Send and receive all data with ironclad error correction, crash recovery and on-the-fly compression, so you can be sure files come through intact, safe, secure, and fast.
Exchange files with complete privacy with RSA Public Key Authentication and Symmetric Key Encryption, based on Microsoft Cryptography APIs. No extra manual steps required.
Enjoy peace of mind that files are free from more than 6,700 known computer viruses. DropChute detects and blocks viruses in incoming files using IBM virus data.
Chat in real-time with the person at the other end before, during or after a file exchange. Attach cover notes to files, for the recipient to read.

DropChute eliminates problems associated with e-mail attachments, such as security concerns, clogged mail servers, and slow or uncertain delivery. It's easier than ftp and more secure. It exchanges files through a real-time, user-authenticated, encypted connection, so nobody can intercept and decipher the data. And it works through firewalls without breaching security.

For more information about DropChute, or download a trial copy of DropChtue Pro, go to http://www.dropchute.com, call 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or e-mail sales@hilgraeve.com.

How HyperTerminal PE is Different from HyperTerminal
On the surface, HyperTerminal PE seems identical to HyperTerminal (except for its banner screen). Both are speedy 32-bit programs that take full advantage of the Windows interface and features, such as TAPI (Telephony API) and Unimodem universal modem support. But looks can be deceiving. Each new version of HyperTerminal PE has added new features not in the versions of HyperTerminal that Microsoft provides, and has corrected problems identified after release of HyperTerminal. Sections below list the new features added in each new version of HyperTerminal PE.

HyperTerminal PE 6.0 Enhancements
Addition of VT320 emulation
A setting was added to control whether VTxxx emulator host-controlled printing uses the Windows print driver settings or not

HyperTerminal PE 5.0 Enhancements
Guaranteed Y2K-Ready
Adds VT220 terminal emulation 
Includes fixes to avoid video problems introduced by IE 5.0 

HyperTerminal PE 4.0 Enhancements
Define key macros to issue frequently used series of keystrokes
Define the colors used by the terminal screen 
Set the terminal screen size (rows and columns) 
Full color support when emulating VT100 terminals 
Pass-through printing now lets host systems control your printer 
Ability to exit the program automatically when you log off 
Includes updated entries for BBSs and systems that you can call 
Adopts Windows new "flat" toolbar style 
Uses Windows system sounds (WAV and audio files) instead of beeps 
Includes bug fixes for improved use with all versions of Windows 

HyperTerminal PE 3.0 Enhancements
Simple answer mode for accepting incoming calls 
Ability to remap the backspace and delete keys 
Implemented many aspects of host-controlled printing 
Ability to use HyperTerminal PE as the default telnet application for your browser 

HyperTerminal PE 2.0 Enhancements
Added TCP/IP support, for accessing telnet sites through the Internet

Added definable redialing delay. For details, click Changing the Redial Delay, below 

HyperTerminal PE 1.0 Enhancements
Zmodem crash recovery for resuming interrupted file transfers 
Support for automatically redialing busy phone numbers 
Support for foreign characters 
Made it easy to type commands directly to the modem 
Corrected problems with transferring files through direct cable connections 
Added inter-character delay for sending text pasted from clipboard 
Fixed problems that occurred with certain printers 
Corrected subtle errors in Minitel terminal emulation 

Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE
HyperTerminal PE 6.3 is provided as a file called HTPE6.EXE. Simply execute HTPE6.EXE and follow the instructions that display. You can do this by opening the folder that contains HTPE6.EXE and double-clicking on this file, or by selecting Run from the Start menu, browsing to the folder, and selecting this file.

That's it! HyperTerminal PE is now ready to use. You start and use it the same as the HyperTerminal program provided with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000; see your Windows documentation or Help for instructions.

Using HyperTerminal PE as a Telnet Client
Using HyperTerminal PE as a telnet client is simple. You must have TCP/IP installed on your computer first. Once that is done, simply change the "Connect using" setting to "TCP/IP (Winsock)" in HyperTerminal PE's Connect To property sheet, and enter the Host address (either the host name or its numeric IP address and port number). Telnet sites are typically listed in one of the two following forms: 

Host name:port number or numeric IP address:port number

If you enter no port number, HyperTerminal PE assumes you mean port number 23, which is the default port for telnet. If the telnet site you want to reach uses a port other than 23, you will need to enter the port number.

Changing the Redial Delay
You may need to change the redial delay if your country restricts how quickly busy numbers may be redialed. (The US has no restrictions.) The default delay is two seconds. To change the delay, you must change a setting in the Windows registry: 

1. Run the Registry Editor. If you don't have a shortcut set up for the Registry Editor, type REGEDIT at a DOS prompt.
2. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder by clicking on the plus sign to the left of the folder, or double-click on the folder.
3. Open the SOFTWARE folder and the Microsoft folder that it contains in a similar fashion.
4. Open the HyperTerminal folder contained in the Microsoft folder.
5. Open the TimeToRedial folder contained in the HyperTerminal folder, and a value will appear in the window on the right.
6. Double-click on the (Default) to bring up the Edit String dialog. Enter the new value and click OK.
7. Exit the Registry Editor.

Using Special Characters
If you find that special characters aren't being sent or displayed correctly by HyperTerminal PE, try changing to a different font. Due to the way Windows maps characters under different fonts, you will see a different character displayed if you are using the Terminal font, as opposed to the other available fonts. There is a more complete discussion of font issues in the FAQs about HyperTerminal PE at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpefaq.html.

Richedit2 & MFC

At the time of this writting, MFC (v4.2) has no support for richedit2.  The MFC guys do not know when or how they will be adding support.

To workaround this and get richedit2 support into Wordpad today, I have snapshotted all the MFC richedit1 code and code the it is dependent on that can't be used as-is.  The changes to get this code to use richedit2 instead of richedit1 were minor - change the name of the richedit dll from riched32.dll to riched20.dll and recompile to get Unicode based data structures.

The snapshotted files are:

	afxcmn2.h
	afxcmn2.inl
	afxdlgs2.h
	afxdlgs2.inl
	afximpl2.h
	afxrich2.h
	afxrich2.inl
	dlgcomm.cpp
	dlgfnt.cpp
	oleimpl3.h
	oleinit.cpp
	stdafx2.h
	viewrich.cpp
	winctrl2.cpp
	winctrl4.cpp

These files can be removed one MFC gets native richedit support.  Note that until then the sources files defines _AFX_NO_RICHEDIT_SUPPORT to prevent MFC from using any of it's native richedit support - and maybe conflicting with the wordpad version.

One more change that will probably have to be made after MFC gets up to speed is the name of the base classes that wordpad uses.  I chose to simply add a "2" after the word "RichEdit" in all the native MFC classes - e.g. CRichEdit2View instead of CRichEditView.  If MFC uses a different naming scheme then the code will have to be revised.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6Times New Roman Symbol Building the Wordpad converters Notes about the converter code The converter code is owned by the Word group.  It is not built by the NT build lab so if the code changes it will have to built seperately.  The binaries are stored in wordpad\conv\<arch>.  It generally should not be necessary to build them very often because the source is fairly old and not under active development.  Contacts in the Word group for the converters are: Rob Little (Dev), Stephan Mueller (Dev), and Mandira Virmani (Pgm Mgmt). The converter code is on \\lemur\slm.  The name of the project is conv95. The NT build environment This document assumes that you are familiar with and are using the NT build evironment, know how to start razzle, where you mstools directory is, etc. A note on RISC machines The native build environment for the convertor code uses several tools that don't exist for some or all of the RISC platforms.  To workaround this problem you will need to install Wx86 (the RISC x86 emulator) and use the x86 versions of these tools Building the Word6 converter Enlisting in the converters project Install Wx86 if necessary Create a razzle environment Make a directory called "conv95" somewhere convenient.  This will be your enlistment set the CONV_PRJ environment variable to the full path of your conv95 directory cd /d %CONV_PRJ% enlist -gs \\lemur\slm -p conv95 ssync the top level directory - "ssync -u" ssync the necessary subdirectories - "ssync -ru bldtools core ww6 chmap" This next step copies changes to the conv95 project necessary to bring the word6 converter code up to date.  The files here are not checked in to the conv95 sources because the Word guys don't want to change these old sources. cd /d %CONV_PRJ%\core xcopy /r %_NTDRIVE%%_NTROOT%\private\windows\shell\accesory\wordpad\conv\core The following instructions are for RISC machines only.  They copy the x86 build tools to the RISC tools directories.  Note that some of the files and directories may already exist - don't worry about it because the set of existing tools in not complete. cd bldtools mkdir bin<arch> where <arch> is one of x86, alpha, mips, or ppc. cd bin<arch> copy ..\binx86 xcopy /r fteent.exe ftee.exe xcopy /r \\lemur\slm\src\conv96\tools\binx86\perl.exe cd ..\.. For all platforms - do the actual build cd ww6 set NT_WORDPAD=1 set NT_TOOLS=<full path of your mstools directory> copy msvcrt.lib and oldnames.lib from %_NTDRIVE%\nt\public\sdk\lib\<arch> Build the convertors - "m NT DLL fast".  Leave off the "fast" for debug builds.  make.log will contain a log of the build process cd ntdll_f rename mswd6_32.cnv mswd6_32.wpc splitsym -a mswd6_32.wpc You will now have mswd6_32.wpc, mswd6_32.dbg and mswd6_32.map Normal Default Paragraph Font

CHANGES:  form type is now 'ACON'.  Added a LIST chunk of type 'fram' around the icon chunks.  Added an optional DISP chunk.

General description of RIFF file formats

The animated cursor file format for Windows NT is an extension of the RIFF file format as described in chapter 8 of the Microsoft Windows Multimedia Programmer's Reference.  Basically, a RIFF file is built out of chunks, where a chunk described in C syntax would be:

typedef unsigned long DWORD;
typedef unsigned char BYTE;
typedef DWORD FOURCC;		// Four-character code

typedef struct {
    FOURCC	ckID;
    DWORD	ckSize;		// the size of field <ckData>
    BYTE	ckData[ckSize];	// the actual data of the chunk
} CK;

Chunks of type 'RIFF' or 'LIST' are made up of a form type, followed by a series of sub chunks.  A form type is a FOURCC tag.  For the animated cursor files, the RIFF form type is 'ANI '.  A LIST chunk with form type 'INFO' is used to store information that describes the RIFF file.

RIFF files are usually described using a grammar that is defined in chapter 8 of the Microsoft Windows Multimedia Programmer's Reference.  In simplified form, the above CK structure would be represented in the grammar as:  ckID (  <ckData> ).  If the chunk had a form type of 'foo ', then it would be represented as ckID( 'foo ' <ckData> ).

For a more detailed description of the Windows Multimedia RIFF file format, see chapter 8 of the Microsoft Windows Multimedia Programmer's Reference.


Windows NT Animated Cursor RIFF Files

For Windows NT, an animated cursor is stored in RIFF a file with a form type of 'ACON'.  The subcunks of this form of RIFF file are the 'LIST', 'anih', 'rate', and 'seq ' chunks.  There are two LIST chunks: the LIST chunk with type 'INFO' contains textual informative details about the animated cursor, the LIST chunk with a type of 'fram' contains 'icon' subchunks.  The anih chunk describes the rest of the subchunks in the file.  The 'rate' chunk tells how long each step of the animation is to be displayed on the screen.  The 'seq ' chunk maps the animation steps into actual icon pictures stored in the .ani file.  The 'icon' subchunks in the 'fram' LIST are the actual frames of the cursor animation.

The following is a RIFF grammar (as defined in the Microsoft Windows Multimedia Programmer's Reference) that describes the Windows NT animated cursors:

RIFF( 'ACON'
    [LIST( 'INFO' <info_data> )]
    [<DISP_ck>]
    anih( <ani_header> )
    [rate( <rate_info> )]
    ['seq '( <sequence_info> )]
    LIST( 'fram' icon( <icon_file> ) ... )
)

WhereMeans:<info_data>Information subchunks as defined in the Microsoft Windows Multimedia Programmer's Reference.
<DISP_ck>An optional Display Chunk as defined in the Multimedia Data Standards Update.  Windows NT version 3.1 will ignore any DISP_ck chunks it finds.  None of the animated cursors supplied with Windows NT version 3.1 will contain a DISP_ck chunk.
<ani_header>An animated cursor header (see ANIHEADER struct).  The ANIHEADER structure describes the size of the animated cursor, and must come before the 'rate', 'seq ', or any 'icon' chunks.
<rate_info>A list of JIF's (one for each step) that indicate the time that each step should remain on the screen.  If this chunk is missing, then the default rate value specified in the ANIHEADER is used.  A JIF is nothing more than a DWORD that holds the display time value in jiffies.  One jiffy equals 1/60th of a second.
<sequence_info>A list of indices into the 'fram' LIST of icons.  Each index points to the icon that is to be displayed for that step of the animated cursor.  The indices are 0 based.  If this chunk is missing, then the icons are played in the order they occur in the file.  To save space, it is common for the same icon to be referenced by different elements of the sequence list.
<icon_file>An embedded .CUR file as generated by the WindowsNT IMAGEDIT program.  There are usually multiple icon subchunks in the file.  Each icon represents a frame of  the animated cursor.  If present, the seq chunk determines the order in which the frames are displayed on the screen.
Structure Definitions:

typedef DWORD JIF;		/* Number of jiffies that a frame 						 	 * will remain on the screen 
					 */

typedef struct _ANIHEADER {     /* anih */
    DWORD cbSizeof;	/* Num. bytes in aniheader (incl. cbSizeof) */
    DWORD cFrames;	/* Number of unique icons in the ani. cursor*/
    DWORD cSteps;		/* Number of blts before the animation cycles */
    DWORD cx, cy;		/* reserved, must be 0 */
    DWORD cBitCount, cPlanes;	/* reserved, must be 0 */
    JIF   jifRate;	/* default rate if rate chunk not present */
    DWORD fl;		/* flags, see AF_* */
} ANIHEADER, *PANIHEADER;

#define AF_ICON     0x0001L   /* Windows format icon/cursor animation */

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft D3Dsaver: a Direct3D 8 Title _PID_HLINKSD3Dsaver: a Direct3D 8 Michael D. Anderson Normal.dot Michael D. Anderson Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU D3DSaver: a Direct3D 8.0 Screensaver Framework By Mike Anderson (  HYPERLINK "mailto:manders@microsoft.com"  manders@microsoft.com Last updated 2/26/2001 Goals The D3DSaver framework has the following goals: Similar to  D3D Framework  used in DXSDK sample apps As simple as possible, but no simpler Support Win9x, Win2000, Whistler Suitable for porting OpenGL-based screensavers (Flowerbox, Pipes, etc.) Classes The author of a screensaver using D3DSaver should create a class derived from CD3DScreensaver containing all member variables and functions specific to that screensaver.  Variables representing per-device objects should be modularized to allow support for multiple monitors.  WinMain should declare a local instance of the derived screensaver class, call Create() on it, then Run() on it.  When Run() returns, WinMain and the screensaver should exit. Program Initialization CD3DScreensaver::Create() creates the D3D object, then uses that object to build a list of available adapters, devices, and display modes.  It also calls ReadSettings to get the user s preferred settings for the screensaver.  In preview mode, we pause right after creating the window to give the display control panel time to refresh its window so there isn t a long pause at startup (this is done by posting WM_USER, then entering a limited message loop that waits for the WM_USER (indicating that all initial messages are processed), then setting a timer to go off in 500ms.  When the WM_TIMER comes through, initialization proceeds).  CD3DScreensaver::Run() determines what mode to run it based on the command-line parameters.    runs the screensaver in configuration mode.  In other words, the config dialog should be shown.    runs the screensaver in test mode, which is only used at development time.  In test mode, the screensaver runs in a window and does not get interrupted by mouse movement or keypresses.    runs the screensaver in preview mode, which is a windowed mode where the parent window is specified (this is what you see in the display control panel).    runs the screensaver in password-change mode, in which the user can specify a new password.  Any other command line options (typically  ) run the screen saver in   mode.  Test and Full mode proceed via the DoSaver() function.  DoSaver() creates the main window and initializes D3D. D3D Initialization D3DSaver screensavers can run in one of two graphics modes: windowed, or fullscreen.  In fullscreen mode, a fullscreen render unit (which encapsulates a D3D device and other info) is created for each screen.  In windowed mode, a single, windowed render unit is created.  When creating a fullscreen render unit, D3DSaver tries to use the preferred mode specified by the user.  If that mode doesn t exist, or if the user requested  Automatic  mode, D3DSaver starts with the mode closest to the desktop display mode.  If it cannot create the D3D device at that mode, it tries progressively-smaller (lower-res) modes until there are none left.  This is because the video card may not have enough memory to run in some modes.  When creating a windowed render unit, D3DSaver finds a back buffer format compatible with the desktop and creates a D3D device in that format. Rendering DoSaver() contains the message pump.  If window messages are in the queue, they are dispatched to the WndProc.  Otherwise, Render3DEnvironment() is called to update the display.  It switches to each render unit, handles lost devices, calls Render() to render the frame image, then uses Present to update the display.  Render() is implemented within each screensaver client.  It can make use of SetProjectionMatrix() to set the projection matrix approprately for each subset of the scene (in multimon), or it can use m_rcRenderTotal and m_rcRenderCurDevice itself to determine what to render to each monitor. Window Messages and Interruption In full mode, mouse movements and keypresses can generate interruptions, which indicate that the user may want to exit the screen saver.  On Win2000, the screen saver can simply exit and the shell will take care of presenting the password (if any) and reinitializing the screensaver if the password is not entered correctly.  On Win9x, however, the screensaver is responsible for showing the password dialog and only quitting if the password is entered correctly. Error Mode If an error situation occurs which prevents the graphics from working (couldn t create D3D device, couldn t load media, etc), the screensaver enters error mode which uses GDI instead of D3D.  The screens go black and a small white box bounces around each monitor.  The box contains text explaining the nature of the error.  Screensaver interruption works as usual.

==================================================
DONE:
==================================================
10. Add View Time Slider
8. Make Object.cpp multi-monitor safe.
11. Create CTexture to handle multiple devices and ratio.
11. Fix ugly MIPMAP on floor.
15. Paintings don't repeat.
1. Remove reverse ordering so everything is correctly layered.
2. Remove Lobby
1. Paintings repeat.


==================================================
TODO: (BryanSt)
==================================================


# Blocking
2. Fix window frames.
3. Hide Power Options

4. License textures.

5. Walk closer to paintings and smooth walk.
6. Is View Distored?


# High Priority
12. Check video ram and memory ram and cap painting size on screen.
8. Add nice frames and/or Make frames by parts.
7. Add more Rooms (If Doors, Middle Paintings, Benches, Exit Enter Door, Walk straight thru room, Long Room) Make room 300x100 instead of current 200x100, so it looks more like a museum. Make 200x200 room.
3. If you have a small number of pictures(3), it will render no pictures.

19. Leave door you entered.


# Medium Priority
5. Add Benches
14. Create nice arch ways.
x. Note frame stats: Textures used, triangles, etc.


# Low Priority
4. Replace textures
9. Allow Full Zoom
3. Background thread for painting conversion.
13. Clean up UI Options.  (Zoom, Stair time, Ok/Cancel, ...)
6. Add Loading Sign.  This will give time for the images to be loaded.
9. Add Lights on floor and paintings

Punted:
13. Add Enter Room with Text
6. Add Paintings in the middle

NITS:

==================================================
TODO: (MAnders)
==================================================

# Blocking
1. Add visibility testing by implementing BOOL Is3DRectViewable(pD3DDevice, D3DVECTOR vStart, D3DVECTOR vSize)
2. Walk closer to paintings and smooth walk.


# High Priority
2. Fix flashing every other frame.  Is Depth buffering not working?
3. Make the camera movement look more natural by using splines or other techniques.  This is important to make it look real.  Randomize how to stand from the paintings.  Maybe have the camera sit on a bench.
4. The software render is not working on my ATI Rage 3D cards.


# Medium Priority
5. Why does sides of the room appear to have warp?
6. Add lighting either to floor and maybe to paintings.  This will make the room much more realistic since it won't be so much the same.

# Low Priority
7. Add Bump map so paintings stand out.  This is needed to keep things realistic.



Optional:
==================
20. Add Picture Names

Bug Notes

Initialization is hard to follow
Conditional statements for tests that could not possibly true.
Invalid setting of flags
Improperly initialized structures before calling SPI_GETHIGHCONTRAST
Obsolete functions being used
Non-NULL values passed to functions that require NULL values
There was code that appended spaces to color scheme and then more code that removed the spaces - looked like 2 programmers worked on it. 
There were loops that would never execute.
Incorrect array sizes passed to many, many functions
Variables declared, initialized but never used
HIGHCONTRAST and MOUSEKEYS did not have ??F_HOTKEYSOUND and ??F_CONFIRMHOTKEY flags set properly
Functions exist that never get called
Incorrect access rights specified when creating a registry key - system would not allow values to be set.
Code fragments repeated throughout
Repeated useless code: x = 5; x = 5;
FilterKeys Slider controls were handled incorrectly - worked on Win95 by coincidence

SPI_?ETKEYBOARDPREF is not on WinNT
SPI_?ETHIGHCONTRAST is not on WinNT
SPI_?ETSERIALKEYS is not on WinNT
// NT doesn't support SSF_INDICATOR but it's not documented or exposed by this Applet.
SOUNDSENTRY.iFSTextEffect is not supported on WinNT
SOUNDSENTRY.iWindowsEffectMSec is not supported on WinNT

MouseKeys:
WinNT only supports: MKF_MOUSEKEYSON, MKF_AVAILABLE, MKF_HOTKEYACTIVE, MKF_HOTKEYSOUND
WinNT does not support: MKF_CONFIRMHOTKEY, MKF_INDICATOR, MKF_MODIFIERS, MKF_REPLACENUMBERS

No one knows for sure who invented the game, but several sources attribute its creation to a prisoner in the Bastille.  The game was very popular throughout Europe in the 1800s , where it was  known as "Peg Solitaire" because it was played by moving pegs in a wooden board. \par \pard \s6\li360\sa31  \par \pard \s6\li360\sa31 Pegged is played by jumping a peg across any adjacent peg and placing it in an open space on the other side.

        Notes on how to use the Type 1 Installer under Win32.
        -----------------------------------------------------




INTRODUCTION

The Type 1 Installer exists in many different forms. This text
describes the use of it as a Win32 DLL. The DLL acts as a compiler
that parses an Adobe type 1 font format file and a metrics file (PFB
+ PFM), and then produces a TrueType font file.

The DLL will interact with the event log and the registry, under
certain conditions. The registry is always queried at the start of
the conversion to verify if the copyright holder has agreed to have
their font converted. The event log is used if an error occurs and if
the "Log events" entry in the registry is not zero. The required
entries in the registry is described in "t1instal.ini". Use
regini.exe to load these settings.




USING THE DLL

There are two functions in the interface of the DLL. Use
"t1instal.h" to get the prototypes for these functions, and to get
the definitions of the values they return.


IsType1A
    This function determines if a file is a valid Printer Font
    Metrics files (pfm), and returns the face name of the font. This
    function will only return TRUE if there is a valid PFB file in
    the same directory or in the parent directory.


ConvertTypefaceA
    This function takes the name of a PFM, a PFB and a TTF file as
    parameters, that are used in the conversion.

    This function will call a supplied callback function during the
    conversion. The caller may thus display messages to the user
    about the progress of the conversion. This function is called
    with an integer that indicates the rate of the progress
    (typically in the range 0-100), and a caller supplied argument.



BUILDING THE DLL

The DLL can be compiled with a number of features turned on or off.
Define or undefine the following symbols when compiling the code to
get the desired result:



name                    Usage
----                    -----
DOT                     Replaces the period character in the converted
                        font. Used to tag converted fonts such that
                        they can be distinguished from the original
                        fonts.

NOMSGBOX                Causes the DLL to use stdio to report errors.

NOCOPYRIGHTS            Disables the copyright checking.

SHOWCOPYRIGHT           This casues the converter to store the
                        encrypted copyright strings in the event log,
                        without converting the font. Put this string
                        in the appropriate place in the registry to
                        enable the conversion of fonts from the
                        fonts vendor of that font.

RELATIVESTEMS           Enables a hint conversion features. Must be
                        turned on.

SYMETRICS_REDUCTION     Enables a hint conversion feature. Should not
                        be turned on.

NOANSIWINMAC            Causes glyhs that are not part of the Windows
                        ANSI and MacIntosh character set to be
                        filterd out. Turn this on if the OS is not
                        supporting UNICODE, to get smaller fonts.


By default, only the RELATIVESTEMS should be defined.


SETTING UP THE REGISTRY

Remove the comments from the t1instal.ini file and use regini utility
to place new keys in registry for use.

regini t1instal.ini

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
	The message logging mechanism in the Type 1 Installer.


Messages are recorded/displayed based on the severity of an error and based on the state of the "log events" key in the registry. There are three types of messages:
- Errors		: A problem that cased the conversion to abort.
- Warnings	: A non-fatal problem that the converter resolved.
- Information	: Information that may be useful to trace the execution of the
		conversion, such as the name of the font and the vendor.

If an error occurs then a pop-up is presented to the user with the appropriate message. Note that this will always happened, regardless of the "log events" key. These strings are defined in the string table in the dll's resource file (t1instal.rc).

The "log events" key is used for PSS and for debugging . It should not be used by the users. It should only be turned on when attempting to determine the cause of a failed conversion. This key causes all messages to be stored such that they are accessible by the Event Viewer. These strings are defined in the dll's message file (t1msg.mc). Note that warnings are being displayed in pop-up dialogs, in addition to errors, when "log events" is non zero.

The motivation for this approach is that PSS may need to be able to remotely resolve a problem that a customer has when converting a type 1 font. PSS will be able to do this by instructing the user to turn on the "log events" feature and get immediate feed-back when an error or a warning pops up a message. A computer that is connected to a network can be accessed directly through the Event Viewer by the PSS engineer.

Note from Babakj for BabakJ:

- Take a close look at Alloc calls (also PAlloc) for segmented code
- Do the same  for MAKELONG and MAKEWORD, etc.
- The file port.txt in \\brillig\ntct\babakj\solit has the list of
  changes proposed by Preport utility. SetBitmapBits() and CreateBitmaps() 
  seem to be the only dev-dependent APIs used. They are only used if building
  for Win 2.x (if WINVER_2 defined). 
- LoadBitmap() is crucial for Solitair. Make sure it's included in Win32 APIs.

    - Warning Removal for compiles


*ConTime

 Conversion times are calculated in the following way ...

 ConTime/ManWeeks = ((LOC/1000)/1.78KLOC)

		    Conversion speed metric (1.78KLOC/MW) was
		    gotten from [jonma:patt] and is from pmct group
		    statistics kept for converting relatively clean

This is a minimal description of this code, ntshrui.dll.


What it is
----------

This is a port/rewrite of the Win95 msshrui.dll (Win95 SLM source found in
\\flipper\chinet\src\wnet\msshrui, Win96+ on \\trango\slm\...). It provides a
"Sharing" property page for directories to allow local LanMan (SMB) shares
to be created for the selected directory. It provides a "Sharing..."
context menu to provide quick access to the "Sharing" property page.
It also provides a "Sharing" copy hook to handle directory renames and
move/deletes properly by warning the user about the shares that may
be need to be deleted in the process (shares aren't recreated based
on the directory's new name). Finally, there are a few API entrypoints
for programs to perform Share operations.

All of this functionality is dependent on being able to execute a NetShareEnum
at level 502, which requires Administrators local group or comm, print,
or server operator group membership. The APIs will fail and there will be no
Sharing UI in the explorer if this is not true.

One goal of the Win95 shell, carried forward to the NT shell, is to
be completely independent of network-specific code. The shell will
call WNet apis, which are network-independent. However, there are
no network-independent share creation APIs. Thus, the shell consults
the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Network\SharingHandler key to determine the
network-specific sharing handler DLL. Note that under Windows 95,
only one server at a time was allowed to run. Under NT, multiple
servers may run (SFM -- Macintosh, FPNW -- NetWare, SMB -- Windows
Networking). However, the shell hasn't been expanded to handle this.

The exported APIs are:

    DllGetClassObject
    DllCanUnloadNow
    IsPathSharedA
    IsPathSharedW
    IsPathShared = IsPathSharedA
    SharingDialogA
    SharingDialogW
    SharingDialog = SharingDialogA
    GetNetResourceFromLocalPathA
    GetNetResourceFromLocalPathW
    GetNetResourceFromLocalPath = GetNetResourceFromLocalPathA
    GetLocalPathFromNetResourceA
    GetLocalPathFromNetResourceW
    GetLocalPathFromNetResource = GetLocalPathFromNetResourceA

There are A and W versions for all of these, even though there aren't
clients for all versions of the API. Namely, the shell uses the W
versions. However, the SharingDialog API is used only in its A version
by the FAX group (they are the only known client). However, to avoid
problems later, both A and W versions are implemented.

There are two Windows 95 APIs not implmented:

    PrintShareProperties
    ShareShutdownNotify

The implemented, exported APIs do the following:

    DllGetClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow -- standard OLE entrypoints. Used
        for the shell extensions (context-menu, property sheet, copy hook).
    IsPathShared -- returns TRUE if a path is shared. Used by the shell to
        determine when to put a "sharing" hand on a folder. Must be fast, as
        the shell calls it for every folder it displays.
    SharingDialog -- Displays the same dialog as the property sheet page, but
        in a modal dialog form. used by the FAX group.
    GetNetResourceFromLocalPath -- Given a local path on a machine, returns
        a UNC form of that path, if the path is shared. This is used to store
        a network-aware form of the path in a shortcut for use if the shortcut
        is copied to another machine, such that the local path stored in the
        shortcut isn't available.
    GetLocalPathFromNetResource -- The opposite of the above, it determines
        the local path of an object given a UNC path.


The Sharing page
----------------

The Sharing property page and context-menu shortcut should appear when the
user right-clicks on anything that corresponds to a file system directory.
This is basically a folder or a disk icon. The drive can be either a hard
drive, a floppy, or a CD-ROM. We only support the page when the folder or
drive is local: the page is not available when looking at remote folders
either via a UNC path in the network neighborhood or via a mapped drive
letter path.

The Sharing page behaves as follows. If there are no shares, the "Not Shared"
radio button is checked and everything inside the "Shared As" radio button box
is grayed. Clicking "Shared As" ungrays the controls within its box.

There are two "modes" when the "Shared As" button is checked: initial mode and
already-shared mode. Initial mode is when the folder has not yet been shared.
In this case, the "Share name" control is a single-line edit control. All the
controls can be used to enter information for one new share. In
"already-shared" mode, the folder already is shared with one or more names.
In this case, the "Share name" control is a drop-down list box with a list of
shares for this directory. The other controls are filled with the data
associated with the share currently selected in the drop-down control. Changing
the comment, user limit, or permissions at this point causes the selected
share to be modified accordingly, but does not add a new share.

Note that standard property sheet semantics hold with all the changes made to
the sharing characteristics of the selected folder, namely, that no changes
are actually made to the machine state until "OK" or "Apply" is chosen.

In initial mode, only a single share can be created (unless you hit "apply"
and subsequently change to "already-shared" mode). In already-shared mode,
there are one or two additional buttons to control creating/deleting shares.
The "New Share..." button will always be visible in this mode. Pressing it
pops up a "New Share" modal dialog that allows you to create another share
name for the same directory. This other share might have a different comment,
different user limit, and most importantly, different permissions. The
operation of the controls in this dialog are identical to the operation of
the controls on the property sheet in "initial" mode. If there are two or
more shares for the directory, then the "Remove Share" button is visible.
Pressing this removes the currently selected share (pending "OK" or
"Apply" of course).

To delete the final share, or to delete all the shares at once, you must
choose the "Not shared" radio button. If there is currently more than one
share for the directory, this confirmation message is displayed:

    This folder is shared more than once. Are you sure you wish
    to remove all these shares?

    yes/no

Hitting "no" causes the "Shared As" button to be clicked again. Hitting "yes"
causes all shares to be marked for removal. However, the shares are still
left in the property sheet, but grayed. If the "Shared As" button is pressed
again, then it will be as if the "Not Shared" button was never pressed: all
share properties are retained, and hitting "Apply" or "OK" will make all
previously requested changes.

A default share name is put in the "Share Name" SLE in "initial" mode, as
follows. If the directory is not the root of the volume, for example,
C:\foo\bar, then the default share name is the last component of the path,
in this case, bar.  If the directory is a root, then the default is the drive
letter, in the previous example, C. However, if the default name is already
used as a share name on the system, then there is no default given.

The user limit controls work as follows. The "Allow" text box allows
the user to enter a specific number of users. Only numbers are allowed to
be typed: no letters or other characters. If the number is out of range,
the number reverts to the default user limit (10) when the edit control loses
focus. Note that no error message is given: we do this silently. Up and down
arrows increase and decrease the number. Since we are using the Win95
up/down control, the range for the number is 1 to 32767. The number doesn't
wrap. If the user chooses "Maximum allowed" after having typed a number in
the "allow" edit box, the edit box is cleared but the number is remembered.
If the user subsequently clicks the "allow" radio button, the remembered
number is reinserted into the edit control as the default.

The Permissions button brings up the standard security (ACL) editor with
the permissions of the share. The default permissions for a share are World
access, Full control. As with everything else, the permissions aren't
committed until the property page "OK" or "Apply" button is pressed.

Note that hitting the escape key should cancel the property page no matter
what the current keyboard focus is. I mention this because I've had problems
getting this to work with the focus on the (subclassed) "Allow" edit control.

If the user types a share name that is the same as another share for this same
directory (in the "New Share" dialog), then the following warning message
is displayed:

    The share name %1 already exists for this resource. Please
    choose another share name.

If the user types a share name in the "New Share" dialog or on the property
sheet (initial mode, and then hits "Apply" or "OK"), and that name is the same
as another share on the machine for another path, then this message is
displayed:

    You are already sharing %1 using the name %2. Do you want
    to share %3 using the name %2 instead?

If the user hits "yes", then we use the new name as a new share, and put the
other share on a list of "shares of the same name but different directories"
to delete when the user hits "OK" or "Apply".

The share names are validated as follows. If no share name is typed in you
get this error:

    You must type a share name for this resource.

If you use illegal characters in the share name (particularly *, but there may
be others), you get this error:

    The share name contains invalid characters.

If the name is not accessible from DOS, because it isn't 8.3 or for some other
reason, you get this warning:

    The share name %1 is not accessible from some MS-DOS
    workstations. Are you sure you want to use the share name?

Note that there is special handling code to allow users to create and delete
the default disk shares, namely <drive>$ for each hard drive, and admin$. Only
configuration of IPC$ is not supported, as it has no associated storage.
These are handled specially as follows. Selecting one of them, getting the
sharing property page, and pressing "Permissions" will pop up the message:

    This has been shared for administrative purposes.
    The permissions cannot be set.

When the share name is being validated in the property page or "New Share"
dialog, a check is made against "IPC$". If it matches, this message is
displayed:

    The share names ADMIN$ and IPC$ are reserved and may not be used.

Note that we mention ADMIN$ as a restricted share name, even though we allow
its creation in one particular case. If they use the name "ADMIN$", we
disallow it for all cases except if the selected directory is the Windows
directory, since that is the only place ADMIN$ can share.

We do allow the creation of <drive>$ shares at places besides the proper
drive. I.e., we allow you to share D:\ as C$. If, however, you share C:\ as
C$, it gains special "default" status, any permissions you may have edited are
discarded (silently) and the default permissions are instantiated.



Applying changes
----------------

When the user hits "OK" or "Apply" the following things occur. First, the
list of shares with the same name as new shares but with different directories
is deleted. Second, all share changes for the current directory are applied:
either added, deleted, or modified. The following error messages may occur
if we get a network error. For add:

    An error occurred while trying to share %1. %2

    The shared resource was not created at this time.

For delete:

    An error occurred while trying to delete share %1. %2

For modify:

    An error occurred while trying to modify share %1. %2

After the changes are applied, the page is refreshed. This is unnecessary
if the user hit "OK", but essential if they pressed "Apply". The Apply button
is grayed out, indicating there are no pending changes. Note that the act of
applying changes might convert the page from "already-shared" mode to initial
mode or vice-versa.

When a share to be deleted that is currently being accessed by a user, one of
the following error messages will be displayed (the same error messages are
used in the copy hook handler):

    There are %1!d! user(s) connected to %2. If you stop sharing %2,
    they will be disconnected. Do you want to continue?

    There are %1!d! file(s) open by %2!d! user(s) connected to %3.
    If you stop sharing %3, the files will close, which may cause
    these users to lose data. Do you want to continue?

One bug to beware of: when adding a second or greater share, or when deleting
shares but leaving at least one, the combo box of shares should be re-filled
correctly with the new set of shares for the directory.


Copy hook
---------

A copy hook in the tool monitors shell rename/move/delete operations on
directories. If the directory or a subdirectory is shared, then an appropriate
error message is displayed and the user is forced to verify the operation.
In particular, one of the following messages will be displayed:

    There are %1!d! user(s) connected to %2. If you stop sharing %2,
    they will be disconnected. Do you want to continue?

    There are %1!d! file(s) open by %2!d! user(s) connected to %3.
    If you stop sharing %3, the files will close, which may cause
    these users to lose data. Do you want to continue?

    You are sharing %1 as %2. Others may be using files in this
    folder. If you delete the folder, it will no longer be shared.
    Are you sure you want to delete it?


Security editor
---------------

If the security editor DLL (acledit.dll) can't be loaded, this message is
reported:

Error invoking the security editor.


Initialization
--------------

All of the above discussion assumes that the LanMan server service is
running. This section describes how we determine the server is running,
how we initialize our cache of shares (subsequently used by the Explorer
to use for annotating folders with "hand" icons), what we do if the server
is started manually after boot time, and what we do if the server is stopped
sometime after boot time.

Windows 95 initializes during DLL initialization by doing a NetServerGetInfo
to determine if the server is running. We can't do this because it is bad
to do net operations in DLL initialization code, for reasons having to do
with the process mutant. In addition, because the server is a service
controlled by the service controller that can be started manually and stopped
at will, we would like to update the display of visible shares in the
Explorer whenever the server starts or stops. For instance, if the server
stops, we would like to remove all the "hand" icons from visible shared
folders.

Ideally, we would receive a notification from either the service controller
or the server service whenever the server starts or stops. Since there is no
support for this in the system, and none is likely to appear soon, we do two
things. One, during initialization we wait as appropriate for the server to
start. Note that the server starts asynchronously from the shell at boot time,
so it is more than conceivable that the shell will start before the server
does. In this case, if we can detect that the server is configured to start
and is in fact starting, then we wait for it. We have certain timeouts to
ensure that we don't wait too long. Secondly, if the server starts or stops
after the shell has started, the user only needs to hit "refresh" in one
Explorer window. If at this point we notice that the server has changed state,
then we cause *all* explorer windows to refresh.


Test scenarios
--------------

The following are a list of ad-hoc test scenarios to pursue on this component.
In all cases, assume there are two machines: A and B, and the user is sitting
at machine A.

For the next few scenarios, log on as a normal user (not power user or
administrator, etc).

-- Be sure there is no sharing UI, even for things known to be shared.
Exercise copy hook functionality by renaming/moving/deleting a directory.

-- Rename a directory known to be shared. Log off, Log on as administrator.
NOTE: There is no UI (save for winfile / server manager) to get rid of the
orphaned share! Rename the directory back to the name that was shared.
See if the explorer paints the "sharing" hand on it.

-- Invoke all the APIs programmatically, and be sure they return appropriate
errors.

For the rest of these, log on as a member of the Administrators group.

-- Open My Computer. Be sure the "Sharing..." context-menu item appears on
all local drive objects, on floppy drives, and on CD-ROMs. Be sure it doesn't
appear on network-mapped drive letters. Share each of them.

-- Notice that hard drive roots (c:\, d:\, etc) should be shared by default, as
should the windows directory via ADMIN$. On the sharing property page for
these, press "Permissions" and notice you get a warning message disallowing
permissions changes.

-- Remove and recreate the default shares, including ADMIN$. Create a share
C$ on D:\, and note that it isn't a default share at that point (you can edit
its permissions).

-- Share a directory. Hit apply. Add a number of shares. Hit apply. Make sure
the combo box is correct. Delete a bunch of shares, hit apply. Make sure the
combo is once again correct.

-- Make sure the "New Share" and "Remove Share" appear and disappear at the
proper times.

-- Make sure the tab order doesn't include the "allow x users" edit control
or spin button unless the "Allow" radio button is selected.

-- Make sure the comment is limited to 256 characters, and the share name to
80 characters, in both the "initial mode" property page and the "New Share"
dialog.

-- Make sure context-sensitive help appears on all relevant controls of both
the property page and New Share dialog. Make sure the Help buttons are active
on all five ACL editor dialogs. (When we have a help file).

-- Make sure all keyboard mnemonics are unique, and that all controls have
appropriate mnemonics.

-- Make sure that choosing a share in the combo box, changing a parameter,
choosing another share in the combo box, changing one of its parameters works.
That is, switching between shares in the combo box should show the selected
share's data. Hit apply after these changes. Make sure the data got applied
correctly (use "net share" at the command line, or a separate API tool), and
that further switching between shares in the combo box still displays the
correct data.

-- In "New Share", type a share name that already exists. Get a pop-up and
choose "yes" to reuse the share name. Hit apply and be sure the old one went
away and the new one got created. Be sure the explorer "sharing hands" also
changed appropriately. Do the same test when creating a share directly on the
sharing page in "initial mode".

-- In the property page, delete a share that a user has a connection to.
Delete a share that a user has a connection to *and* a file open on. These are
two different scenarios that should pop up warnings when the user hits "apply".

-- In the explorer, delete, rename, and move (by drag/drop), a shared
directory. Make sure the sharing warning comes up. Do the same thing when
a user has a connection to the share. Do the same thing when a user has a
file open on the connection. These should bring up three different warning
scenarios. Do the same thing for a parent of a shared directory. Do the same
thing for a directory that has more than one shared child directory, each with
connections and open files.

-- Test the APIs

-- Stop the server (via "net stop server") between any two operations.
For instance, after bringing up the property sheet, and editing some items,
stop the server before hitting Apply.

-- Stop the server, then try to rename/delete/move a shared folder in the
explorer.

-- Bring up properties on a shared directory, stop the server, *hit F5 in the
explorer to refresh it, then try to apply share changes.

-- Stop the server, hit "F5" (refresh) in an explorer window to clear the
"sharing" hands, then start the server and hit F5 again to see the sharing
hands reappear.

This document will live with the code at \nt\private\windows\shell\lmui\ntshrui\ntshrui.doc. Shell Sharing The ntshrui.dll provides many sharing-related services, including the  Sharing  property page on all local folders. It also provides the IsPathSharedA/W API that the shell uses to determine whether a little sharing   should appear when it draws a folder. In addition, there are APIs used by the link tracking code and the FAX team, namely (1) SharingDialogA/W, for displaying a  Create share  dialog, and creating a share, and (2) GetNetResourceFromLocalPath and GetLocalPathFromNetResource, used so links to shared local directories can be used when the link is copied to another machine. The code is in \nt\private\windows\shell\lmui\ntshrui (ntshrui.dll). Win9x code that served as a (loose) template is the msshrui.dll code, found somewhere in the wnet project on \\trango\slm. This is currently stable with no bugs. Possible work items A decision was made to only allow share configuration on local directories. However, there has been quite a small uproar that we should do it remotely as well. We should reconsider our decision in light of whatever our post-NT 4.0 plans are. Code structure Files acl.cxx, acl.hxx -- Code to interface with the ACL editor api.cxx -- Most exported APIs live here app.def -- standard .def file app.rc -- resource file, eaten by VC++ app.rc2 -- 2nd resource file, for things VC++ shouldn t see cache.cxx, cache.hxx -- A C++ class that implements the share cache copyhook.cxx, copyhook.hxx -- The shell copy hook, to handle delete/rename/move of directories that are shared or that have children that are shared. critsec.hxx -- helper C++ class to implement automatic critical section acquire/release dlgbase.cxx, dlgbase.hxx -- base class for all dialogs. This is in common with other code I ve written, so I m just reusing it here. dlgnew.cxx, dlgnew.hxx -- the  New Share  dialog that appears from the  Sharing  property page. dlink.hxx -- a doubly-linked list implementation dllmain.cxx, dllmain.hxx -- the dll entrypoint. There is lots of code here to detect whether or not the server is running. guids.h -- GUIDs used by the OLE code. In particular, the shell extension interface uses OLE. headers.hxx -- the global pre-compiled header file helpids.h -- all help identifiers makefile, makefile.inc, sources -- standard NT build process stuff messages.mc -- most user-visible messages (some are in the .rc file) ntshrui.reg -- the  regini  file that is necessary for this stuff to run. This is just for documentation, as these entries are merged into the default hives. ole.cxx, ole.hxx -- all basic OLE code (AddRef/Release/QueryInterface, and class factories) is here resource.h -- all resource ids share.cxx, share.hxx -- shell property sheet and context menu extension class. shrinfo.cxx, shrinfo.hxx -- a class implementing an abstraction over lan man shares, level 502. This class inherits the linked-list class, so it is  linked-list ready . It is used for a list of share objects in the Sharing property page. shrpage.cxx, shrpage.hxx -- the Sharing property page dialog. strhash.cxx, strhash.hxx -- a hash table of string pointers. This is used to (hopefully) accelerate lookup of shares by directory, to speed up the shell display of a directory. util.cxx, util.hxx -- various utility functions. Description There are two main uses of this code. One is to provide a cache of shares for the shell, so it can call back asking whether to put a  sharing hand  on a directory. It does this by calling IsPathShared for each directory it displays. Since this is likely to be quite a few, this call must be very fast. It also must be thread-safe. The second use is to allow the sharing or un-sharing of any directory, by providing a Sharing property page. When the DLL loads, it first tries to initialize its cache of shares, by calling NetShareEnum with level 502. Note that this call requires both the server to be running and the user to have administrative priviledge on the machine. If the call fails, we spin off a thread to determine if the server isn t running now but might be running soon. This points out a current inefficiency: if the cache failed to fill because the user doesn t have administrative priviledge, we still spin off the thread and do this extra work. Anyway, we check the service controller, asking whether the server is started. If not, we ask if it is even configured to start, and if a start is pending. If it is configured to start, we wait to see if it begins starting. If a start is pending, we continue asking whether the start is complete, just like the  Services  control panel applet does. We give up after a while. If we can t initialize the cache for any reason, then no indication of sharing will be shown in the shell, and there will be no sharing configuration for directories. When initializing the cache, we get the SHARE_INFO_502 information and put it into a hash table where the hash key is the directory that is shared. Note that all access to the share cache is protected by a critical section. The Sharing property sheet is somewhat more complex than you might imagine at first glance. When initially sharing a directory, the  Share name  field is an edit control. When viewing the Sharing tab on a directory that is already shared, however, it is a drop-down list box. The information displayed and editable then relates to the currently selected element in the list box. When a directory is shared only once, the  New Share  button appears. When a directory is shared two or more times, the  Remove Share  button appears (which applies to the selected share). Note that no changes are  Issues There are several issues that could be addressed if necessary: The DLL currently only handles local sharing. It might be useful/necessary/nice to handle remote sharing as well. The DLL only handles NT Lan Manager sharing. This is somewhat inherited from Win95, and we didn t change it. In Win95, there is a  Sharing handler  DLL for each server. Since only one server can be running at a time, you just swap in the  Sharing handler  DLL for the particular server you are running. However, in NT you can run multiple servers at the same time. Unfortunately, we didn t update the sharing architecture to allow multiple servers to display their sharing in the shell. This really only affects the APIs, not the property sheet extension, which anybody can write. Since there is no   api for sharing (i.e., no api which routes among service providers), the shell calls the one, fixed IsPathShared API to determine if a directory is shared. We only consult the LanMan share cache. It might be nice to consult a service provider cache for each type of server, so that LanMan, NetWare, NFS, etc, all get their directories shown with  sharing hands Too many cache refreshes happen. This is partially the shell s fault for calling the refresh routine too often. In general, it might be useful to analyze the performance of this code. committed until either the  Apply Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Default Paragraph Font Body Text Title Subtitle Message Header  button is pressed. To handle this, we maintain a list of CShareInfo objects, each one representing a share. Each object has a state flag indicating it should be deleted, added, modified, or no change should be made when the shares are committed. It is somewhat complex to handle the two distinct cases of  no shares yet  and  at least one share at the start , and changing between them at apply time. There is one more complication: this same dialog, and dialog procedure, is used to put up a standalone dialog (not a property sheet) when the SharingDialog API is called.

This file contains random notes on the implementation of a shell name space
extension.

The shareui name space extension mostly independent of the shell, and only uses
a few shell interfaces that are internal, particularly the standard shell
folder view, using SHCreateShellFolderViewEx.

Menus
=================================================
Menus appear in several places:
1. Context-menus on a selection
2. Context-menu on the background
3. The menu bar, with a selection
4. The menu bar, with nothing selected

=======
For (1), the menu is:

    Delete
    ------
    Properties

and the default is Properties. Properties is grayed if there is more than one
item selected.

=======
For (2), the menu is the standard shell folder view menu, plus a "New" item:

    View
        Large Icons
        Small Icons
        List
        Details
    -------
    Arrange Icons
        by Name
        by Comment
        by Max Uses         -- only for administrators
        by Current Uses     -- only for administrators
        by Path             -- only for administrators
        -------
        Auto Arrange
    Line up Icons
    -------
    Paste                   -- always grayed
    Paste Shortcut          -- always grayed
    -------
    New
        Share

=======
For (3), the File menu should be:

    New
        Share
    -------
    Create Shortcut         -- always grayed
    Delete
    Rename                  -- always grayed
    Properties
    -------
    Close

and the View->Arrange Icons menu should be:

    by Name
    by Comment
    by Max Uses         -- only for administrators
    by Current Uses     -- only for administrators
    by Path             -- only for administrators
    -------
    Auto Arrange

As with (1), Properties will be the default, and will be grayed if the
selection includes more than one item.

=======
For (4), the File menu should be:

    New
        Share
    -------
    Create Shortcut         -- always grayed
    Delete                  -- grayed
    Rename                  -- always grayed
    Properties              -- grayed
    -------
    Close

and the View->Arrange Icons menu should be the same as in (3).

=======
The implementation for these various menus occurs in several different places
and should be synchronized to make sure the menus all do the same thing.

Case (1) is implemented by the shell calling IShellFolder::GetUIObjectOf asking
for IContextMenu.

Case (2) is implemented by the shell calling IShellFolder::CreateViewObject
asking for IContextMenu.

Case (3) is implemented by the shell calling IShellFolder::GetUIObjectOf asking
for IContextMenu. The context-menu is created. Also, the ...?

Case (4) is implemented as follows. When a shell folder view created using
SHCreateShellFolderViewEx is created, it calls back the passed-in callback
function with the message DVM_MERGEMENU. At this point, the background menus
are created.

The IContextMenu interfaces are also invoked for other uses, namely performing operations from the toolbar. The toolbar calls IShellFolder::GetUIObjectOf
asking for IContextMenu when it needs to call properties or delete an item.
It calls IContextMenu::InvokeCommand with string commands "delete" or
"properties" in these cases.

The ShareUI shell extension introduces a "Shared Folders" item into the
My Computer view. Opening this folder displays a list of all the
Microsoft Windows Network shares on the machine. That is, all the folders
on the machine shared on the Microsoft Windows Network.

Users with basic permission can view the names and comments of the
shares, but can't view other more detailed information such as the
path that is shared and the maximum number of users allowed
concurrently on the share. These users also can't make any
alterations to the share properties.

Users with administrative privilege can view and change the share name,
path, comment, user limit, and permissions. A context-menu on share objects
gives "Delete" and "Properties" commands (these are also available from
the toolbar). You can select multiple shares and delete them all at once.
Getting a context-menu on the background and choosing "New->Share" displays
a dialog from which you can create new shares.

*****Where it's at.
The reduced-fat deskmovr that is part of shdocvw implements the Beta-1 functionality.
There are two ActiveX controls which work together to provide a move and a size handle
for components on the active desktop. These controls are added to the desktop html file
as OBJECT tags by the deskhtml code via the deskmovr.htx template file. There are a dozen
bugs RAIDed against these controls which are divided between drag perf/flicker bugs and
miscellaneous quiet failures and work items.

*****Where it's going.
The new UI under design by ChristoB and MarkEn involves substantial changes to the
appearance and operation of the deskmovr. The two handles are replaced by a frame
and caption bar, which in turn has buttons to 'close' the component and provide a menu.

The basics of the new UI are checked-in under #ifdef NEWVO_UI. The frame-like affordances appear
and allow the components, both windowed and not, to be moved and resized. The #ifdef code
reads a bunch of PARAMs that tell it what system metrics to use for size and color of the
frame and caption.


*****What needs to happen for it to get the rest of the way there.
Resolve painting/flickering bugs. These may be tied to Trident. GaryBu and DinarteM could help.
Resolve z-ordering bugs. The zIndex style attribute isn't working as expected. LyleC could help.
	Once this is under control, the click-on-caption==bring-to-front can be implemented. Need deskhtml
	support for this. The code formerly known as DeskHTML.dll will need to add zIndex
	style attributes to the desktop components.
Add close box. Need help from deskhtml.dll to make this work.
Add menu. Work here is a function of how much ChristoB puts in the menu. Restore to original size
	will require help from deskhtml.dll.
Porting to CShellOcx, or whatever.
Remove DeskSizr.cpp/.h from build. With the new UI, it is no longer necessary. It can be dropped from the build
	and removed from the class factory table in sccls.c
With the NEWVO_UI, the notion of a "partner" control is obsolete. The m_pidmPartner and 
    m_pidsPartner members, the get_Engaged and GrabYourPartner methods, and the SizrID
    PARAM are unnecessary.
Multi-monitor stuff. Unknown at this point, but the window-frame UI should behave consistently with real
	windows in a multi-monitor environment.
Need deskhtml to name= components by whether they are windowed ( IFRAMEs ) or windowless ( IMG, DIV ).
	The TargetName params of the OBJECTs below should match the names deskhtml assigns.
This will allow the windowed and windowless instances of the control to target appropriately. 
	deskmovr.htx update. The object tags below replace the ones in shell\ext\html\construc\deskmovr.htx.
	After the coloring and metrics are nailed down, most of the new params can go away

When you hit an assert when shutting down IE, it means we have some
memory leak. It does not necessarily mean YOU have introduced some
new memory leak. In order to verify, please run following pre-check-in
tests. If it does not hit the same Assert, it means you haven't introduced
any memory leak in the following code path.

Test I:
1. Start Run "{c:\windows\system}\blank.htm"
2. Select File->New Window
3. Close Both

Test II:
1. Start Run "http://ohserv"
2. Click a link to "Development BVT"
3. Click the go back button

there is an erroneous assertion for a CUrlHistory object.  it gets freed
after the assertion on MSHTML process detach.  this will be fixed post IE3 ship

README.1ST:


                   MIME64 Encoder/Decoder

WHAT MIME64 IS:  MIME64 is an encoding described in RFC1341 as MIME base64.
Its purpose is to encode binary files into ASCII so that they may be passed
through e-mail gates.  In this regard, MIME64 is similar to UUENCODE.
Although most binaries these days are transmitted using UUENCODE, I
have seen a few using MIME64, and I have had requests from friends that
I decode MIME64 files that have fallen into their hands.  As long as
some MIME64 continues to exist, a package such as this one is useful
to have.


WHAT THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS:  This package contains both executable
and ANSI-C source code for a MIME64 encoder/decoder (MIME.EXE and
MIME.C respecively).  It also contains this README file, and a MIME64
encoded file called MIME.64.  The latter will decode to MIME.ZIP if
you issue the DOS command line:

   MIME64 MIME.64 MIME.ZIP

If you unzip the zip file, you will get an essay by Mark Grand about
MIME.


HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE:  To decode a MIME64 file you may type:

   MIME64 infile outfile

If you leave out the outfile specification, the output file will
overwrite the input file.

To encode a file into MIME64 format, type:

   MIME64 infile outfile -e

Again, if you leave off the outfile specification, the output will
overwrite the input.


STATUS OF THIS PACKAGE:  This package is freeware.  As author, I
claim no copyright.  If you change the source code and intend to
propogate that change to other users, please include a comment to
that effect at the top that states:  The date of the change, the
nature of the change, and who made the change.  As a courtesy, I also
ask that you retain the comment that acknowledges me as the original
author.

BUG #1 (Word95): IPersistFile::Load disables open-in-place

    Bug: When you bind to a WordDocument via file moniker, activating it
         as a DocObject will open it in the Word application window. This
         is caused by an internal flag, which is set by IPersistFile::Load.

    Work-around: Call SetHostName() after IPersistFile::Load, which will
         reset this internal flag.

BUG #2 (Word 95): Word does not call IPersistStorage::Save when saving.

    Bug: Word95 does not call IPersistStorage::Save when I insert a new shell
         embedding and select File->Save(). Here is the calling sequence.

Guidelines for adding code to shlwapi.dll
-----------------------------------------

Shlwapi is considered to be the repository for shared utility code in IE.
We do not want it to be a dumping ground. Also, the lw in shlwapi indicates
that it is intended to be light weight. Hence follow these guidelines

1. Make sure that it is indeed a utility function - others will want to use it.
2. Document the utility function with comments in your source file.
3. Tell other groups about the existence of these new utility functions. 
Preferably, identify modules that can be trimmed by using these utilities and do 
the trimming yourself.
4. Defer all initialization for your API-Set until one of these APIs is first called.
We do not want the loading of shlwapi.dll to introduce a large burden on the shell.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\shell\sld\build\readme.txt ===
I'm going to use the example of our Shell__Core.SLD file for this discussion, but you can replace all instances of "ShellCore" below with "DirectMusic" or "DirectShow" quite easily.
 
1) Annotate hivecls.inx, hivesft.inx, hivedef.inx with "@*:;begin_sld_ShellCore"/"@*:;end_sld_ShellCore" around the registry entries you want to include.  Note that these are prodfilt comment lines, so they have no effect on the actual hivecls.inf, hivesft.inf, hivedef.inf files generated for the core product.
2) Create a special SLD build directory and add "SLDFILES = ShellCore" and add "MISCFILES = $(SLDFILES)" to your Sources file.
3) In your makefile, !INCLUDE "makefile.sld" in addition to makefile.def
4) Building in this directory will generate ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf, ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings_ADS.inf (iff there are server-only settings), and ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings_PRO.inf (iff there are pro-only settings).
5) Take the generated inf files and use INF2SLD to convert them to .SLD files. (NOTE: once the new componentization tools are released this step can be automated -- eta 2 Sept.)
6) Check this ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf.SLD in right next to the Shell__Core.SLD file.  Note: the first time you do this, you need to add a registry key raw dependency in Shell__Core.SLD to one of the registry keys in ShellCore_Generated_Regsettings.inf.SLD so you suck in the generated file whenever the original component is selected.


To get auto-build-machine support to let you know when someone changed a .inf line that requires you to update your .sld files, do this:
1) Copy the generated obj\i386\*.inf to .\*.inf and check them in.
2) Have your auto build machine build in the special SLD generation directory.
3) Whenever you get a build error, someone changed an .inf file without updating the .sld files.  Start at step 5 above.


Whenever you get a bug about a missin registry line from hiveXXX.inf, simply update your annotations and re-run the makefile.


Please let me know of any bugs you find with this process.


Thanks,

Theme Aware Controls - 08/03/00
-------------------------------

HOW TO MAKE CONTROLS/WINDOWS THEME AWARE

Here are the high-level steps needed to make a control theme-aware:
    
    Preparation

        a. The control author decides which aspects of the control will be 
           theme aware.  
           
        b. He then divides the control up into 1 or more 
           named theme-aware child parts (drawn shapes with optional text).  

        c. For each part, the author can define 1 or more background images 
           in a single bitmap file.  These difference backgrounds are usually
           associated with different states in the control but don't have to 
           be.  At run time, the appropriate image can be selected using an 
           "iStateId" value as the 1-based index to the correct image.
         
        d. alternatively, the author can decide the create the background based 
           on a border color/style/size and a fill color/style.

        e. other ways of rendering may be defined in the future; try to keep
           your control as isolated as possible from the particular theme properties
           and try to use the theme drawing API's exclusively.

        f. the control author then publishes the theme schema for his control.  If the control is 
           part of comctrls v6, then the schema is added to the file "TmSchema.h"; otherwise,
           the control creates his own "xxxSchema.h" file (which needs to get compiled into
           his control as well as registered with the theme manager).

        g. add schema info:

            - he adds a parts enum to the schema file; ex:

                BEGIN_TM_CLASS_PARTS(EDIT)
                    TM_PART(EP, EDITTEXT)
                    TM_PART(EP, CARET)
                END_TM_CLASS_PARTS()

            - for each part that has more than 1 state, he adds a state enum:

                BEGIN_TM_PART_STATES(EDITTEXT)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, NORMAL)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, HOT)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, SELECTED)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, DISABLED)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, FOCUSED)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, READONLY)
                    TM_STATE(ETS, ASSIST)
                END_TM_PART_STATES()
                    
        h. note that once "TmSchema.h" has been edited, the "\nt\shell\published\inc" directory
           must be built so that the "TmSchema.h" file is copied to "\nt\public\sdk\inc".

    Code Changes

        a. obtain an HTHEME handle to call thememgr drawing routines with.  this should 
               be done during control creation (as soon as the "hwnd" is available).
               The code for the button control would look something like this:

               HTHEME hTheme;
               hTheme = OpenThemeData(hwnd, L"button");
               if (! hTheme)        // fall back on old drawing code...
               {
               }

        b. when its time to paint one of the parts of the control:
        
                i.  first initialize the control's DC; most controls send a WM_CTLCOLORXXX
                    msg to their parent to do this.  Use the HBRUSH returned from the WM_CTLCOLORXXX
                    msg as the DefaultBrush passed to the theme drawing routines.


                ii. pass "hTheme" and the DefaultBrush to the theme drawing routines to paint 
                    the background, text, line, border, etc.  The routines will ensure that the 
                    painting is done in a theme-compliant way.  

               The code for drawing the a push button background would look something like:

                //---- initialize the DC & get DefaultBrush ----
                HBRUSH hDefaultBrush = (HBRUSH)SendMessage(GetParent(hwnd), WM_CTLCOLORBTN, (WPARAM)hdc, (LPARAM)hwnd);

                if (hTheme)
                {            
                    int iStateId;

                    if (fPushed)
                        iStateId = 4;
                    else if (fDisabled)
                        iStateId = 3;
                    else if (fMouseOver)
                        iStateId = 2;
                    else if (fDefault)
                        iStateId = 1;
                    else
                        iStateId = 0;

                    //---- DrawThemeBackground doesn't yet accept the hDefaultBrush param ----
                    hr = DrawThemeBackgound(hTheme, hdc, TMT_BUTTON, iStateId, &clientRect, 0);
                 }
                 else           // old drawing code
                 {
                 }
                
        c. when a WM_THEMECHANGED msg is received by the control/window, it must close its
           current HTMEME handle, try to obtain a new handle, and repaint its control.  
           The code would look something like:

                   CloseThemeData(hTheme);
                   hTheme = OpenThemeData(hwnd, L"BUTTON");
                   InvalidateRect(hwnd, NULL, TRUE);
                    

        d.  The ThemeRender object should be able to handle most or all of the 
            drawing for the control.  However, when the control needs to access 
            some theme information directly, the programmer can pass the "hTheme"
            handle to one of the theme info "getter" routines.  For example, the 
            code to get the FONT for a part would look something like:

                if (hTheme)
                {
                    LOGFONT *pFont;
                    hr = GetThemeFont(hTheme, TMBU_BUTTON, 0, pvFONT, &pFont);
                    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
                    {
                        <use the pFont here...>
                    }
                }
                 
        e.  Since its possible that the control's main background may contain 
            transparent parts, the programmer will need to handle the WM_NCHITTEST msg 
            processing.  The code would look something like this:

            
                if ((msg == WM_NCHITTEST) && (hTheme))
                {
                    int val = DefWindowProc(msg, hwnd, wparam, lparam);
                    if (val == HTCLIENT)        // test further
                    {
                        BOOL fHit;
                        hr = HitTestThemeBackground(hTheme, hdc, TMBU_BUTTON, 0, iStateIndex, 
                            &clientRect, &fHit);
                        if ((SUCCEEDED(hr)) && (! fHit))
                            val = HTTRANSPARENT;
                    }

                    return val;
                }

        f.   The programmer needs to be aware that being themed can change the size of 
             various parts.  For example, a background that used to have a 2-pixel border 
             around it may now use a 6-pixel border.  The programmer should use methods 
             like "GetThemeBackgroundContentRect()" to determine which parts of the background 
             content can be put into and "GetThemeTextExtent()" to find out how much space 
             the text needs in its theme-selected font.

;   NTL - Native Theme Language - 07/10/00
;-----------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------

An .ntl file describes the brushes, lines, rectangles, curves,
and shapes needed to draw control parts.

The .ntl file is uses the standard Windows .ini file format with multiple
sections and multiple "property = value" lines within each section.

There are 2 section types supported:

    [OptionBits] - used to declare the option bit names/mappings used by the
                   drawing sections

    [Drawing(xxx)] - used to describe how to draw the state named "xxx"


OptionBits Section:
-------------------

The [OptionBits] section contains properties lines of the form:

    <name> = <number>

The <name> declares an option bit, whose bit number is specified by <number>.  These 
options bits are passed by the theme-aware control in the lower 16 bits of the last DWORD 
param to DrawThemeBackground().

Once an optionbit is declared, its value can be tested by an "if" property in the [Drawing.xxx]
sections.


Drawing Sections:
-----------------

There are 3 types of drawing that can be done in a drawing section.  A section can contain one
or more of these but each type should complete before the next type starts.

   1. Collapsing Border drawing
   
      In this mode, successive outer borders of a certain color, width, and height are drawn
      from the original rectangle specified for the control part inward, towards the center
      of the part.  Properties allowed in this mode are:

        AddBorder = SIZE <size4> COLOR <color4>

        FillBorder = COLOR <color>
        FillBorder = IMAGEFILE <imagefile>
        FillBorder = NONE

      Notes:
        - "FillRect" fills the adjusted rectangle with the specified color or 
          by tiling the specified bitmap

   2. FreeHand drawing

        In this mode, we describe a brush and then can move, paint lines, and paint curves.  There
        is no filling involved.  The x,y point coordinates range from 0-1000, unless the 
        "LogicalRect" property is specified to overrides them.  These points are mapped at runtime
        to the part's actual rectangle.  
        
        Properties allowed in this mode are:

        LogicalRect = RECT <rect>

        FillBrush = COLOR <color>
        FillBrush = IMAGEFILE <imagefile>
        FillBrush = NONE

        LineBrush = COLOR <color> SIZE <size1>
        LineBrush = NONE

        MoveTo = POINT <point>
        LineTo = POINT <point>
        CurveTo = CP1 <point> CP2 <point> POINT <point>

   3. Filled Shape drawing
   
      In this mode, we describe a line brush and a fill brush and then describe the lines
      and curves of the shape.  After the border of the shape is drawn with the
      line brush, it is filled with the fill brush.  Properties allowed in this mode are:
      
        Shape = POINT <point>

            FillBrush = COLOR <color>
            FillBrush = IMAGEFILE <imagefile>
            FillBrush = NONE

            LineBrush = COLOR <color> SIZE <size1>
            LineBrush = NONE

            LogicalRect = RECT <rect>

            LineTo = POINT <point>
            CurveTo = CP1 <point> CP2 <point> POINT <point>

        EndShape = POINT <point>

        Notes: 
            - A Shape subsection must start with a "Shape" property and end with a
              "EndShape" property

            - "LineBrush" and "FillBrush" can only be specified once and must be the
              first 2 properties after "Shape". 


There are also some general properties that can appear anywhere in a section (with the exception of
"GotoState", which if used, must be placed at the end of a section).  These properties are:

    if = <option bit name> (on)
    if = <option bit name> (off)
    
    else = <option bit name> (on)
    else = <option bit name> (off)

    endif = <option bit name>

    SetOption = <option bit name> (on)
    SetOption = <option bit name> (off)

    GotoState = <state name>

Note: when an "else" property is used, it must match the most recent, unmatched "if" property
and have the opposite on/off setting.

Each "if" property must be matched with an "endif" property of the same 
<option bit name>.


Parameters:
-----------

    <imagefile>
        ::= [ INDEX <number> ]

    <color>
        ::= <red number> <green number> <blue number>

    <point>
        ::= <x number> <y number>

    <rect>
        ::= <left number> <top number> <right number> <bottom number>

Theme Schema File - 07/20/00
----------------------------

    1. Description: the theme schema file is a "C" header file that uses special macros defined by
       the file "SchemaDef.h"
       
    2. The system schema file (for uxtheme.dll and comctl32.dll) is named "TmSchema.h".

    3. Purpose: the schema file defines a common set of enums, properties, class parts, and class states
       to be shared between the Theme Manager drawing/info routines, the theme authoring file, and the
       theme-aware controls

    4. File layout:
    

        a. file start
            - the first part of the file contains some fixed information:
            
                //-----------------------------------------------------------------
                #if (defined(SCHEMA_STRINGS)) || (! defined(TMSCHEMA_H))
                //-----------------------------------------------------------------
                #define TMSCHEMA_H
                //-----------------------------------------------------------------
                #include "SchemaDef.h"
                //-----------------------------------------------------------------
                #define THEMEMGR_VERSION 1  // increment if order of props changes or 
                                            // any props are deleted (will prevent loading
                                            // of controlsets that use older version
                //-----------------------------------------------------------------
                BEGIN_TM_SCHEMA(xxx)            
                
          (where "xxx" is the schema name)


        b. enums section 
            - this section contains one or more enum definitions

            - each enum definition defines an enum name and a set of named values

            - example:
        
                BEGIN_TM_ENUM(BGTYPE)
                    TM_ENUM(BT, IMAGEFILE)
                    TM_ENUM(BT, BORDERFILL)
                    TM_ENUM(BT, NTLFILE)
                END_TM_ENUM()

               The above example declares an enum called "BGTYPE".  It has 3 named
               values: IMAGEFILE (value=0), BORDERFILL (value=1), and NTLFILE (value=2)

        c. properties section
            - this section defines a set of properties based on the primitive
              property types or a previously declared enum

            - section starts with the line:
                    BEGIN_TM_PROPS()

            - section ends with the line:
                    END_TM_PROPS()

            - example property:

                TM_PROP(TMT, BORDERSIZE,        INT)     
                
               (declares a "BorderSize" property of type "int")


            - example property:

                TM_PROP(TMT, BGTYPE,           ENUM)

                (declares a "BgType" property of type enum)


        d. parts/states section
            - this section contains one or more parts/states declarations

            - example:

                BEGIN_TM_CLASS_PARTS(BUTTON)
                    TM_PART(BP, PUSHBUTTON)
                    TM_PART(BP, RADIOBUTTON)
                    TM_PART(BP, CHECKBOX)
                    TM_PART(BP, GROUPBOX)
                    TM_PART(BP, USERBUTTON)
                END_TM_CLASS_PARTS()

                (the above defines a class called "button" that
                has the 5 specified parts)


            - example:

                BEGIN_TM_PART_STATES(PUSHBUTTON)
                    TM_STATE(PBS, NORMAL)
                    TM_STATE(PBS, HOT)
                    TM_STATE(PBS, PRESSED)
                    TM_STATE(PBS, DISABLED)
                    TM_STATE(PBS, DEFAULTED)
                END_TM_PART_STATES()

                (the above defines a part called "pushbutton" that has 
                the 5 specified states)

        e. file ending

        - this section should look like:

                    END_TM_SCHEMA(xxx)          
                //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                #endif      // TMSCHEMA_H
                //---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        (where "xxx" is the schema name)


    5. The system schema file (TmSchema.h) is compiled into:

        - uxtheme.dll   (theme manager code)
        
        - comctl32.dll  (common controls code)
        
        - packthem.exe  (theme packaging utility)
        
        - <theme-aware custom controls>


    6. custom controls can define their own schema file that extend the system schema.  This 
       schema file should be compiled into the control's DLL and the DLL should be registered
       as "Path" values under the registry key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ThemeManager\CustomControls

        example:   Path = "c:\program files\acme\keypad.dll"

    
    7. during theme packaging, the "packthem.exe" will attempt to call each registered DLL to get its
       schema info.  This call is automatically implemented when the schema file is built using the
       format described in this document.


    8. uxtheme.dll will also load registered control DLL's for the schema during every theme load

Windows Themes .INI Files - 05/10/00
------------------------------------

    1. A theme .ini file is a standard Windows .ini file.  All text is compared 
       case-insensitive.  The File can be created in either ANSI or UNICODE 
       character sets.

    2. Types and names of theme files

        - there are 2 types of theme .ini files:

            - themes.ini        - specifies available color schemes and sizes for a theme
            - classdata file    - contains theme data for specific size/color

    3. primitive property values

        - below is the list of primitive property types and their associated
          value format

        - when values have multiple parts, the parts can be separated by
          optional commas

        - value parts must be listed in the order described unless the optional
          partnames are used (format: partname:value)

    4. primitive property types (10):

        - string  (any text to right of "='; no quotes)

        - int     (signed integer or hex number)

        - bool    (one of the values: "true" or "false")

        - color   (comma-sep. list of 3 numbers.  partnames: "r", "g", "b")

        - enum    (a string value that gets matched to a declared enum)
        
        - margins   (a comma-sep. list of 4 int's.  partnames: "lw", "rw", "th", "bh"
                    note: these can be negative & control spacing of odd-shaped images)

        - filename  (a relative path that gets fully qualified; currently cannot contain
                    spaces or quotes; filenames are relative to the theme's directory)

        - size      (an integer followed by optional "twips", "pixels", or "points")
                    (the default size units is "pixels")

        - position  (a comma-sep. list of 2 int's.  partnames: "x", "y".
                    interpreted as pixels)

        - rect      (a comma-sep. list of 4 int's.  partnames: "l", "t", "r", "b")

        - font      (familyname, size, fontflags.  familyname can contain spaces)

                        ex:  arial, 10      (the default font units is "points")
                        ex:  ms san serif, 18 pixels, bold italic
                  

    5. there are a number of predefined enums and property names (based on primitive types);
       refer to the file "TmSchema.h" for a current and complete list

    6. all theme files consists of 1 or more sections.  each section contains 
       1 or more property-setting lines of the form:

        <name> "=" <value>

    7. <property names>

        - for the "<name> = "<value>" lines within the any section except the [documentation] section,
          <name> is required to be a primative name, a predefined enum name, or a predefined type.

            - examples:
                - ImageFile
                - SizingMargins
                - myPredefinedStringName

        - this hard "typing" of property names gives us some parsing services at file load time
          and helps standardize the name of recurring properties.

        - a list of which property names apply to each drawing routine can be found in Appendix B.


    8. Sections allowed in "themes.ini" files:

        - [documentation] section
        - [Size.xxx] sections
        - [ColorScheme.xxx] sections
        - [File.xxx] sections

        - the "documentation" section is optional
        - at least one occurance of each of the "size", "ColorScheme", and "file" 
          sections are required

    9. [documentation] section:

        - any property name can go here; unrecognized property names are ignored without generating
          errors

        - all properties in the [documentation] section are interpreted as string properties
       
        - certain properties in this section are recognized and used by the theme selection UI.  these 
          properties are also written to a string table in the packed theme file, for localization
          access.  the recognized properties are:
          
            - DisplayName
            - ToolTip
            - Author
            - Company
            - Copyright
            - URL
            - Version
            - Description
            
    10. [ColorScheme.xxx] section:

        - the "xxx" should be replaced the simple color scheme name (no spaces)

        - the first [ColorScheme.xxx] section in the "themes.ini" file is the 
          default Color Scheme (for UI selection)
        
        - the property names recognized in a [ColorScheme.xxx] section are:
                  
                  - DisplayName     (UI name for this color scheme choice)
                  - ToolTip         (tooltip text for this color scheme choice)

                  - FromColor1 (thru FromColor5)   
                  - ToColor1 (thru ToColor5)

                  - FromHue1 (thru FromHue5)
                  - ToHue1 (thru ToHue5)

        - each color scheme is a set of transformations on the explicit
          color values and the colors contained in each image of associated 
          classdata files
          
        - For example, the following sections specifies 3 color schemes:
        
                [ColorScheme.Bright]
                DisplayName "Bright Colors"
                FromColor1 = 128 0 0 
                ToColor1 = 255 0 0 

                [ColorScheme.Dark]
                DisplayName = "Dark Colors"
                FromColor1 = 128 0 0 
                ToColor1 = 25 0 0

                [ColorScheme.Random]
                DisplayName = "Wierd, Random Colors"
                Tooltip = "Caution: this is a dev-authored color scheme"
                FromColor1 = 128 0 0 
                ToColor1 = 255 3 32
                
        - an empty set of transformations can be used to name the normal, untransformed color
          scheme.  this could be used by a file for its default color scheme or a file that
          doesn't support color scheme transformations (where each color scheme is implemented
          as a separate classdata file).  Examples:

            [ColorScheme.Default]
            DisplayName = "Default"

            [ColorScheme.RedDesign]
            DisplayName = "Fall Reds"


    11. [Size.xxx] section:

        - the "xxx" should be replaced the simple size name (no spaces)
        
        - the first [Size.xxx] section in the "themes.ini" file is the 
          default Size (for UI selection)

        - the property names recognized in a [Size.xxx] section are:
                  
                  - DisplayName
                  - ToolTip

        - the "DisplayName" property will be the name of the size in the UI to select a theme

        - the "ToolTip" property specifies the tooltip text to be used in the theme
          selection UI for this size

        - For example, the following sections specifies 3 sizes:
        
                [Sizes.Default]
                DisplayName = "Default"

                [Sizes.Small]
                DisplayName = "Very Small"
                Tooltip = "Choose this if you like to squint"

                [Sizes.Large]
                DisplayName = "Very Large"
                

    12. [File.xxx] section:

        - the "xxx" should be replaced a simple, unique name for the classdata file (no spaces)

        - the propertes recognized in this section are:
                  
                  - Filename        (to name the classdata file)

                  - ColorSchemes    (to specify the list of color schemes 
                                     that the file supports)

                  - Sizes           (to specify the sizes that the file supports)

    
        - Examples:
        
                [File.One]
                Filename = large.ini
                ColorSchemes = default, red, green, blue
                Sizes = Large

                [File.Two]
                Filename = smallred.ini
                ColorSchemes = red
                Sizes = Small

        - the "ColorSchemes" property must specify a comma separated list of previously
          declared simple color scheme names (from [ColorScheme.xxx] sections)

        - the "Sizes" property must specify a comma separated list of previously
          declared simple size names (from [Size.xxx] sections)

        - the lists can be continued on multiple lines by starting the continued line
          with an equals sign ("=")

        - each unique color/size combination can only be associated with one file

    13. Sections allowed in "classdata" files:

        - [globals] section
        - [sysmetrics] section
        - class sections

        - all sections are optional
        - multiple class sections allowed
        - if used, the [globals] section must be the first section
        - if used, the [sysmetrics] section must appear before any class sections

    14. [globals] section:

        - the globals section is a list of <property name> settings that are inherited by each parent class 
          section.  the class section can overwrite any of the properties set in the global section.  At runtime,
          a control can use the "GetPropertyOrigin()" to determine if the property is specified locally,
          in the parent node, globally, or not at all.

        - the "CharSet" property, which specifies the numeric character set for all fonts in the 
          classdata file, has the following special rules:

                - can only appear in the [globals] section

                - must appear before the first "Font" property setting

    15. [sysmetrics] section:

        - this section allows a theme author to set the system metrics when the theme is loaded
          so that the look of non-themed applications can be made to more closely match the look 
          of the theme.

        - for this section, the "appname::" option is not allowed

        - for this section, the ".partid" option is not allowed

        - the supported system metrics are:

            - system colors
                Scrollbar, Background, ActiveCaption, InactiveCaption, Menu
                Window, WindowFrame, MenuText, WindowText, CaptionText
                ActiveBorder, InactiveBorder, AppWorkSpace, Highlight, HighlightText
                BtnFace, BtnShadow, GrayText, BtnText, InactiveCaptionText
         	BtnHighlight, DkShadow3d, Light3d, InfoText, InfoBk, ButtonAlternateFace, HotTracking
                GradientActiveCaption, GradientInactiveCaption, MenuBar, MenuHilight

            - system fonts
                CaptionFont, SmallCaptionFont, MenuFont, StatusFont, MsgBoxFont
                IconTitleFont

            - system sizes
                BorderWidth, ScrollBarWidth, ScrollBarHeight, CaptionBarWidth, CaptionBarHeight
                SmCaptionBarWidth, SmCaptionBarHeight, MenuBarWidth, MenuBarHeight 

            - system booleans
                FlatMenus,  DropShadows, MouseVanish, CursorShadow
                TooltipFade, TooltipAnimation, SelectionFade

            - system strings
                CssName, XmlName

        - only the above property names are allowed in this section

        - if any values of any of the above system metrics are not specifed, they 
          default to the system setting for the "Windows Standard" scheme.


    16. class sections:

        - the section name for class sections is consists of 1-4 names, as shown below.  Each
          name can contain 1 or more the following chars: letters, numbers, "-", and "_").
          
            a. (optional) group name followed by a "::"
               (the "group name" is the base name of an application for the OpenThemeData() API 
               but can also be any logical grouping name when passed by the SetWindowTheme() API).

            b. the windows classname or user-created name 

            c. (optional) a "." followed by a child part name.  Note: the child 
                part name must be defined as a part name for its class in the "TmSchema.h" file

            d. (optional) a state named enclosed in parenthesis.  Note: the 
                state name must be defined as a state name for its part int the 
                "TmSchema.h" file

        - examples:

                [button]                    // simple class name

                [button-OK]                 // specialized class name

                [explorer::button]          // only applies to buttons in "explorer"

                [button.pushbutton]         // a part of button called "pushbutton"

                [button.pushbutton(up)]     // the "up" state of pushbuton

                [button(disabled)]          // the "disabled" state of button

        - there are some special predeclared names that are not registered class names but are recognized
          by the theme code as appropriate:
          
            - dialog    (for dialog frame/backgrounds)
            - menu      (for uxcontrol menus)
            - desktop   (for desktop wallpaper)
            - nonclient (for captioned window frames)

        - child sections inherit from their parent section of the same name.  at runtime, 
          each API for the theme drawing & information take a PartId (int) to select the parent 
          or child section.  

        - state sections inherit from their parent class or part section of the same name.  
          at runtime,  each API for theme drawing & information take a PartId (int) to 
          select the state of the part or class.

        - these state, part, and parent class sections contain, together with the 
          inherited "globals" section, all of the properties values needed to draw 
          the specified window class (see section 7 on <property names>).

        - a list of the standard controls/windows, along with which drawing services they
          use, can be found in Appendix C.

    17. applications that don't want to apply the current Theme

        - applications that want to have no theme-effects on their controls or who want to specify another
          theme will have put this info into the registry under the "ThemeManager" key.  More details to follow on 
          this.

Theme Authoring Kit - 7/26/00
            -----------------------------

The Theme Authoring Kit (TAK) is an informal (internal use only) collection 
of tools to help theme authors build new "visual styles" for Whistler.

TAK consists of the following:

    1. themesel.exe         (theme testing program - see below)
    
    2. packthem.exe         (packages theme files into a .mstheme DLL)
    
    3. tools needed for running packtheme.exe:
    
        - rc.exe            (resource compiler)
        - link.exe          (linker; used to build dll)
        - rcdll.exe         (used by rc.exe)
        - cvtres.exe        (used by link.exe)
        - mspdb60.dll       (used by link.exe)
    
    4. Sample theme Directories:
    
        - Business
        - BusSolid
        - BusDev

    5. Informal documentation:

        - schema.txt    (explains format/use of "TmSchema.h" file)
        - themes.txt    (explains format/use of .ini files for themes)
        - tak.txt       (this file)
        - skeming.ppt   (a powerpoint intro to themes)

    6. misc files:
    
        - TmSchema.h    (schema file)
        - SchemaDef.h   (schema helper file)
        - uxtheme.h     (public api for theme-aware controls)
        - uxthemep.h    (internal-only api for theme selection UI)


Manually Switching Themes:
--------------------------

Until the real theme switching UI is ready, you can turn themes ON/OFF 
(and switch themes) by manually editing the registry:

To turn the business "visual style" ON:

    a. shut down explorer (Start | Shut down | hold CTRL+ALT+Shift and click on the cancel button)

    b. run: regedit

    c. navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion

    d. add KEY: ThemeManager

    e. add string value to ThemeManager key:

		string: ThemeActive
		value: 1

    f. add string value to ThemeManager key: 

		string: DllName
		value: %windir%\resources\0409\themes\business\business.mstheme

    g. close "regedit"

    h. run: explorer   

    i. verfiy that taskbar has a new start button, smaller text, etc.  

The file "themeon.reg" automates the above steps.  You can run in using "start themeon.reg"

    
To turn the business "visual style" OFF:

    a. shut down explorer (Start | Shut down | hold CTRL+ALT+Shift and click on the cancel button)

    b. shut down any other programs running (this is a temp. requirement)

    c. run: regedit

    d. navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\ThemeManager

    e. change the value of the "ThemeActive" string to "0"

    f. close "regedit"

    g. run: explorer
