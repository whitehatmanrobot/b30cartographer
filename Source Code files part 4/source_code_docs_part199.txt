The Build Utility provides a structured way of building things. This is the default build process for Windows\~NT. Groups who use it enable the Windows\~NT group to be able to build with their group and to make changes to the group\rquote  s source files when needed. Other groups, such as the VC team, use the Build Utility for precisely this reason. Even though the VC team did not need the same multi-platform support for their build process as the build process for Windows\~ NT needed, the Build Utility enabled them to override all the default settings for build.exe and still take advantage of Windows\~NT.  \par {\b See Also}\line {\uldb\cf11 Features}{\v Features}\line {\uldb\cf11 Why Use the Build Utility}{\v Why_use_the_Build_Utility}\line {\uldb\cf11 Where is the Build Utility Located}{\v Where_is_the_build_utility_located}\line {\uldb\cf11 Quick Start}{\v  Quick_Start} \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} Steve_Wood}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} Steve Wood}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} Steve Wood}} Steve Wood \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 Steve Wood was one of the initial ten people working on Windows\~NT. They knew that t hey were going to build something really, really big. Steve came from OS/2 where everyone used individual procedures for building products. In OS/2, there were the UI people, the base kernel people, and the net people, who all had their own way of doing t hings. The build was tremendously difficult to coordinate. If you went to one subdirectory, you built a certain way, but if you went to another subdirectory, you built a different way. There were people in different geographic locations, all of them makin g changes and none of them compatible with each other or working together. So Steve came from that environment and realized there was a need for something better. That\rquote s how the Build Utility came into being. \par The question Steve asked was how could he abstract out all of this complicated gobbeldy-gook and put it in a master file? Steve noticed that nmake itself does not have some of the functions needed to build Windows\~ NT: the ability to occasionally exclude directories or only build certain directories. He also wanted to have a way to have a global look at the whole tree for Windows\~ NT. If a file changed anywhere in the tree, the developers could easily answer the question: \ldblquote What do we have to rebuild as a result of that change?\rdblquote   \par One of the things the Build Utility does is create a master database of all the inter-dependencies in the tree. This means you can go to any subdirectory, make a change to a file, and check it in. Then you can go to the top of the build tree for Windows\~ NT, run build.exe, and anything in the tree that needs to be rebuilt, {\ul will} be rebuilt. You don\rquote t have to worry if you did the right thing. There would have been no way to build Windows\~NT without this type of structure and methodology. \par The Build Utility eliminates the requirement of testing every single release against every single platform. This requirement is not needed for Windows\~NT because Windows\~NT performs the same way on all platforms: Intel, Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC.  \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} Features}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} Features}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} Features}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} BEGIN:0}} Features \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 The Build Utility: \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}\pard \fi-360\li360\ri130\sa240\widctlpar\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnhang{\pntxtb \'b7}}Automatically establishes file dependencies. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}Provides tools to build products for multiple hardware platforms without specifying any target-specific information. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}Shields you from the details of the various compilers and machine architectures. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}Is multiprocessor aware for speedier compilation. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}Provides feedback during compilation, including: \line \line *  How much longer before the build will finish \line *  How many lines are compiling\line *  How fast it\rquote s compiling them\line  *  How many files you have to link\line *  How many targets you are creating \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}Provides detailed information about the build process. \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} Why_use_the_Build_Utility}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar  \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super $} Why use the Build Utility? }} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} Why use the Build Utility? }} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super +} BEGIN:0}} Why Use the Build Utility?  \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 The great benefit to using this Build Utility, rather than creating your own make or nmake files, is because: \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}\pard \fi-360\li360\ri130\sa240\widctlpar\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnhang{\pntxtb \'b7}} The Build Utility isolates all target-dependent information in a centralized location (including header and library include paths, compiler names and switches, and linker switches). \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}You can build products for multiple hardware platforms without specifying any target-specific information. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}The Build Utility ensures that everyone builds consistently. \line \line  This is important when you have multiple files to build, many .exe files that you are generating, and multiple developers working on a project, You never have to be specific places.

The Build Utility gives you the advantage of having a single subdirectory where you can build multiple executable output files. The Build Utility supports a library-linked-to-main model, whic h enables you to have one subdirectory that builds multiple targets that are very similar. This eliminates the need to move recursively through 10 different subdirectories to build 10 different .exe files when they are all pretty much the same except for  one source file that\rquote s different between them. \par In a single subdirectory you can have a number of files that share some common subset of code. Each of them will have a single source file that will have the unique code for that product. If your build product consists of several source files, you can spe cify all but the main source file as components of a library. The Build Utility links this library with the file containing main.  \par This model is especially useful in situations like in the tree for Windows\~NT tr ee where you have a subdirectory or in which you are building UNIX tools that all have a common file I/O code, memory code, and registry code. Then they also have a little wrapper around it that implements the name, which is the thing specific to that too l. What the Build Utility enables you to do is set up a target type of library in that subdirectory and use the use remote applications macro (UMAPPL) to specify the target names.  \par Consider, for example the simple UNIX commands tar, cat and grep:  \par \pard \li720\ri130\sa240\widctlpar UMAPPL=tar*cat*grep \par \pard \ri130\sa240\widctlpar  Put all your common source files in the SOURCES macro. The Build Utility compiles all of those into a library, then compiles each one of the individual source files for tar.c, cat.c, and grep.c and links each of those against the common library that you b uilt to produce tar.exe, cat.exe, and grep.exe. \par {\b See Also}\line {\uldb\cf11 UMAPPL}{\v UMAPPL}\line {\uldb\cf11 SOURCES}{\v SOURCES} \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} SOURCES_File}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} SOURCES File}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} SOURCES File}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} FILES:0}} sources File \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 You describe build products in a file named \ldblquote sources\rdblquote  that resides in each source code subdirectory.

It then recurses to each directory li sted where it might find another dirs file (indicating more directories to recurse into) or a sources file (indicating something needs to be built). If the latter, it looks for the macros SOURCES, INCLUDES, TARGETNAME, and TARGETPATH.  These are parsed to  determine the dependencies, the list of files to build, and the end result.  Normally, this information is then kept in a file called build.dat that the build utility will create for future reference.  Depending on the options you pass to build, it does  the appropriate action and then calls a make program (For more information, see {\ul\cf11 BUILD_MAKE_PROGRAM}{\v BUILD_MAKE_PROGRAM}) to build the component.  There are files (makefil0 and {\uldb\cf11 makefile.inc}{\v mk_inc} ) that build will recognize in special circumstances (for instance, only on a clean build or only when NTTARGETFILES is specified in the sources file).

Their syntax and meaning are as follows: \par \trowd \trgaph108\trleft-108 \cellx2610\cellx7424 \pard \sa240\widctlpar\intbl {\f5 SYNCHRONIZE_DRAIN=1\cell Do not build this subdirectory until all the prior subdirectories are done.\cell }\pard \widctlpar\intbl {\f5 \row }\trowd \trgaph108\trleft-108  \cellx2610\cellx7424 \pard \sa240\widctlpar\intbl {\f5 SYNCHRONIZE_BLOCK=1\cell Do not continue building until this subdirectory is done.\cell }\pard \widctlpar\intbl {\f5 \row }\pard \ri130\sa240\widctlpar  Use SYNCHRONIZE_DRAIN when you have a subdirectory that needs the results from a prior subdirectory on the {\ul same} pa ss. For example, when building a DLL, you may have several subdirectories with TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY where each builds some component. You have another subdirectory with TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK, and the Build Utility will build a DLL that exports functions from t he component libraries. In such a case, set LINKLIBS to the component libraries, make sure the DLL subdirectory is the last in the parent DIRS file, and add SYNCHRONIZE_DRAIN=1 to the sources file for the DLL. \par Use SYNCHRONIZE_BLOCK when you have a subdirect ory that other subdirectories require the results from in order to build. The usual example is a global precompiled header. List the precompiled directory first in the DIRS list, add SYNCHRONIZE_BLOCK=1 to that sources file, and the subsequent directories  that use the PCH will not be built until the PCH is created. \par {\b Note}: Use these directives very sparingly because they completely stall an MP build when they're encountered. In most cases, the problem is not with the MP nature of the build, but rather the mac ros used in the sources file. A common mistake is using LINKLIBS to specify import libraries when building a DLL. You almost never want to do this. LINKLIBS {\ul mus} t exist during pass 1 because they're used to build the import library for the DLL. TARGETLIBS do not need to exist until pass 2 because they are only used to link the image. Use LINKLIBS for component libraries only. Use TARGETLIBS for import libraries. \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} Specifying_Libraries}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar  \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super $} Specifying Libraries}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} Specifying Libraries}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} LIBR:0 }} Specifying Libraries \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\f5 Unlike some other environments that use }the LIB environment variable, the Build Utility always requires the full path to eliminate any ambiguity.  \par For instance, s{\f5 ome build processes rely on the linker to "}{\i\f5 figure out"}{\f5   the correct libraries by using paths stored in the LIB environment variable and a list of default libraries stored in the objects.  However, there's an inherent (and undesirable) side-effect in this approach because you never really know what library you 're using, and controlling this on a per-library basis is difficult. For consistency, the Built Utility requ ires you specify the full path to the library(s) and it will disable any default library lookup the linker might perform.  Additionally, when specifying the libraries, you should try to abstract any absolute dependencies in the path. The build process pro vides an asterisk to take the place of the platform.  You can use }{\ul\cf11 BASEDIR}{\v BASEDIR} {\f5 macro to take the place for the root of the source tree.

Specify those header files in {\uldb\cf11 USER_INCLUDES}{\v USER_INCLUDES}.  \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} LANGUAGE}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} LANGUAGE}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} LANGUAGE;Macros}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} MACROS:0}} LANGUAGE \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar\tx2718\tx8856 \f7\fs20  Use this macro to specify the language when you set up dependencies so that you can include country-specific parts in your build. If you are building a product for the USA, you may want to include a USA icon, but if you are building for Korea, you would w ant to use a Korean one. \line \line For example, the Exchange team used this macro because their directory tree was set up so that \\LANG\\LANGUAGE\\USA\\mainscree n.bmp was used for their main splash screen. So they could just override LANGUAGE to build their product for Korea, Japan or any other country. They set LANGUAGE to something that was unique for them: KOR for Korean, JPN for Japan and GER for German. But  there is no limitation on what this can be so long as it makes sense in your build environment.\line \line The default is LANGUAGE=USA.  \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} LINKER_FLAGS}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} LINKER_FLAGS}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} LINKER_FLAGS;Macros}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} MACROS:0}} LINKER_FLAGS \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 Use the LINKER_FLAGS macro to override any default linker switch that you want to pass to the linker.

The Build Utility turns some switches on, by default. One of them is the OPTICAL_AND_REF switch, which says, "Throw out everything that's not referenced in this module." This is the right thing to do if y ou want small modules, but if you've got some debug routines in there that you want to call from the  debugger, it's kind of annoying to have them all thrown away on you. To avoid this, set LINKER_NOREF in your environment, rebuild your product, load it up in the debugger, and then run these functions that are only used in the debug scenario. \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} LINKLIBS}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} LINKLIBS}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} LINKLIBS;Macros;PERFLIBS;TARGETLIBS}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} MACROS:0}}  LINKLIBS \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 Use the LINKLIBS macro to specify libraries that you need to link against. LINKLIBS enables you to specify a macro called PERFLIBS, which are extra libraries you use for a performance case. \par Example:  The Windows\~NT Performance Lab people do that when they build the system to generate the BBT ordering files. They set PERFLIBS equal to some extra libraries that they want linked in to get some instrumentation stuff. \par The only difference between TARGETLIBS and LINKLIBS is the ordering on the command line. LINKLIBS usually gets passed first; TARGETLIBS gets passed second. If you order them in your TARGETLIBS macro correctly, that shouldn't be a problem EXCEPT when you a re building a DLL. When you are building a DLL, you may have some objects that you've buil t, but you also have some other libraries that you want to export some features from. Maybe you go to subdirectory one and compile a number of objects into a library. In subdirectory two, you compile some more into a library. In subdirectory three, you ac tually build the DLL, but it exports functions that are defined in library one or library two. So put those libraries in your LINKLIBS macro.  \par {\pntext\tab}\pard\plain \s17\sb50\widctlpar\noline\pvpara\phpg\posy0\absw540\dxfrtext180\dfrmtxtx180\dfrmtxty0{\*\pn

You must structure your build in such a manner that the libraries will be guaranteed to exist during pass o ne. You should never specify an import library in your LINKLIBS macro, mainly because you can get into some real nasty cases where you export something that you've imported from somebody else instead of what you actually had, perhaps with typos or whateve  You may not realize this until suddenly your program starts acting really weird. Stick with the rule that you use TARGETLIBS everywhere. There is TARGETLIBS and There is LINKLIBS; if you use TARGETLIBS for everything, life is good.

When they release a built from the Windows\~ NT  Build Lab, they increase the master version number. Anything they link or build after that will automatically get a new version resource attached to it with the correct build number. \par You can go into the File Manager or Windows Explorer or you can run filever.exe to view properties and see which version resource setup uses when it copies that image onto a new system. The system checks whether or not the version resource is newer than t he one already on the system. If it is, it is copied onto the system, otherwise it is not.  \par There is a master version file for Windows\~NT, from which all version resources are built. The Master Version File for Windows\~NT is called ntverp and it's located in \\\\public\\sdk\\ inc. You can either use ntverp or use the MASTER_VERSION_FILE macro to specify a different master version file. You do not have to have \\\\public\\sdk\\inc\\ ntverp.h. The VC team uses a different master version file because they have a different version scheme than the Windows\~NT group does.  \par If you look on the very last line of {\uldb\cf11 makefile.def}{\v makefile_def} , you will see the one place where MASTER_VERSION_FILE is used as a dependency for the resources.

Most people in the Windows\~ NT group use /Odi, which is unoptimize everything, for the code they want to hand debug. All of these flags also have platform-specific variants. If you know your code works great on all platforms except PowerPC, you can set the  MSC_WARNING_LEVEL to /W3/WX and then you can say PPC_WARNING_LEVEL=/W1. The same is true for optimization, you can specify PPC optimization or MIPS optimization or Alpha optimization or i386 optimization to override for each specific platform. If you do n ot specify any of those, MSC optimization will be the default. If you do not specify MSC_OPTIMIZATION, the default is: \par \pard \li720\ri130\sa240\widctlpar Oxs - Fully optimize, size overrules speed.  \par \pard \ri130\sa240\widctlpar {\f5 While performance testing Windows\~ NT, it was determined that the overhead from handling page faults and cache misses usually outweighs any optimization the compiler might make that results in larger code. Therefore /Oxs is used by default. It directs the  compiler, "when presented with an optimization choice that is either bigger/faster or smaller/s lower, choose the smaller case". This is also the reason why /G5 isn't used when compiling for X86. /G5 directs  the compiler to break complex instructions into several more primitive instructions that the Pentium can run faster. Again, larger code typica lly means more page faults and the net result is slower performance. \par If, after testing for yourself, you find that this is not the case for your code, you can always override the generic MSC_OPTIMIZATION macro with platform-specific macros.

Instead, the Build Utility directs binplace.exe to strip the symbols from all the images and put them in a symbols subdirectory. Then the Windows\~ NT group ships the binary subdirectory.

Whenever yo u change one of the source files, you need to rebuild that file. The Build Utility will detect that you used precompiled headers there, and will compile that single source file without them. That enables you to build everything, then change a definition i n a header file (for example, a #define {\i something} to {\i something else} ). Then you change the source file to use that new definition. You really do not want to regenerate the precompiled header and rebuild everything else. You just want to rebuild that one sour ce file. But you do not want to use the old precompiled header because that information is not valid any more. So in that case, the Build Utility does a non-precompiled header build. For that one source file, it turns off precompiled headers. That makes i t reread all the headers, and all the type information is then correct.

They are  usually quite large, in the neighborhood of a meg or more, with several hundred thousand lines.

It should be your primary method for specifying libraries or objects you want to link against to build your image.  \par You can also use the {\uldb\cf11 LINKLIBS}{\v LINKLIBS} macro to specify libraries that you need to link against. The only difference is the ordering on the command line. LINKLIBS usually gets passed first; TARGETLIBS  gets passed second. If you order them in your TARGETLIBS macro correctly, that shouldn't be a problem EXCEPT when you are building a DLL. When you are building a DLL, you may have some objects that you've built, but you also have some other libraries tha t you want to export some features from. Maybe you go to subdirectory one and compile a number of objects into a library. In subdirectory two, you compile some more into a library. In subdirectory three, you actually build the DLL, but it exports function s that are defined in library one or library two. So put those libraries in your LINKLIBS macro.  \par {\pntext\tab}\pard\plain \s17\sb50\widctlpar\noline\pvpara\phpg\posy0\absw540\dxfrtext180\dfrmtxtx180\dfrmtxty0{\*\pn

to be around in pass one of the build, because the Build Utility builds the import libraries during pass one. You must structure your build in such a manner that the libraries will be guaranteed to exist d uring pass one. You should never specify an import library  in your LINKLIBS macro, mainly because you can get into some real nasty cases where you export something that you've imported from somebody else instead of what you actually had, perhaps with typos or whatever. You may not realize this until suddenly your  program starts acting really weird. Stick with the rule that you use TARGETLIBS everywhere. There is TARGETLIBS and There is LINKLIBS; if you use TARGETLIBS for everything, life is good. (To avoid problems when doing multi-processor builds, see { \uldb\cf11 Multi-processor Build Issues}{\v Multi_processor_Build_Issues}.)  \par Use LINKLIBS {\ul only} for the case that meets the following conditions: \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}\pard \fi-360\li360\ri130\sa240\widctlpar\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnhang{\pntxtb \'b7}}You are building a dynamic link. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}You are exporting something that's defined in some other component library that you also build. \par {\pntext\pard\plain\f1\fs20 \'b7\tab}In your dirs file in the subdirectory above, you have ordered it so that the component libraries are around before you build the dynamic link.  \par \pard \ri130\sa240\widctlpar There is a similar macro called {\uldb\cf11 UMLIBS}{\v UMLIBS} that you can use if you are building UMAPPLs. \par \pard\plain \s1\li115\ri130\sb80\sa120\widctlpar \b\f7\kerning28 \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super #} TARGETNAME}} {\cs16\super ${\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 { \cs16\super $} TARGETNAME}} {\cs16\super K{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super K} TARGETNAME;Macros}} {\cs16\super +{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\ri130\sa240\widctlpar \f7\fs20 {\cs16\super +} MACROS:0}} TARGETNAME \par \pard\plain \ri130\sa240\widctlpar\tx4428\tx8856 \f7\fs20 Use this macro to specify the name of the library being built, excluding the filename extension.

For example, a Windows\~ NT developer built kernel32.dll and also kernel32.lib that users of kernel32.dll would link against. In the past, you would handle all that by specifying: \par \pard \li720\ri130\sa240\widctlpar TARGETPATH=publicsdk.lib \par \pard \ri130\sa240\widctlpar and it would put both the DLL and the import library in the public tree. By specifying TARGETPATHLIB, you can say, \ldblquote Put the library in the public tree.\rdblquote   Then you can set TARGETPATH=obj and we use the DLL in the obj subdirectory in the source tree and put the import library in the public tree where people might want to share it.  \par The VC team uses this because on their release point they have the root of the VC tree and then they have a bin subdirectory and a lib subdirectory.

It's a program library.  \par PROGRAM - This is just a plain, program file that does not export anything. It just imports stuff in the default .exe on the command line.  \par DYNLINK - A DLL, a control panel applet, anything that can be dynamically loaded or that people can import from that has to have when its linked, it uses the DLL switch to the linker to indicate it's not a standalone .exe. It's actually something that's d ynamically linked. When you build a dynamic link, you may also need to set the {\ul\cf11 TARGETEXT}{\v TARGETEXT} macro. \par LIBRARY  - A component library. This is a library of objects, not an import library (an import library is built as a side effect of building a dynamic link. Anytime you build a dynamic link, you get a .lib file and a .dll file. When you build a library, you just g et a .lib file.) \par DRIVER - A system kernel driver. \par EXPORT_DRIVER - An export driver is like a driver except it exports things. It provides services to other drivers. There are two of those in Windows\~NT. \par HAL - {\ul\cf11 Hardware Abstraction Layer. }{\v Hardware_Abstraction_Layer} This is the kernel HAL for Windows\~NT.  \par BOOTPGM - A kernel driver. \par MINIPORT - A kernel driver. \par GDI_DRIVER - A kernel driver that is similar to a DLL, which is loaded in user and kernel space.

Generate a full build of the project with your existing build.  Make sure you can find all the switches passed to the compiler, include paths, linker options, resource compiler usage, ext ra utilities you use, directory processing order, etc.  Most builds try to hide all of this, but it's important for this purpose.   \par 2. Take a look at the extra tools you use.  If they aren't available for all platforms (X86, Mips, Alpha, PPC, etc.), find the source code and start building it first.  If you can't get the tools for all platforms, don't waste your time converting more co \par 3. Look over the output from Step1.  Many non-trivial builds will have common code.  Build library(s) with this code.  If you want to do dual builds while you're converting, your existing makefiles can have a wrapper added.

Otherwise, your existing build will still work. \par 4. Build the core DLLs next.  This will also generate import libraries.  \par 5. Build the .exes and ancillary DLLs next.  These will probably use the common libraries you built in Step 3 and the import libraries from Step 4. \par 6. Add dirs files as needed to these together.  By using DIRS for projects you're sure build and OPTIONAL_DIRS to projects that you're converting, you can keep the build working for other users at the same time.  Try to list the directories that build lib raries and DLL's first as it reduces the chance you'll need Multiprocessor synchronization. \par 7. Make sure you have someone else build on an alternate platform just to make sure you didn't introduce a platform dependency.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6D:\win32app\wordnt\TEMPLATE\normal.dot Control ACLs User Interface Definition Command line utility to Control ACLs davemont davemont Microsoft Word 6.0Control ACLs Introduction Control ACLS (CACLS) is an NT command line program that displays and modifies Access Control Lists (ACLs) on NTFS volumes.   The ACL on a file controls who has access to the file.  CACLS is partially modeled after LANMANs NET ACCESS, with enhancements to support NT s more powerful security system.   EXAMPLES (display): d:> cacls file1.dat(the filename can include wildcards) file1.dat \Everyone:F (this means that  everyone  has all access to this file) d:> cacls \tmp\*.* /tree(without the *.*  we would only get the ACL for directory \tmp) \tmp\file2.dat Everyone:F \tmp\file3.dat Everyone:F \tmp\deepdir Everyone:(OI)(CI)R               bandon\homer:(OI)(CI)F \tmp\deepdir\file4.dat Everyone:R EXAMPLES (modify): d:> cacls file1.dat /edit /grant bandon\homer:F /deny abingdon\peter (using cacls to display the results of the command) d:>cacls file1.dat file1.dat abingdon\peter:N            Everyone:F           bandon\homer:F d:> cacls file1.dat /grant \Everyone:R(without the /edit option this command replaces the ACL) (using cacls to display the results of the command) d:>cacls file1.dat file1.dat \Everyone:R Cacls command syntax Purpose The cacls (Control ACLs) command displays or modifies object access permission control on file systems with user-level security.  This command works both locally and remotely. Syntax cacls object [/edit] [/replace name:permission[...]]  [/grant name:permission[...]] [/revoke name[..]] [/deny name[...]]] [/tree] [/continue] where: /Edit Edits (modifies) the existing access control permissions on an object.  If the edit qualifier is not present all permissions on the object are removed, and the name:permissions specified in the command are applied. /rePlace Replaces (or adds) the specified access control permission(s) on an object for the specified user(s) or group(s) following the /replace option, prior to the next / option. /Grant Ensures that the user has at least the specified access control permissions on an object for each user or group & permission pair.  If the user or group already has a higher level of access control permission, the access control permission will not be changed. /Revoke Removes access control permissions from an object for a user(s) or group(s).  The user(s) or group(s) will have no access to the object. /Deny replaces (or adds) an explicit deny access control permission on an object for the specified user(s) or group(s).  This is the same as /replace name:N. /Tree Executes the command on all objects in all subdirectories.  This command will only have an affect if object is a directory. /Continue Continue on access denied error.  If the user (of the command) is denied access to a sub-directory, the sub-directory is skipped and processing continues on the next object. object is a disk, directory, or file for which accesses permissions are to be viewed or assigned. a user name or system\user name combination. name:permission applies one or more permissions(RCAN) for an existing username or groupname to  object.  Do not use a delimiter when typing permissions.  Separate multiple name:permission entries with spaces.  A description of each permission follows.  The permission defines what a user or group can do with an object (for example R allows a user to read a file). If a user has C (Change) permission to an object, the user can change the object. permission (R) Read Allows a user to read the object(s). (C) Change Allows a user to change (write to) the object(s). (F) Full control Allows a user to read, write, execute and delete an object(s). (N) No Access The user will not be able to read, write, delete or modify an object(s) in any way.  If the user has read permission to the objects container (directory), the user will be able to see that an object(s) exists (name, size, modify time). EXAMPLES: cacls *.* /EDIT /G dave:C ensures the user DAVE has Change access control permission to all the files in the current directory. cacls *.* /EDIT /P rob:R /T replaces all access control entries for user ROB with  READ access control entries for user ROB to all files and directories below the current directory, including the files in the current directory. cacls d:\test /EDIT /R bill removes all access control entries for user BILL from directory (or file) d:\test cacls d:\test.c /P everyone:F /T replaces all access control entries for all users with full access control entries for user EVERYONE to all files and directories below d:\ called test.c (ie. you need *.* to cover all files and directories). ALGORITHMS: Permissions are added in the order they are on the command line, which is then the order the security system processes them.  Deny permissions are applied at the front of the ACL, before existing permissions and override allowed permissions.  Allowed permissions are added at the end of the ACL. Without the /edit option the user:permissions from the command line will replace any existing permissions on the file(s). /edit /revoke name All permissions for name are removed,  and name will not be able to access the object(s), unless name is part of another group that does have permissions to access the object(s). example:  cacls  /edit /revoke Issac BEFORE: AFTER: Anne:NONE Anne:NONE admin:FULL CONTROL admin:FULL CONTROL finance:READ finance:READ Issac:READ Roger:CHANGE Roger:CHANGE /edit /grant name:permission Name is giving the specified permissions to the object.  If Name already has a greater permission Names permission is not changed. example:  cacls /edit /grant Roger:READ BEFORE: AFTER: Anne:NONE Anne:NONE admin: FULL CONTROL admin: FULL CONTROL finance:READ finance:READ Issac:READ Issac:READ Roger:CHANGE Roger:CHANGE (note that Roger retains his CHANGE access permission) /replace name:permission all occurrences of permissions for name are removed, and the specified permission is added to the object(s). example:  cacls /edit /replace Roger:READ BEFORE: AFTER: Anne:NONE Anne:NONE admin: FULL CONTROL admin: FULL CONTROL finance:READ finance:READ Issac:READ Issac:READ Roger:CHANGE Roger:READ Iteration through files completes when the last file is found, or an error other then ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES or ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND is encountered. Without the /tree option: all objects are processed e.g., if object is: c:\tmp where tmp is a directory, only c:\tmp is processed c:\*.dat then all matching objects are processed. c:\tmp\*.* all objects in tmp are processed With the /tree option If object is a directory and contains no wildcards, then object and all objects below object are processed.  e.g., if object is: c:\tmp where tmp is a directory, then c:\tmp is processed, and c:\tmp\*.* down is processed c:\tmp\*.* then c:\tmp\*.* down is processed. If object is not a directory and/or contains wildcards, then all matching objects, and all matching objects below are processed.  e.g., if object is: c:\tmp.* then all objects that match c:\tmp.* are processed, and if any c:\tmp.* s are directories, any of there contents that match tmp.* are processed, continuing on down. CACLS loop thru name:permissions, get sids & create new aces, compute size loop thru files if old aces exist    loop thru new aces       if new ace option is GRANT          loop thru old aces             if new ace SID equals old ace SID                do inheritance check                found = true                if old ace type is ALLOWED                   or new ace mask into old ace mask                else                   and not new ace mask into old ace mask          endloop          if not found             add size of new ace          else             new ace mask = 0       else          add size of new ace   endloop   loop thru old aces       loop thru new aces          if new ace option is one of DENY, REPLACE, REVOKE             if new ace SID equals old ace SID                found = true                break       endloop       if not found          add size of old ace       else          old ace mask = 0    endloop    for new aces       add size of new ace     create new security descriptor (reference old owner, group, sacl) loop thru new aces    if new ace option equals DENY       add new ace if old aces    loop thru old aces       if old ace mask != 0          add old ace    loop thru new aces       if new ace option is not DENY          if new ace mask is not equal to 0             add new ace    loop thru new aces       if new ace option is not DENY          add new ace set security on file endloop ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RESULTING ACL: ACL header new access denied ACEs old access denied ACEs old access allowed ACEs new access allowed ACEs inheritance These Inheritance rules only apply to directories. CACLS adds permissions to a directory such that the permissons a file created in the directory, a sub-directory created in the directory, and on the directory itself.  (ie. CACLS adds an ACE with OBJECT_INHERIT and CONTAINER_INHERIT flags set.) When CACLS is granting permissions on a directory, as long as an ACE is found to apply permissions on the directory, on file created within the directory, and on directories created within the directory, CACLS will grant the permissions.  Otherwise CACLS will return an error, and the replace option must be used.

The CACLS tool displays or modifies the ACLs of files. 

Usage:

CACLS filename [/T] [/E] [/C] [/G user:perm] [/R user] [/P user:perm]
               [/D user]

filename       Displays ACLs.
/T             Changes ACLs of specified files in the current 
               directory and all subdirectories.
/E             Edit ACL instead of replacing it.
/C             Continue on access denied errors.

/G user:perm   Grant specified user access rights.
               Perm can be: R  Read
                            C  Change (write)
                            F  Full control
/R user        Revoke specified user's access rights.
/P user:perm   Replace specified user's access rights.
               Perm can be: N  None
                            R  Read
                            C  Change (write)
                            F  Full control
/D user        Deny specified user access.

Wildcards can be used to specify more that one file in a command. You can 
specify more than one user in a command.

Overview
                                   
Device driver, service and application developers that wish to provide 
performance measuring capability in their software must have a way to 
incorporate the names of the performance counters and counter objects 
into the registry. Currently the only methods available are the manual 
installation of the names into the registry or for each developer to 
devise a scheme to do it programmatically. Since the "correct" way to 
do this is poorly documented and difficult to explain, the following 
utilities and library functions are provided to make the installation
and removal of these extensible counters much simpler and less prone 
to error and confusion.

The two command line utilities provided with Windows NT are shown below.

    > LodCtr MyDriver.INI

    > UnLodCtr MyDriver


LoadPerf.DLL is provided to the software developer to provide access 
to these same functions (in both Unicode & ANSI formats) from within 
a setup program.

    LoadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine
        BOOL    bQuietModeFlag)

    UnloadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine,
        BOOL    bQuietMode)

The contents of the string arguments in the above functions are the
same as those for the command line.
 

The installation utility (LodCtr) accepts as an argument the name of 
the device or application's counter .INI file. The format of the .INI 
file is described in detail later in this document. This utility will 
enter the counter names and explain text stored in the .INI file into 
the corresponding data file and update the necessary keys and values 
for the extensible performance counter DLL.

The removal utility UnLodCtr accepts as an argument, the name of the 
regsistry key which is to have its names removed from the data files.
This key is the registry key that the application, service or device 
driver us using under the ...\Services key and has the Performance
subkey.
 
The extensible performance counter DLL must be written to look up 
the base values of the counter names and explain text during 
initialization for this to function properly.

.INI file format

The .ini file for the extensible performance counter will consist 
of keys and values in a format similar to that of a MS-Windows 
.INI file (e.g. WIN.INI) This will allow a format that is somewhat 
self-documenting as well as allow current Win32 utilities to process 
it and parse the data (e.g. GetPrivateProfileString). A single file 
was selected to minimize the development and maintenance overhead of 
adding or modifying counters and adding foreign language support. 
The contents of the .INI file are described below:


Usage Notes:

The following assumptions are made in the use of counter names and
explain text and should be followed in order to insure predictable and
reliable operation.

    - Index number ranges must not be overlapping between drivers

        The range of index numbers used by an extensible counter 
        must fall between the first and last values (see below).
        (gaps are allowed within the range used). If LodCtr is used
        then this won't be a problem.

    - Names must be assigned to EVEN numbers and Explain text assigned
        to ODD numbers.

        If the convention is followed as shown in the examples below,
        where each item is given an offset of an even number starting 
        from 0, then LodCtr will do the right thing and make this 
        assignment automatically. For this to work, however, the offest 
        values MUST ALWAYS BE EVEN NUMBERS.

    - Manual assignment of counter index values is not recommended.
        
        Failure to follow all the assumptions or manually modifying
        or "hard-coding" index values may result in counter name 
        text corruption or erroneous display of names.

    - Symbol file format must conform to the following:
        
        #define NAME    decimal_number

        The symbol file processor is pretty dumb and can read .H header
        files but will only understand lines that conform to the above
        format. (in line comments after the number are OK) see the
        example below for more information.


// Begin .INI file format

[info]
drivername=<name of device found under the CurrentControlSet\Services key>
symbolfile=<.h file containing symbolic offsets of counters>

[languages] // one key (value optional) for each language supported in file
009=
 .
 .
 .
 .


[text]  // counter & explain text for customer-defined counters
offset_langid_NAME=text
offset_langid_HELP=text

// offset must be a symbolic constant (from symbolfile)
// offset value must be an even number (see code example for why)
// NAME and HELP are literal text and identify counter names or 
// explain text
// langid must be listed as a key under [languages]
// text must be entered on a single line (though it can be a long one)

// end .INI file format


The .ini file must be loaded into the registry before the extensible
performance counter DLL is initialized (e.g. during or immediately 
after the driver is loaded for the first time. Once the counter names 
are loaded, however, they will remain until they are removed or NT is 
reinstalled.


Following is an example of how the various components of an extensible 
counter would incorporate the definitions of the .INI file and the use
of the LodCtr and UnLodCtr utilities.  This example has one object and
two counters.

// begin devdef.H file

// legal constant definitions

#define OBJECT_1    0
#define DEVICE_COUNTER_1    2
#define DEVICE_COUNTER_2    4


// end devdef.H file

// BEGIN: Object & Counter structure initialization file

// defines static structures used to build the perf data that is
// returned by the extensible counter routines

#include "devdef.h"

    {   sizeof(MY_DEVICE_CTR_DEFINITION) + SIZE_OF_CTR_DATA,

        .
        .

When LodCtr has loaded the contents of the .INI file the following 
registry keys will have been updated.  The ":" indicates a Value of
a Key; other symbols are keys in the registry.

MACHINE
    SYSTEM
        CurrentControlSet
            Services
                <devicename>
                    Performance
                        :First Counter (updated to show current value)
                        :First Help    (updated to show current value)
                        :Last Counter  (updated to show current value)
                        :Last Help     (updated to show current value)
                
MACHINE
    SOFTWARE
        Microsoft
            Windows NT
                CurrentVersion
                    Perflib            
                        :Last Counter (updated to show current value)
                        :Last Help    (updated to show current value)  



After UnLodCtr is run to remove a driver's counters from the data file,
the following changes to the registry will take place

MACHINE
    SYSTEM
        CurrentControlSet
            Services
                <devicename>
                    Performance
                        :First Counter     (value deleted)
                        :First Help        (value deleted)
                        :Last Counter      (value deleted)
                        :Last Help         (value deleted)
                
MACHINE
    SOFTWARE
        Microsoft
            Windows NT
                CurrentVersion

Changes to PerfMon perfc???.ini and perfh???.ini files
------------------------------------------------------

These init files used to be under oakbin for NT1.0.  However, for NT1.0a,
these counter names and help texts are removed from the registry to save size
and improve system performance.  (save 200K bytes of paged pool per language).
The newPerfmon will look for these names in PerfC???.dat and PerfH???.dat inside 
the System32 directory.  If you have to modify any of the ini files, you have to run
a utility to convert them into a data file.  The utility, initodat.exe, is in
sdktools\cntrtext\initodat.  This tool will convert the ini file to dat file 
in the same directory.  You have to move it to the System32 directory after
the conversion.


InitoDat  filename

        Usage:-

        filename is the name of the initialization file that contains
        the counter name definitions or explain text for a specific
        language.  Initodat will create a data file using the same
        name with .dat extension in the current directory.


A copy of InitoDat.exe for x86 is included here.  Also, I have converted
all the current ini fiels to dat files, too.


Please direct any question/comment to either RezaB or a-honwah.  Thanks.

    "5",     "The Memory performance object  consists of counters that "
             "describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on the "
             "computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access "
             "memory on the computer.. Virtual memory consists of the space "
             "in physical memory and on disk. Many of the memory counters "
             "monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and "
             "data between disk and physical memory. Excessive paging, a "

             "by measuring the time that the processor spends executing the "
             "thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, and "
             "subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an Idle "
             "thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready "
             "to run.) It can be viewed as the percentage of the sample "
             "interval spent doing useful work. This counter displays the "
             "average percentage of busy time observed during the sample "
             "interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time the service "
             "was inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.",

The System performance object consists of counters that apply to more than one instance of a component processors on the computer. 
5
The Memory performance object  consists of counters that describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on the computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on the computer.. Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory and on disk. Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data between disk and physical memory. Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which interfere with all system processes.
7
% Processor Time is the percentage of time that the processor is executing a non-Idle thread. This counter was designed as a primary indicator of processor activity. It is calculated by measuring the time that the processor spends executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, and subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run.) It can be viewed as the percentage of the sample interval spent doing useful w
ork. This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.
9
% Total DPC Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs). (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than the standard interrupts.) It is the sum of Processor: % DPC Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. System: % Total DPC Time is a component of System: % Total Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the inte
rrupt count.  This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
11
File Read Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to read from the file system cache. It is measured in numbers of reads. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.  
13
File Write Operations/sec is the combined rate of the file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to write to data in the file system cache. It is measured in numbers of writes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
15
File Control Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, such as file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status. This is the inverse of System: File Data Operations/sec and is measured in numbers of operations. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
17
File Read Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are read to satisfy  file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including reads from the file system cache. It is measured in numbers of bytes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.  
19
File Write Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are written to satisfy file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including writes to the file system cache. It is measured in numbers of bytes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
21
File Control Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which  bytes are transferred for all file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, including file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status. It is measured in numbers of bytes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
23
% Total Interrupt Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spent servicing interrupts.  It is the sum of Processor: % Interrupt Time for of all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripher
al devices. 
25
Available Bytes is the amount  of  physical memory available to processes running on the computer, in bytes. It is calculated by summing space on the Zeroed, Free, and Standby memory lists. Free memory is ready for use; Zeroed memory is pages of memory filled with zeros to prevent later processes from seeing data used by a previous process. Standby memory is memory removed from a process's working set (its physical memory) on route to disk, but is still available to be recalled. This counter displays the l
ast observed value only; it is not an average.. 
27
Committed Bytes is the amount of committed virtual memory, in bytes. (Committed memory is physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging file in case it needs to be written back to disk.) This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.  
29
Page Faults/sec is overall rate at which of faulted pages are handled by the processor. It is measured in numbers of pages faulted. A page fault occurs when a process requires code or data that is not in its working set (its space in physical memory). This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without consequence. However, hard faults can cause
 significant delays. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
31
Commit Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without having to extend the paging file(s). It is measured in bytes. (Committed memory is physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging files. There can be one paging file on each logical drive.)If the paging file(s) are be expanded, this limit increases accordingly. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.  
33
Write Copies/sec is the number of page faults caused by attempts to write that have been satisfied by coping of the page from elsewhere in physical memory. This is an economical way of sharing data since pages are only copied when they are written to; otherwise, the page is shared. This counter counts the number of copies, without regard for the number of pages copied in each operation. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the 
sample interval. 
35
Transition Faults/sec is the number of page faults resolved by recovering pages that were on the modified page list, on the standby list, or being written to disk at the time of the page fault. The pages were recovered without additional disk activity. Transition faults are counted in numbers of faults, without regard for the number of pages faulted in each operation. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
37
Cache Faults/sec is the number of faults which occur when a page sought in 
39
Demand Zero Faults/sec is the number of page faults that require a zeroed page to satisfy the fault. Zeroed pages, pages emptied of previously stored data and filled with zeros, are a security feature of Windows NT. They prevent processes from seeing data stored by earlier processes that used the memory space. Windows NT maintains a list of zeroed pages to accelerate this process. This counter counts numbers of faults, without regard to the numbers of pages retrieved to satisfy the fault. This counter disp
lays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
41
Pages/sec is the number of pages read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. (Hard page faults occur when a process requires code or data that is not in its working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk.) This counter was designed as a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It is the sum of Memory: Pages Input/sec and Memory: Pages Output/sec. It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such
 as Memory: Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
43
Page Reads/sec is the number of times the disk was read to resolve hard page faults. (Hard page faults occur when a process requires code or data that is not in its working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk.) This counter was designed as a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It includes reads to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached mapped memory files. This counter counts numbers 
of read operations, without regard to the numbers of pages retrieved by each operation. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
45
Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue. There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Unlike the disk counters, this counter counts ready threads only, not threads that are running..  A sustained processor queue of  greater than two threads generally indicates processor congestion.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
47
Thread State is the current state of the thread.  It is 0 for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown.  A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one.  A Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor because none are free.  A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk.  A Waiting thread h
as no use for the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.
49
Pages Output/sec is the number of pages written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written back to disk only if they are changed in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code. A high rate of pages output might indicate a memory shortage.  Windows NT writes more pages back to disk to free up space when physical memory is in short supply. This counter counts numbers of pages, and can be compared to other counts of pages, without conversion. This counter displays the differ
ence between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
51
Page Writes/sec is the number of times pages were written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written to disk only if they are changed while in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code. This counter counts write operations, without regard to the number of pages written in each operation. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
53
The Browser performance object consists of counters that measure the rates of announcements, enumerations, and other Browser transmissions.
55
Announcements Server/sec is the rate at which the servers in this domain have announced themselves to this server.
57
Pool Paged Bytes is the number of bytes in the paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. Memory: Pool Paged Bytes is calculated differently than Process: Pool Paged Bytes, so it might not equal Process: Pool Paged Bytes: _Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
59
Pool Nonpaged Bytes is the number of bytes in the nonpaged pool, an area of  system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated. Memory: Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than Process: Pool Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process: Pool Nonpaged Bytes: _Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
61
Pool Paged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the paged pool.  The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.  .
63
Pool Paged Resident Bytes is the current size of paged pool in bytes. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. Space used by the paged and nonpaged pools are taken from physical memory, so a pool that is too large denies memory space to processes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
65
Pool Nonpaged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the nonpaged pool.  The nonpaged pool is an area of system memory area for objects that cannot be written to disk, and must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
67
Bytes Total/sec is the sum of Frame Bytes/sec and Datagram Bytes/sec.  This is the total rate of bytes sent to or received from the network by the protocol, but only counts the bytes in frames (i.e., packets) which carry data.
69
System Code Total Bytes is the number of bytes of pageable operating system code currently in virtual memory. It is a measure of the amount of physical memory being used by the operating system that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is calculated by summing the bytes in Ntoskrnl.exe, Hal.dll, the boot drivers, and file systems loaded by Ntldr/osloader. This counter does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observ
ed value only; it is not an average. 
71
System Code Resident Bytes is the number of bytes of operating system code currently in physical memory that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is a component of System Code Total Bytes, which also includes operating system code on disk. System Code Resident Bytes (and System Code Total Bytes) does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.  
73
System Driver Total Bytes is the number of bytes of pageable virtual memory currently being used by device drivers. (Pageable memory can be written to disk when it is not being used.) It includes physical memory (Memory: System Driver Resident Bytes) and code and data paged to disk. It is a component of Memory: System Code Total Bytes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
75
System Driver Resident Bytes is the number of bytes of pageable physical memory being used by device drivers. It is the working set (physical memory area) of the drivers. This value is a component of Memory: System Driver Total Bytes, which also includes driver memory that has been written to disk. Neither System Driver Resident Bytes nor System Driver Total Bytes includes memory that cannot be written to disk.

The Cache performance object  consists of counters that monitor the file system cache, an area of physical memory that stores recently used data as long as possible to permit access to the data without having to read from the disk. Because applications typically use the cache, the cache is monitored as an indicator of application I/O operations. When memory is plentiful, the cache can grow, but when memory is scarce, the cache can become too small to be effective.

While pinned, a page's physical address will not be altered.
105
Pin Read Hits is the percentage of pin read requests that hit the file system cache, i.e., did not require a disk read in order to provide access to the page in the file system cache.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving data from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is usually the method used by the disk file systems as well.

A copy read is a file read operation that is satisfied by a memory copy from a page in the cache to the application's buffer.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
115
MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page involved in the transfer, and thus can employ a hardware Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to effect the copy.  The LAN Server uses this method for large transfers out of the server.
117
Sync MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.  If the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the caller will wait for the pages to fault in from the disk.
119
Async MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.

125
Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.

% User Time is the percentage of non-idle processor time spent in user mode. (User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.) This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample tim
e. 
145
Privileged Time is the percentage of non-idle processor time spent in privileged mode. (Privileged mode is a processing mode designed for operating system components and hardware-manipulating drivers. It allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems. The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.) % Privileged Ti
me includes time servicing interrupts and DPCs. A high rate of privileged time might be attributable to a large number of interrupts generated by a failing device. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time. 
147
Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another. Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service. It is the sum of Thread: Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches. There are 
context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
149
Interrupts/sec is the average number of hardware interrupts the processor is receiving and servicing in each second. It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread exe
cution is suspended during interrupts. Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
151
Systems Calls/sec is the combined rate of calls to Windows NT system service routines by all processes running on the computer. These routines perform all of the basic scheduling and synchronization of activities on the computer, and provide access to non-graphic devices, memory management, and name space management. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
153
Level 1 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
155
Level 2 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), nor is the page containing the PTE.

157
User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this process's threads have spent executing code in user mode.  Applications, environment subsystems and integral subsystems execute in user mode..  Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes pro
vide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
159
Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the threads of the process have spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows NT system service is called, the service will often run in Privileged Mode to gain access to system-private data.  Such data is protected from access by threads executing in User Mode.  Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection
 in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.

173
Virtual Bytes Peak is the maximum number of bytes of virtual address space the process has used at any one time.  Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages.  Virtual space is however finite, and by using too much, the process might limit its ability to load libraries.
175
Virtual Bytes is the current size in bytes of the virtual address space the process is using.  Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages.  Virtual space is finite, and by using too much, the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
177
Page Faults/sec is the rate of Page Faults by the threads executing in this process.  A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory.  This will not cause the page to be fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.
179
Working Set Peak is the maximum number of bytes in the Working Set of this process at any point in time.  The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process.  If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets.  If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before they leave main memo
ry.
181
Working Set is the current number of bytes in the Working Set of this process.  The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process.  If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets.  If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before they leave main memory.
183
Page File Bytes Peak is the maximum number of bytes this process has used in the paging file(s).  Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files.  Paging files are shared by all processes, and lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.
185
Page File Bytes is the current number of bytes this process has used in the paging file(s).  Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files.  Paging files are shared by all processes, and lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.
187
Private Bytes is the current number of bytes this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.
189
Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of the threads of this process used the processor to execute instructions.  An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run.  Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count..
191
Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread used the processor to execute instructions.  An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a processor, and a thread is the object that executes instructions.  Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
193
User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in user mode.  Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.  Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additio
nal protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
195
Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows NT system service is called, the service will often run in privileged mode in order to gain access to system-private data.  Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode.  Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit such as page faults and interrupts.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in add
ition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
197
Context Switches/sec is the rate of switches from one thread to another.  Thread switches can occur either inside of a single process or across processes.  A thread switch  can be caused either by one thread asking another for information, or by a thread being preempted by another, higher priority thread becoming ready to run.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsy
stem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of an application  appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the application.  Switching to the subsystem process causes one Context Switch in the application thread.  Switching back causes another Context Switch in the subsystem thread.
199
Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected.  It includes requests in service at the time of the snapshot.  This is an instantaneous length, not an average over the time interval.  Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service.  This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is l
ikely that this will be consistently high.  Requests are experiencing delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks.  This difference should average less than 2 for good performance.
201

233
The Thread performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of thread behavior. A thread is the basic object that executes instructions on a processor. All running processes have at least one thread.
235
The Physical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk drive on a computer. Disks are used to store file, program, and paging data and are read to retrieve these items, and written to record changes to them. The values of physical disk counters are sums of the values of the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are divided.
237
The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives. Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C.
239
The Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of processor activity The processor is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical computations, initiates operations on peripherals, and runs the threads of processes. A computer can have multiple processors. The processor object represents each processor as an instance of the object.
241
% Total Processor Time is the average percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing non-idle threads. This counter was designed as the primary indicator of processor activity on multiprocessor computers. It is equal to the sum of Process: % Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number of processors. It is calculated by summing the time that all processors spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing
 the difference by the number of processors on the computer. (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run.) For example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the processors are busy for all of the sample interval. This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was ina
ctive, and then subtracting that value from 100%. 
243
% Total User Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spent in User mode. It is the sum of Processor: % User Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%. (User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system
 components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.) This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time. 
245
% Total Privileged Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spent in privileged (kernel) mode. It is the sum of Processor: % Privileged Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.

(Privileged mode is an processing mode designed for operating system components which allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system sw
itches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services. The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications and environment subsystems.) This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time. 
247
Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts. It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface card
s and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts. Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
249
Processes is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data collection.  Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Each process represents the running of a program.
251

255
Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer at the time of data collection.  Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Threads use semaphores to obtain exclusive access to data structures that they share with other threads.
257
Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at the time of data collection.  This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Mutexes are used by threads to assure only one thread is executing some section of code.
259
Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the time of data collection.  Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A section is a portion of virtual memory created by a process for  a storing data.  A process can share sections with other processes.
261
The Object performance object consists of counters that monitor  logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores..  This information can be used to detect the unnecessary consumption of computer resources.  Each object requires memory to store basic information about the object.
263
The Redirector performance object consists of counter that monitor network connections originating at the local computer.
265
Bytes Received/sec is the rate of bytes coming in to the Redirector from the network.  It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers.)
267
Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter.  Some packets received might not contain incoming data, for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet.
269
Read Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read bytes in response to page faults.  Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows NT.)
271
Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when they are redirected to come from another computer.  In addition to file requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
273
Read Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file system cache by using the Redirector.  Some of these data requests are satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache. Requests that miss the Cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).
275
Read Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is not found there and must be retrieved from the network.  Dividing this value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data traveling across the network.(see Bytes Received/sec.)
277
Bytes Transmitted/sec is the rate at which bytes are leaving the Redirector to the network.  It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers and the like.)
279
Packets Transmitted/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is sending packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes transmitted in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Transmitted/sec by this counter.
281
Write Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the pages being used by applications.  The program data changed by modules (such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are 'paged out' when no longer needed.  Other output pages come from the file system cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).
283
Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are redirected to another computer.  In addition to file requests, this count includes other methods of writing across the network, such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
285
Write Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file system cache by using the Redirector.  The data might not leave your computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further modification before being written to the network.  This saves network traffic.  Each write of a byte into the cache is counted here.
287
Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are writing data across the network. This occur when the file system cache is bypassed, such as for Named Pipes or Transactions, or when the cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data.  Dividing this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of application data being to the network (see Transmitted Bytes/sec.)
289

This is the instantaneous number of available work items for this CPU.  A sustained near-zero value indicates the need to increase the MinFreeWorkItems registry value for the Server service.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.
1311
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. When a CPU runs out of work items, it borrows a free work item from another CPU.  An increasing value of this running counter might indicate the need to increase the 'MaxWorkItems' or 'MinFreeWorkItems' registry values for the Server service.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.
1313
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. A sustained value greater than zero indicates the need to increase the 'MaxWorkItems' registry value for the Server service.  This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.

DPCs Queued/sec is the overall rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the processor's DPC queue. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. Each processor has its own DPC queue.) This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
1337
DPC Rate is the rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the processor's DPC queue between the timer tics of the processor clock. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. Each processor has its own DPC queue.) This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
1343
Total DPCs Queued/sec is the combined rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the DPC queue of all processors on the computer. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts.) Each processor has its own DPC queue. This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. It is the sum of Processor: DPCs Queued/sec for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. This counter displays the d
ifference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
1345
Total DPC Rate is the combined rate at which deferred procedure calls (DPCs) are added to the DPC queues of all processors between timer tics of each processor's system clock. (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts.) Each processor has its own DPC queue. clock on the processor. This counter measures the rate at which DPCs are added to the queue, not the number of DPCs in the queue. It is the sum of Processor: DPC Rate for all processors on the computer, divided by the nu
mber of processors. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
1351

1401
Avg. Disk Queue Length is the average number of both read and write requests that were queued for the selected disk during the sample interval.
1403
Avg. Disk Read Queue Length is the average number of read requests that were queued for the selected disk during the sample interval.
1405
Avg. Disk Write Queue Length is the average number of write requests that were queued for the selected disk during the sample interval.
1407
% Committed Bytes In Use is the ratio of Memory: Committed Bytes to Memory: Commit Limit. (Committed memory is physical memory in use for which space has been reserved in the paging file should it need to be written to disk. The commit limit is determined by the size of the paging file. If the paging file is enlarged, the commit limit increases, and the ratio is reduced.) This counter displays the current percentage value only; it is not an average.
1409
The Full Image performance object consists of counters that monitor the virtual address usage of images executed by processes on the computer.  Full Image counters are the same counters as contained in Image object with the only difference being the instance name. In the Full Image object, the instance name includes the full file path name of the loaded modules, while in the Image object only the filename is displayed.
1411
The Creating Process ID value is the Process ID of the process that created the process. Note that the creating process may have terminated since this process was created and so this value may no longer identify a running process.

1481
Working Set - Shared displays the size of the working set, in bytes, that is sharable and may be used by other processes.             Because a portion of a process's working set is shareable, does not necessarily mean that other processes are using it.
1483
% Idle Time reports the percentage of time during the sample interval that the disk was idle.
1485

             "memory on the computer.  Virtual memory consists of the space "

             "thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, and "
             "subtracting that value from 100%.  (Each processor has an Idle "

Crash.exe pulls the driver it uses, crashdrv.exe, into a resource in
    it's own image. When you distribute crash.exe, you don't need the driver,
    just the EXE image. Because of this, if you change the driver you will
    have to manually copy it to crash\{architecture} for your changes to be
    reflected in crash.exe.

                              July 16, 1993.


1.  Description

        Create file tool (Creatfil.exe) is used to create a new file with 
the specified filename and file size.  If the file is already existed, it 
will be deleted and replaced with a new file.  

        If the specified file size is greater than the available space on 
the current drive,  CreatFil will create a file up to the last 1K bytes and 
report a "Write file" error.


2.  Usage
        CreatFil filename filesize
                filename -- name of the new file
                filesize -- size of the new file in KBytes.
                            default is 1024 KBytes.

DBMON notes

10/7/94


The first DWORD of the shared memory buffer contains the process ID of the
client that sent the debug string.  DBMON will print the process ID if the
previous line printed was from another process, or if the previous line was
from the same process and ended in a newline.

The shared memory buffer must be 4096 bytes.  If it is larger, it won't do any
good.  If it is smaller, nothing terrible will happen, but strings larger than
the buffer will not be delivered, and a complaining message will be sent to the
kernel debugger by the client.  Why is it this size?  Because shared memory
comes in page-sized chunks, so we might as well ask for as much as will be used
on the machines with the smallest pages.  On machines with larger pages, the
remainder of the page will be wasted anyway.

Event DBWIN_BUFFER_READY must be an auto-reset event, so that only one client
thread will use the buffer at a time.  Using a manual reset event with
PulseEvent will not work.

Event DBWIN_DATA_READY need not be auto-reset, but it is simpler that way.

Allowing multiple copies of DBMON to run might be amusing, put not particularly
useful.  As I originally wrote it, the messages were distributed randomly among
the DBMON instances or be garbled.  I added a check for ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS so
it won't run twice.  The worst you can do to the client is cause it to print a
message on the kernel debugger, as above.

If DBMON is broken and never calls SetEvent(AckEvent), it will cause a 10
second delay in the client every time OutputDebugString is called, then the
message will be printed on the kernel debugger.

OutputDebugString will force synchronization of client threads when DBMON is
running.  Letting the kernel debugger catch the strings will also synchronize
threads, but the timing effects may be different.  Caveat emptor.

In a GUI version of DBMON, use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects.

Welcome to Exception Monitor (EM) 8.0. Please refer to these notes to obtain the most recent information about new features, configuration requirements and installation instructions.

3.   Installation Instructions


-----------------
1.   NEW FEATURES
-----------------

Like earlier versions of Exception Monitor, EM 8.0 allows you to monitor and view system information to diagnose an exception or fault. Unlike earlier versions, you don't need to be an expert with debugging commands to obtain useful information. EM 8.0 puts a user-friendly shell around the debugging environment, allowing users to perform an automatic monitoring session by selecting from a standard debug script (.ecx files). 

If you are comfortable with debugging commands, you can access the CDB window by performing a manual monitoring session. The CDB window allows experienced users to interact with and control the debugger using commands.

-------------------------------
2.   CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

Operating Systems compatible with EM 8.0:

Windows 2000 or later

You also will need Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater to operate the Help file properly.

Note:   Users of earlier operating systems must use Exception Monitor 7.0 or earlier.
