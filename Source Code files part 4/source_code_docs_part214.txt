 data bytes. The size of the
      block does not account for the size byte itself, therefore, the empty
      sub-block is one whose size field contains 0x00.

            i) Signature - Identifies the GIF Data Stream. This field contains
            the fixed value 'GIF'.

            ii) Version - Version number used to format the data stream.
            Identifies the minimum set of capabilities necessary to a decoder
            to fully process the contents of the Data Stream.

            Version Numbers as of 10 July 1990 :       "87a" - May 1987
                                                       "89a" - July 1989

            Version numbers are ordered numerically increasing on the first two
            digits starting with 87 (87,88,...,99,00,...,85,86) and
            alphabetically increasing on the third character (a,...,z).

      d. Recommendations.

            i) Signature - This field identifies the beginning of the GIF Data
            Stream; it is not intended to provide a unique signature for the
            identification of the data. It is recommended that the GIF Data
            Stream be identified externally by the application. (Refer to
            Appendix G for on-line identification of the GIF Data Stream.)

            ii) Version - ENCODER : An encoder should use the earliest possible
            version number that defines all the blocks used in the Data Stream.
            When two or more Data Streams are combined, the latest of the
            individual version numbers should be used for the resulting Data
            Stream. DECODER : A decoder should attempt to process the data
            stream to the best of its ability; if it encounters a version
            number which it is not capable of processing fully, it should
            nevertheless, attempt to process the data stream to the best of its
            ability, perhaps after warning the user that the data may be
            incomplete.


18. Logical Screen Descriptor.

      a. Description.  The Logical Screen Descriptor contains the parameters
      necessary to define the area of the display device within which the
      images will be rendered.  The coordinates in this block are given with
      respect to the top-left corner of the virtual screen; they do not
      necessarily refer to absolute coordinates on the display device.  This
      implies that they could refer to window coordinates in a window-based
      environment or printer coordinates when a printer is used.

      This block is REQUIRED; exactly one Logical Screen Descriptor must be
      present per Data Stream.

      b. Required Version.  Not applicable. This block is not subject to a
      version number. This block must appear immediately after the Header.

                             Size of Global Color Table    3 Bits

            i) Logical Screen Width - Width, in pixels, of the Logical Screen
            where the images will be rendered in the displaying device.

            ii) Logical Screen Height - Height, in pixels, of the Logical
            Screen where the images will be rendered in the displaying device.

            iii) Global Color Table Flag - Flag indicating the presence of a
            Global Color Table; if the flag is set, the Global Color Table will
            immediately follow the Logical Screen Descriptor. This flag also
            selects the interpretation of the Background Color Index; if the
            flag is set, the value of the Background Color Index field should
            be used as the table index of the background color. (This field is
            the most significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   No Global Color Table follows, the Background
                              Color Index field is meaningless.
                        1 -   A Global Color Table will immediately follow, the
                              Background Color Index field is meaningful.

            iv) Color Resolution - Number of bits per primary color available
            to the original image, minus 1. This value represents the size of
            the entire palette from which the colors in the graphic were
            selected, not the number of colors actually used in the graphic.
            For example, if the value in this field is 3, then the palette of
            the original image had 4 bits per primary color available to create
            the image.  This value should be set to indicate the richness of
            the original palette, even if not every color from the whole
            palette is available on the source machine.

            v) Sort Flag - Indicates whether the Global Color Table is sorted.
            If the flag is set, the Global Color Table is sorted, in order of
            decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be decreasing
            frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists a decoder,
            with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset of colors;
            the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to render the
            graphic.

            Values :    0 -   Not ordered.
                        1 -   Ordered by decreasing importance, most
                              important color first.

            vi) Size of Global Color Table - If the Global Color Table Flag is
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the number
            of bytes contained in the Global Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to [the value of the field
            + 1].  Even if there is no Global Color Table specified, set this
            field according to the above formula so that decoders can choose
            the best graphics mode to display the stream in.  (This field is
            made up of the 3 least significant bits of the byte.)

            vii) Background Color Index - Index into the Global Color Table for







                                                                        10


            the Background Color. The Background Color is the color used for
            those pixels on the screen that are not covered by an image. If the
            Global Color Table Flag is set to (zero), this field should be zero
            and should be ignored.

            viii) Pixel Aspect Ratio - Factor used to compute an approximation
            of the aspect ratio of the pixel in the original image.  If the
            value of the field is not 0, this approximation of the aspect ratio
            is computed based on the formula:

            Aspect Ratio = (Pixel Aspect Ratio + 15) / 64

            The Pixel Aspect Ratio is defined to be the quotient of the pixel's
            width over its height.  The value range in this field allows
            specification of the widest pixel of 4:1 to the tallest pixel of
            1:4 in increments of 1/64th.

            Values :        0 -   No aspect ratio information is given.
                       1..255 -   Value used in the computation.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the entire Data
      Stream. This block cannot be modified by any extension.

      e. Recommendations. None.


19. Global Color Table.

      a. Description. This block contains a color table, which is a sequence of
      bytes representing red-green-blue color triplets. The Global Color Table
      is used by images without a Local Color Table and by Plain Text
      Extensions. Its presence is marked by the Global Color Table Flag being
      set to 1 in the Logical Screen Descriptor; if present, it immediately
      follows the Logical Screen Descriptor and contains a number of bytes
      equal to
                    3 x 2^(Size of Global Color Table+1).

      This block is OPTIONAL; at most one Global Color Table may be present
      per Data Stream.

20. Image Descriptor.

      a. Description. Each image in the Data Stream is composed of an Image
      Descriptor, an optional Local Color Table, and the image data.  Each
      image must fit within the boundaries of the Logical Screen, as defined
      in the Logical Screen Descriptor.

      The Image Descriptor contains the parameters necessary to process a table
      based image. The coordinates given in this block refer to coordinates
      within the Logical Screen, and are given in pixels. This block is a
      Graphic-Rendering Block, optionally preceded by one or more Control
      blocks such as the Graphic Control Extension, and may be optionally
      followed by a Local Color Table; the Image Descriptor is always followed
      by the image data.

      This block is REQUIRED for an image.  Exactly one Image Descriptor must
      be present per image in the Data Stream.  An unlimited number of images
      may be present per Data Stream.

           the most significant bit of the byte.)


           Values :    0 -   Local Color Table is not present. Use
                             Global Color Table if available.
                       1 -   Local Color Table present, and to follow
                             immediately after this Image Descriptor.








                                                                        13


           vii) Interlace Flag - Indicates if the image is interlaced. An image
           is interlaced in a four-pass interlace pattern; see Appendix E for
           details.

           Values :    0 - Image is not interlaced.
                       1 - Image is interlaced.

            viii) Sort Flag - Indicates whether the Local Color Table is
            sorted.  If the flag is set, the Local Color Table is sorted, in
            order of decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be
            decreasing frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists
            a decoder, with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset
            of colors; the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to
            render the graphic.

            Values :    0 -   Not ordered.
                        1 -   Ordered by decreasing importance, most
                              important color first.

            ix) Size of Local Color Table - If the Local Color Table Flag is
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the number
            of bytes contained in the Local Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to the value of the field
            + 1. This value should be 0 if there is no Local Color Table
            specified. (This field is made up of the 3 least significant bits
            of the byte.)

     d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the Table-based Image
     Data Block that follows it. This block may be modified by the Graphic
     Control Extension.

     e. Recommendation. None.


21. Local Color Table.

     a. Description. This block contains a color table, which is a sequence of
     bytes representing red-green-blue color triplets. The Local Color Table
     is used by the image that immediately follows. Its presence is marked by
     the Local Color Table Flag being set to 1 in the Image Descriptor; if
     present, the Local Color Table immediately follows the Image Descriptor
     and contains a number of bytes equal to
                          3x2^(Size of Local Color Table+1).
     If present, this color table temporarily becomes the active color table
     and the following image should be processed using it. This block is
     OPTIONAL; at most one Local Color Table may be present per Image
     Descriptor and its scope is the single image associated with the Image
     Descriptor that precedes it.

22. Table Based Image Data.

     a. Description. The image data for a table based image consists of a
     sequence of sub-blocks, of size at most 255 bytes each, containing an
     index into the active color table, for each pixel in the image.  Pixel
     indices are in order of left to right and from top to bottom.  Each index
     must be within the range of the size of the active color table, starting
     at 0. The sequence of indices is encoded using the LZW Algorithm with
     variable-length code, as described in Appendix F

            i) LZW Minimum Code Size.  This byte determines the initial number
            of bits used for LZW codes in the image data, as described in
            Appendix F.

     d. Extensions and Scope. This block has no scope, it contains raster
     data. Extensions intended to modify a Table-based image must appear
     before the corresponding Image Descriptor.

     e. Recommendations. None.


23. Graphic Control Extension.

      a. Description. The Graphic Control Extension contains parameters used
      when processing a graphic rendering block. The scope of this extension is
      the first graphic rendering block to follow. The extension contains only
      one data sub-block.

      This block is OPTIONAL; at most one Graphic Control Extension may precede
      a graphic rendering block. This is the only limit to the number of
      Graphic Control Extensions that may be contained in a Data Stream.

            block. This field contains the fixed value 0x21.

            ii) Graphic Control Label - Identifies the current block as a
            Graphic Control Extension. This field contains the fixed value
            0xF9.

            iii) Block Size - Number of bytes in the block, after the Block
            Size field and up to but not including the Block Terminator.  This
            field contains the fixed value 4.

            iv) Disposal Method - Indicates the way in which the graphic is to
            be treated after being displayed.

            Values :    0 -   No disposal specified. The decoder is
                              not required to take any action.
                        1 -   Do not dispose. The graphic is to be left
                              in place.
                        2 -   Restore to background color. The area used by the
                              graphic must be restored to the background color.
                        3 -   Restore to previous. The decoder is required to
                              restore the area overwritten by the graphic with
                              what was there prior to rendering the graphic.
                     4-7 -    To be defined.

            v) User Input Flag - Indicates whether or not user input is
            expected before continuing. If the flag is set, processing will
            continue when user input is entered. The nature of the User input
            is determined by the application (Carriage Return, Mouse Button
            Click, etc.).

            Values :    0 -   User input is not expected.
                        1 -   User input is expected.

            When a Delay Time is used and the User Input Flag is set,
            processing will continue when user input is received or when the
            delay time expires, whichever occurs first.

            vi) Transparency Flag - Indicates whether a transparency index is
            given in the Transparent Index field. (This field is the least
            significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   Transparent Index is not given.
                        1 -   Transparent Index is given.

            vii) Delay Time - If not 0, this field specifies the number of
            hundredths (1/100) of a second to wait before continuing with the
            processing of the Data Stream. The clock starts ticking immediately
            after the graphic is rendered. This field may be used in
            conjunction with the User Input Flag field.

            viii) Transparency Index - The Transparency Index is such that when
            encountered, the corresponding pixel of the display device is not
            modified and processing goes on to the next pixel. The index is
            present if and only if the Transparency Flag is set to 1.

            ix) Block Terminator - This zero-length data block marks the end of







                                                                        17

            the Graphic Control Extension.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this Extension is the graphic
      rendering block that follows it; it is possible for other extensions to
      be present between this block and its target. This block can modify the
      Image Descriptor Block and the Plain Text Extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Disposal Method - The mode Restore To Previous is intended to be
            used in small sections of the graphic; the use of this mode imposes
            severe demands on the decoder to store the section of the graphic
            that needs to be saved. For this reason, this mode should be used
            sparingly.  This mode is not intended to save an entire graphic or
            large areas of a graphic; when this is the case, the encoder should
            make every attempt to make the sections of the graphic to be
            restored be separate graphics in the data stream. In the case where
            a decoder is not capable of saving an area of a graphic marked as
            Restore To Previous, it is recommended that a decoder restore to
            the background color.

            ii) User Input Flag - When the flag is set, indicating that user
            input is expected, the decoder may sound the bell (0x07) to alert
            the user that input is being expected.  In the absence of a
            specified Delay Time, the decoder should wait for user input
            indefinitely.  It is recommended that the encoder not set the User
            Input Flag without a Delay Time specified.


24. Comment Extension.

      a. Description. The Comment Extension contains textual information which
      is not part of the actual graphics in the GIF Data Stream. It is suitable
      for including comments about the graphics, credits, descriptions or any
      other type of non-control and non-graphic data.  The Comment Extension
      may be ignored by the decoder, or it may be saved for later processing;
      under no circumstances should a Comment Extension disrupt or interfere
      with the processing of the Data Stream.

      This block is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Stream.

            i) Extension Introducer - Identifies the beginning of an extension
            block. This field contains the fixed value 0x21.

            This field contains the fixed value 0xFE.

            iii) Comment Data - Sequence of sub-blocks, each of size at most
            255 bytes and at least 1 byte, with the size in a byte preceding
            the data.  The end of the sequence is marked by the Block
            Terminator.

            the Comment Extension.

      d. Extensions and Scope. This block does not have scope. This block
      cannot be modified by any extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Data - This block is intended for humans.  It should contain
            text using the 7-bit ASCII character set. This block should
            not be used to store control information for custom processing.

            ii) Position - This block may appear at any point in the Data
            Stream at which a block can begin; however, it is recommended that
            Comment Extensions do not interfere with Control or Data blocks;
            they should be located at the beginning or at the end of the Data
            Stream to the extent possible.


25. Plain Text Extension.

      a. Description. The Plain Text Extension contains textual data and the
      parameters necessary to render that data as a graphic, in a simple form.
      The textual data will be encoded with the 7-bit printable ASCII
      characters.  Text data are rendered using a grid of character cells








                                                                        19


      defined by the parameters in the block fields. Each character is rendered
      in an individual cell. The textual data in this block is to be rendered
      as mono-spaced characters, one character per cell, with a best fitting
      font and size. For further information, see the section on
      Recommendations below. The data characters are taken sequentially from
      the data portion of the block and rendered within a cell, starting with
      the upper left cell in the grid and proceeding from left to right and
      from top to bottom. Text data is rendered until the end of data is
      reached or the character grid is filled.  The Character Grid contains an
      integral number of cells; in the case that the cell dimensions do not
      allow for an integral number, fractional cells must be discarded; an
      encoder must be careful to specify the grid dimensions accurately so that
      this does not happen. This block requires a Global Color Table to be
      available; the colors used by this block reference the Global Color Table
      in the Stream if there is one, or the Global Color Table from a previous
      Stream, if one was saved. This block is a graphic rendering block,
      therefore it may be modified by a Graphic Control Extension.  This block
      is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Stream.

      e. Recommendations. The data in the Plain Text Extension is assumed to be
      preformatted. The selection of font and size is left to the discretion of
      the decoder.  If characters less than 0x20 or greater than 0xf7 are
      encountered, it is recommended that the decoder display a Space character
      (0x20). The encoder should use grid and cell dimensions such that an
      integral number of cells fit in the grid both horizontally as well as
      vertically.  For broadest compatibility, character cell dimensions should
      be around 8x8 or 8x16 (width x height); consider an image for unusual
      sized text.

Appendix
B. GIF Grammar.

A Grammar is a form of notation to represent the sequence in which certain
objects form larger objects.  A grammar is also used to represent the number of
objects that can occur at a given position.  The grammar given here represents
the sequence of blocks that form the GIF Data Stream. A grammar is given by
listing its rules.  Each rule consists of the left-hand side, followed by some
form of equals sign, followed by the right-hand side.  In a rule, the
right-hand side describes how the left-hand side is defined. The right-hand
side consists of a sequence of entities, with the possible presence of special
symbols. The following legend defines the symbols used in this grammar for GIF.

Legend:           <>    grammar word
                  ::=   defines symbol
                  *     zero or more occurrences
                  +     one or more occurrences
                  |     alternate element
                  []    optional element

Example:

<GIF Data Stream> ::= Header <Logical Screen> <Data>* Trailer

This rule defines the entity <GIF Data Stream> as follows. It must begin with a
Header. The Header is followed by an entity called Logical Screen, which is
defined below by another rule. The Logical Screen is followed by the entity
Data, which is also defined below by another rule. Finally, the entity Data is
followed by the Trailer.  Since there is no rule defining the Header or the
Trailer, this means that these blocks are defined in the document.  The entity
Data has a special symbol (*) following it which means that, at this position,
the entity Data may be repeated any number of times, including 0 times. For
further reading on this subject, refer to a standard text on Programming
Languages.


The Grammar.

<GIF Data Stream> ::=     Header <Logical Screen> <Data>* Trailer

<Logical Screen> ::=      Logical Screen Descriptor [Global Color Table]

<Data> ::=                <Graphic Block>  |
                          <Special-Purpose Block>

<Graphic Block> ::=       [Graphic Control Extension] <Graphic-Rendering Block>

<Graphic-Rendering Block> ::=  <Table-Based Image>  |
                               Plain Text Extension

<Table-Based Image> ::=   Image Descriptor [Local Color Table] Image Data

<Special-Purpose Block> ::=    Application Extension  |
                               Comment Extension









                                                                        26


NOTE : The grammar indicates that it is possible for a GIF Data Stream to
contain the Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, a Global Color Table and the
GIF Trailer. This special case is used to load a GIF decoder with a Global
Color Table, in preparation for subsequent Data Streams without color tables at
all.

Appendix
C. Glossary.

Active Color Table - Color table used to render the next graphic. If the next
graphic is an image which has a Local Color Table associated with it, the
active color table becomes the Local Color Table associated with that image.
If the next graphic is an image without a Local Color Table, or a Plain Text
Extension, the active color table is the Global Color Table associated with the
Data Stream, if there is one; if there is no Global Color Table in the Data
Stream, the active color table is a color table saved from a previous Data
Stream, or one supplied by the decoder.

Block - Collection of bytes forming a protocol unit. In general, the term
includes labeled and unlabeled blocks, as well as Extensions.

Data Stream - The GIF Data Stream is composed of blocks and sub-blocks
representing images and graphics, together with control information to render
them on a display device. All control and data blocks in the Data Stream must
follow the Header and must precede the Trailer.

Decoder - A program capable of processing a GIF Data Stream to render the
images and graphics contained in it.

Encoder - A program capable of capturing and formatting image and graphic
raster data, following the definitions of the Graphics Interchange Format.

Extension - A protocol block labeled by the Extension Introducer 0x21.

Extension Introducer - Label (0x21) defining an Extension.

Graphic - Data which can be rendered on the screen by virtue of some algorithm.
The term graphic is more general than the term image; in addition to images,
the term graphic also includes data such as text, which is rendered using
character bit-maps.

Image - Data representing a picture or a drawing; an image is represented by an
array of pixels called the raster of the image.

Raster - Array of pixel values representing an image.

Appendix
D. Conventions.

Animation - The Graphics Interchange Format is not intended as a platform for
animation, even though it can be done in a limited way.

Byte Ordering - Unless otherwise stated, multi-byte numeric fields are ordered
with the Least Significant Byte first.

Color Indices - Color indices always refer to the active color table, either
the Global Color Table or the Local Color Table.

Color Order - Unless otherwise stated, all triple-component RGB color values
are specified in Red-Green-Blue order.

Color Tables - Both color tables, the Global and the Local, are optional; if
present, the Global Color Table is to be used with every image in the Data
Stream for which a Local Color Table is not given; if present, a Local Color
Table overrides the Global Color Table.  However, if neither color table is
present, the application program is free to use an arbitrary color table. If
the graphics in several Data Streams are related and all use the same color
table, an encoder could place the color table as the Global Color Table in the
first Data Stream and leave subsequent Data Streams without a Global Color
Table or any Local Color Tables; in this way, the overhead for the table is
eliminated.  It is recommended that the decoder save the previous Global Color
Table to be used with the Data Stream that follows, in case it does not contain
either a Global Color Table or any Local Color Tables. In general, this allows
the application program to use past color tables, significantly reducing
transmission overhead.

Extension Blocks - Extensions are defined using the Extension Introducer code
to mark the beginning of the block, followed by a block label, identifying the
type of extension.  Extension Codes are numbers in the range from 0x00 to 0xFF,
inclusive. Special purpose extensions are transparent to the decoder and may be
omitted when transmitting the Data Stream on-line. The GIF capabilities
dialogue makes the provision for the receiver to request the transmission of
all blocks; the default state in this regard is no transmission of Special
purpose blocks.

Reserved Fields - All Reserved Fields are expected to have each bit set to zero
(off).

E. Interlaced Images.

The rows of an Interlaced images are arranged in the following order:

      Group 1 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 0.              (Pass 1)
      Group 2 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 4.              (Pass 2)
      Group 3 : Every 4th. row, starting with row 2.              (Pass 3)
      Group 4 : Every 2nd. row, starting with row 1.              (Pass 4)

The Following example illustrates how the rows of an interlaced image are
ordered.

Appendix
F. Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression.

The Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression is a variation of the Lempel-Ziv
Compression algorithm in which variable-length codes are used to replace
patterns detected in the original data. The algorithm uses a code or
translation table constructed from the patterns encountered in the original
data; each new pattern is entered into the table and its index is used to
replace it in the compressed stream.

The compressor takes the data from the input stream and builds a code or
translation table with the patterns as it encounters them; each new pattern is
entered into the code table and its index is added to the output stream; when a
pattern is encountered which had been detected since the last code table
refresh, its index from the code table is put on the output stream, thus
achieving the data compression.  The expander takes input from the compressed
data stream and builds the code or translation table from it; as the compressed
data stream is processed, codes are used to index into the code table and the
corresponding data is put on the decompressed output stream, thus achieving
data decompression.  The details of the algorithm are explained below.  The
Variable-Length-Code aspect of the algorithm is based on an initial code size
(LZW-initial code size), which specifies the initial number of bits used for
the compression codes.  When the number of patterns detected by the compressor
in the input stream exceeds the number of patterns encodable with the current
number of bits, the number of bits per LZW code is increased by one.

The Raster Data stream that represents the actual output image can be
represented as:

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
        +---------------+
        | LZW code size |
        +---------------+

        +---------------+ ----+
        |  block size   |     |
        +---------------+     |
        |               |     +-- Repeated as many
        |  data bytes   |     |   times as necessary.
        |               |     |
        +---------------+ ----+

        . . .       . . . ------- The code that terminates the LZW
                                  compressed data must appear before
                                  Block Terminator.
        +---------------+
        |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|  Block Terminator
        +---------------+

The conversion of the image from a series of pixel values to a transmitted or
stored character stream involves several steps. In brief these steps are:

1. Establish the Code Size - Define the number of bits needed to represent the
actual data.

2. Compress the Data - Compress the series of image pixels to a series of







                                                                        31


compression codes.

3. Build a Series of Bytes - Take the set of compression codes and convert to a
string of 8-bit bytes.

4. Package the Bytes - Package sets of bytes into blocks preceded by character
counts and output.

ESTABLISH CODE SIZE

The first byte of the Compressed Data stream is a value indicating the minimum
number of bits required to represent the set of actual pixel values. Normally
this will be the same as the number of color bits. Because of some algorithmic
constraints however, black & white images which have one color bit must be
indicated as having a code size of 2.
This code size value also implies that the compression codes must start out one
bit longer.

COMPRESSION

The LZW algorithm converts a series of data values into a series of codes which
may be raw values or a code designating a series of values. Using text
characters as an analogy, the output code consists of a character or a code
representing a string of characters.

The LZW algorithm used in GIF matches algorithmically with the standard LZW
algorithm with the following differences:

1.  A special Clear code is defined which resets all compression/decompression
parameters and tables to a start-up state. The value of this code is 2**<code
size>. For example if the code size indicated was 4 (image was 4 bits/pixel)
the Clear code value would be 16 (10000 binary). The Clear code can appear at
any point in the image data stream and therefore requires the LZW algorithm to
process succeeding codes as if a new data stream was starting. Encoders should
output a Clear code as the first code of each image data stream.

2. An End of Information code is defined that explicitly indicates the end of
the image data stream. LZW processing terminates when this code is encountered.
It must be the last code output by the encoder for an image. The value of this
code is <Clear code>+1.

3. The first available compression code value is <Clear code>+2.

4. The output codes are of variable length, starting at <code size>+1 bits per
code, up to 12 bits per code. This defines a maximum code value of 4095
(0xFFF). Whenever the LZW code value would exceed the current code length, the
code length is increased by one. The packing/unpacking of these codes must then
be altered to reflect the new code length.

BUILD 8-BIT BYTES

Because the LZW compression used for GIF creates a series of variable length
codes, of between 3 and 12 bits each, these codes must be reformed into a
series of 8-bit bytes that will be the characters actually stored or
transmitted. This provides additional compression of the image. The codes are
formed into a stream of bits as if they were packed right to left and then







                                                                        32


picked off 8 bits at a time to be output.

Assuming a character array of 8 bits per character and using 5 bit codes to be
packed, an example layout would be similar to:


     +---------------+
  0  |               |    bbbaaaaa
     +---------------+
  1  |               |    dcccccbb
     +---------------+
  2  |               |    eeeedddd
     +---------------+
  3  |               |    ggfffffe
     +---------------+
  4  |               |    hhhhhggg
     +---------------+
           . . .
     +---------------+
  N  |               |
     +---------------+


Note that the physical packing arrangement will change as the number of bits
per compression code change but the concept remains the same.

PACKAGE THE BYTES

Once the bytes have been created, they are grouped into blocks for output by
preceding each block of 0 to 255 bytes with a character count byte. A block
with a zero byte count terminates the Raster Data stream for a given image.
These blocks are what are actually output for the GIF image. This block format
has the side effect of allowing a decoding program the ability to read past the
actual image data if necessary by reading block counts and then skipping over
the data.

Appendix
G. On-line Capabilities Dialogue.

NOTE : This section is currently (10 July 1990) under revision; the information
provided here should be used as general guidelines. Code written based on this
information should be designed in a flexible way to accommodate any changes
resulting from the revisions.

The following sequences are defined for use in mediating control between a GIF
sender and GIF receiver over an interactive communications line. These
sequences do not apply to applications that involve downloading of static GIF
files and are not considered part of a GIF file.

GIF CAPABILITIES ENQUIRY

The GIF Capabilities Enquiry sequence is issued from a host and requests an
interactive GIF decoder to return a response message that defines the graphics
parameters for the decoder. This involves returning information about available
screen sizes, number of bits/color supported and the amount of color detail
supported. The escape sequence for the GIF Capabilities Enquiry is defined as:

ESC[>0g           0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x30 0x67

GIF CAPABILITIES RESPONSE

The GIF Capabilities Response message is returned by an interactive GIF decoder
and defines the decoder's display capabilities for all graphics modes that are
supported by the software. Note that this can also include graphics printers as
well as a monitor screen. The general format of this message is:

#version;protocol{;dev, width, height, color-bits, color-res}...<CR>


'#'            GIF Capabilities Response identifier character.
version        GIF format version number;  initially '87a'.
protocol='0'   No end-to-end protocol supported by decoder Transfer as direct
               8-bit data stream.
protocol='1'   Can use CIS B+ error correction protocol to transfer GIF data
               interactively from the host directly to the display.
dev = '0'      Screen parameter set follows.
dev = '1'      Printer parameter set follows.
width          Maximum supported display width in pixels.
height         Maximum supported display height in pixels.
color-bits     Number of bits per pixel supported. The number of supported
               colors is therefore 2**color-bits.
color-res      Number of bits per color component supported in the hardware
               color palette. If color-res is '0' then no hardware palette
               table is available.

Note that all values in the GIF Capabilities Response are returned as ASCII
decimal numbers and the message is terminated by a Carriage Return character.

The following GIF Capabilities Response message describes three standard IBM PC
Enhanced Graphics Adapter configurations with no printer; the GIF data stream









                                                                        34


can be processed within an error correcting protocol:

#87a;1;0,320,200,4,0;0,640,200,2,2;0,640,350,4,2<CR>

ENTER GIF GRAPHICS MODE

Two sequences are currently defined to invoke an interactive GIF decoder into
action. The only difference between them is that different output media are
selected. These sequences are:

ESC[>1g     Display GIF image on screen

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x31 0x67

ESC[>2g   Display image directly to an attached graphics printer. The image may
optionally be displayed on the screen as well.

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x32 0x67

Note that the 'g' character terminating each sequence is in lowercase.

INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT

The assumed environment for the transmission of GIF image data from an
interactive application is a full 8-bit data stream from host to micro.  All
256 character codes must be transferrable. The establishing of an 8-bit data
path for communications will normally be taken care of by the host application
programs. It is however up to the receiving communications programs supporting
GIF to be able to receive and pass on all 256 8-bit codes to the GIF decoder
software.

CHANGE LOG for Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software


Version 6b  27-Mar-1998
-----------------------

jpegtran has new features for lossless image transformations (rotation
and flipping) as well as "lossless" reduction to grayscale.

jpegtran now copies comments by default; it has a -copy switch to enable
copying all APPn blocks as well, or to suppress comments.  (Formerly it
always suppressed comments and APPn blocks.)  jpegtran now also preserves
JFIF version and resolution information.

New decompressor library feature: COM and APPn markers found in the input
file can be saved in memory for later use by the application.  (Before,
you had to code this up yourself with a custom marker processor.)

There is an unused field "void * client_data" now in compress and decompress
parameter structs; this may be useful in some applications.

JFIF version number information is now saved by the decoder and accepted by
the encoder.  jpegtran uses this to copy the source file's version number,
to ensure "jpegtran -copy all" won't create bogus files that contain JFXX
extensions but claim to be version 1.01.  Applications that generate their
own JFXX extension markers also (finally) have a supported way to cause the
encoder to emit JFIF version number 1.02.

djpeg's trace mode reports JFIF 1.02 thumbnail images as such, rather
than as unknown APP0 markers.

In -verbose mode, djpeg and rdjpgcom will try to print the contents of
APP12 markers as text.  Some digital cameras store useful text information
in APP12 markers.

Handling of truncated data streams is more robust: blocks beyond the one in
which the error occurs will be output as uniform gray, or left unchanged
if decoding a progressive JPEG.  The appearance no longer depends on the
Huffman tables being used.

Huffman tables are checked for validity much more carefully than before.

To avoid the Unisys LZW patent, djpeg's GIF output capability has been
changed to produce "uncompressed GIFs", and cjpeg's GIF input capability
has been removed altogether.  We're not happy about it either, but there
seems to be no good alternative.

The configure script now supports building libjpeg as a shared library
on many flavors of Unix (all the ones that GNU libtool knows how to
build shared libraries for).  Use "./configure --enable-shared" to
try this out.

New jconfig file and makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ and Developer Studio.
Also, a jconfig file and a build script for Metrowerks CodeWarrior
on Apple Macintosh.  makefile.dj has been updated for DJGPP v2, and there
are miscellaneous other minor improvements in the makefiles.

jmemmac.c now knows how to create temporary files following Mac System 7
conventions.

djpeg's -map switch is now able to read raw-format PPM files reliably.

cjpeg -progressive -restart no longer generates any unnecessary DRI markers.

Multiple calls to jpeg_simple_progression for a single JPEG object
no longer leak memory.


Version 6a  7-Feb-96
--------------------

Library initialization sequence modified to detect version mismatches
and struct field packing mismatches between library and calling application.
This change requires applications to be recompiled, but does not require
any application source code change.

All routine declarations changed to the style "GLOBAL(type) name ...",
that is, GLOBAL, LOCAL, METHODDEF, EXTERN are now macros taking the
routine's return type as an argument.  This makes it possible to add
Microsoft-style linkage keywords to all the routines by changing just
these macros.  Note that any application code that was using these macros
will have to be changed.

DCT coefficient quantization tables are now stored in normal array order
rather than zigzag order.  Application code that calls jpeg_add_quant_table,
or otherwise manipulates quantization tables directly, will need to be
changed.  If you need to make such code work with either older or newer
versions of the library, a test like "#if JPEG_LIB_VERSION >= 61" is
recommended.

djpeg's trace capability now dumps DQT tables in natural order, not zigzag
order.  This allows the trace output to be made into a "-qtables" file
more easily.

New system-dependent memory manager module for use on Apple Macintosh.

Fix bug in cjpeg's -smooth option: last one or two scanlines would be
duplicates of the prior line unless the image height mod 16 was 1 or 2.

Repair minor problems in VMS, BCC, MC6 makefiles.

New configure script based on latest GNU Autoconf.

Correct the list of include files needed by MetroWerks C for ccommand().

Numerous small documentation updates.


Version 6  2-Aug-95
-------------------

Progressive JPEG support: library can read and write full progressive JPEG
files.  A "buffered image" mode supports incremental decoding for on-the-fly
display of progressive images.  Simply recompiling an existing IJG-v5-based
decoder with v6 should allow it to read progressive files, though of course
without any special progressive display.

New "jpegtran" application performs lossless transcoding between different
JPEG formats; primarily, it can be used to convert baseline to progressive
JPEG and vice versa.  In support of jpegtran, the library now allows lossless
reading and writing of JPEG files as DCT coefficient arrays.  This ability
may be of use in other applications.

Notes for programmers:
* We changed jpeg_start_decompress() to be able to suspend; this makes all
decoding modes available to suspending-input applications.  However,
existing applications that use suspending input will need to be changed
to check the return value from jpeg_start_decompress().  You don't need to
do anything if you don't use a suspending data source.
* We changed the interface to the virtual array routines: access_virt_array
routines now take a count of the number of rows to access this time.  The
last parameter to request_virt_array routines is now interpreted as the
maximum number of rows that may be accessed at once, but not necessarily
the height of every access.


Version 5b  15-Mar-95
---------------------

Correct bugs with grayscale images having v_samp_factor > 1.

jpeg_write_raw_data() now supports output suspension.

Correct bugs in "configure" script for case of compiling in
a directory other than the one containing the source files.

Repair bug in jquant1.c: sometimes didn't use as many colors as it could.

Borland C makefile and jconfig file work under either MS-DOS or OS/2.

Miscellaneous improvements to documentation.


Version 5a  7-Dec-94
--------------------

Changed color conversion roundoff behavior so that grayscale values are
represented exactly.  (This causes test image files to change.)

Make ordered dither use 16x16 instead of 4x4 pattern for a small quality
improvement.

New configure script based on latest GNU Autoconf.
Fix configure script to handle CFLAGS correctly.
Rename *.auto files to *.cfg, so that configure script still works if
file names have been truncated for DOS.

Fix bug in rdbmp.c: didn't allow for extra data between header and image.

Modify rdppm.c/wrppm.c to handle 2-byte raw PPM/PGM formats for 12-bit data.

Fix several bugs in rdrle.c.

NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES option was broken.

Revise jerror.h/jerror.c for more flexibility in message table.

Repair oversight in jmemname.c NO_MKTEMP case: file could be there
but unreadable.


Version 5  24-Sep-94
--------------------

Version 5 represents a nearly complete redesign and rewrite of the IJG
software.  Major user-visible changes include:
  * Automatic configuration simplifies installation for most Unix systems.
  * A range of speed vs. image quality tradeoffs are supported.
    This includes resizing of an image during decompression: scaling down
    by a factor of 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8 is handled very efficiently.
  * New programs rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom allow insertion and extraction
    of text comments in a JPEG file.

The application programmer's interface to the library has changed completely.
Notable improvements include:
  * We have eliminated the use of callback routines for handling the
    uncompressed image data.  The application now sees the library as a
    set of routines that it calls to read or write image data on a
    scanline-by-scanline basis.
  * The application image data is represented in a conventional interleaved-
    pixel format, rather than as a separate array for each color channel.
    This can save a copying step in many programs.
  * The handling of compressed data has been cleaned up: the application can
    supply routines to source or sink the compressed data.  It is possible to
    suspend processing on source/sink buffer overrun, although this is not
    supported in all operating modes.
  * All static state has been eliminated from the library, so that multiple
    instances of compression or decompression can be active concurrently.
  * JPEG abbreviated datastream formats are supported, ie, quantization and
    Huffman tables can be stored separately from the image data.
  * And not only that, but the documentation of the library has improved
    considerably!


The last widely used release before the version 5 rewrite was version 4A of
18-Feb-93.  Change logs before that point have been discarded, since they
are not of much interest after the rewrite.

IJG JPEG LIBRARY:  CODING RULES

Copyright (C) 1991-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.


Since numerous people will be contributing code and bug fixes, it's important
to establish a common coding style.  The goal of using similar coding styles
is much more important than the details of just what that style is.

In general we follow the recommendations of "Recommended C Style and Coding
Standards" revision 6.1 (Cannon et al. as modified by Spencer, Keppel and
Brader).  This document is available in the IJG FTP archive (see
jpeg/doc/cstyle.ms.tbl.Z, or cstyle.txt.Z for those without nroff/tbl).

Block comments should be laid out thusly:

/*
 *  Block comments in this style.
 */

We indent statements in K&R style, e.g.,
	if (test) {
	  then-part;
	} else {
	  else-part;
	}
with two spaces per indentation level.  (This indentation convention is
handled automatically by GNU Emacs and many other text editors.)

Multi-word names should be written in lower case with underscores, e.g.,
multi_word_name (not multiWordName).  Preprocessor symbols and enum constants
are similar but upper case (MULTI_WORD_NAME).  Names should be unique within
the first fifteen characters.  (On some older systems, global names must be
unique within six characters.  We accommodate this without cluttering the
source code by using macros to substitute shorter names.)

We use function prototypes everywhere; we rely on automatic source code
transformation to feed prototype-less C compilers.  Transformation is done
by the simple and portable tool 'ansi2knr.c' (courtesy of Ghostscript).
ansi2knr is not very bright, so it imposes a format requirement on function
declarations: the function name MUST BEGIN IN COLUMN 1.  Thus all functions
should be written in the following style:

LOCAL(int *)
function_name (int a, char *b)
{
    code...
}

Note that each function definition must begin with GLOBAL(type), LOCAL(type),
or METHODDEF(type).  These macros expand to "static type" or just "type" as
appropriate.  They provide a readable indication of the routine's usage and
can readily be changed for special needs.  (For instance, special linkage
keywords can be inserted for use in Windows DLLs.)

ansi2knr does not transform method declarations (function pointers in
structs).  We handle these with a macro JMETHOD, defined as
	#ifdef HAVE_PROTOTYPES
	#define JMETHOD(type,methodname,arglist)  type (*methodname) arglist
	#else
	#define JMETHOD(type,methodname,arglist)  type (*methodname) ()
	#endif
which is used like this:
	struct function_pointers {
	  JMETHOD(void, init_entropy_encoder, (int somearg, jparms *jp));
	  JMETHOD(void, term_entropy_encoder, (void));
	};
Note the set of parentheses surrounding the parameter list.

A similar solution is used for forward and external function declarations
(see the EXTERN and JPP macros).

If the code is to work on non-ANSI compilers, we cannot rely on a prototype
declaration to coerce actual parameters into the right types.  Therefore, use
explicit casts on actual parameters whenever the actual parameter type is not
identical to the formal parameter.  Beware of implicit conversions to "int".

It seems there are some non-ANSI compilers in which the sizeof() operator
is defined to return int, yet size_t is defined as long.  Needless to say,
this is brain-damaged.  Always use the SIZEOF() macro in place of sizeof(),
so that the result is guaranteed to be of type size_t.


The JPEG library is intended to be used within larger programs.  Furthermore,
we want it to be reentrant so that it can be used by applications that process
multiple images concurrently.  The following rules support these requirements:

1. Avoid direct use of file I/O, "malloc", error report printouts, etc;
pass these through the common routines provided.

2. Minimize global namespace pollution.  Functions should be declared static
wherever possible.  (Note that our method-based calling conventions help this
a lot: in many modules only the initialization function will ever need to be
called directly, so only that function need be externally visible.)  All
global function names should begin with "jpeg_", and should have an
abbreviated name (unique in the first six characters) substituted by macro
when NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES is set.

3. Don't use global variables; anything that must be used in another module
should be in the common data structures.

4. Don't use static variables except for read-only constant tables.  Variables
that should be private to a module can be placed into private structures (see
the system architecture document, structure.doc).

5. Source file names should begin with "j" for files that are part of the
library proper; source files that are not part of the library, such as cjpeg.c
and djpeg.c, do not begin with "j".  Keep source file names to eight
characters (plus ".c" or ".h", etc) to make life easy for MS-DOSers.  Keep
compression and decompression code in separate source files --- some
applications may want only one half of the library.

Note: these rules (particularly #4) are not followed religiously in the
modules that are used in cjpeg/djpeg but are not part of the JPEG library
proper.  Those modules are not really intended to be used in other
applications.

IJG JPEG LIBRARY:  FILE LIST

Copyright (C) 1994-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.


Here is a road map to the files in the IJG JPEG distribution.  The
distribution includes the JPEG library proper, plus two application
programs ("cjpeg" and "djpeg") which use the library to convert JPEG
files to and from some other popular image formats.  A third application
"jpegtran" uses the library to do lossless conversion between different
variants of JPEG.  There are also two stand-alone applications,
"rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom".


THE JPEG LIBRARY
================

Include files:

jpeglib.h	JPEG library's exported data and function declarations.
jconfig.h	Configuration declarations.  Note: this file is not present
		in the distribution; it is generated during installation.
jmorecfg.h	Additional configuration declarations; need not be changed
		for a standard installation.
jerror.h	Declares JPEG library's error and trace message codes.
jinclude.h	Central include file used by all IJG .c files to reference
		system include files.
jpegint.h	JPEG library's internal data structures.
jchuff.h	Private declarations for Huffman encoder modules.
jdhuff.h	Private declarations for Huffman decoder modules.
jdct.h		Private declarations for forward & reverse DCT subsystems.
jmemsys.h	Private declarations for memory management subsystem.
jversion.h	Version information.

Applications using the library should include jpeglib.h (which in turn
includes jconfig.h and jmorecfg.h).  Optionally, jerror.h may be included
if the application needs to reference individual JPEG error codes.  The
other include files are intended for internal use and would not normally
be included by an application program.  (cjpeg/djpeg/etc do use jinclude.h,
since its function is to improve portability of the whole IJG distribution.
Most other applications will directly include the system include files they
want, and hence won't need jinclude.h.)


C source code files:

These files contain most of the functions intended to be called directly by
an application program:

jcapimin.c	Application program interface: core routines for compression.
jcapistd.c	Application program interface: standard compression.
jdapimin.c	Application program interface: core routines for decompression.
jdapistd.c	Application program interface: standard decompression.
jcomapi.c	Application program interface routines common to compression
		and decompression.
jcparam.c	Compression parameter setting helper routines.
jctrans.c	API and library routines for transcoding compression.
jdtrans.c	API and library routines for transcoding decompression.

Compression side of the library:

jcinit.c	Initialization: determines which other modules to use.
jcmaster.c	Master control: setup and inter-pass sequencing logic.
jcmainct.c	Main buffer controller (preprocessor => JPEG compressor).
jcprepct.c	Preprocessor buffer controller.
jccoefct.c	Buffer controller for DCT coefficient buffer.
jccolor.c	Color space conversion.
jcsample.c	Downsampling.
jcdctmgr.c	DCT manager (DCT implementation selection & control).
jfdctint.c	Forward DCT using slow-but-accurate integer method.
jfdctfst.c	Forward DCT using faster, less accurate integer method.
jfdctflt.c	Forward DCT using floating-point arithmetic.
jchuff.c	Huffman entropy coding for sequential JPEG.
jcphuff.c	Huffman entropy coding for progressive JPEG.
jcmarker.c	JPEG marker writing.
jdatadst.c	Data destination manager for stdio output.

Decompression side of the library:

jdmaster.c	Master control: determines which other modules to use.
jdinput.c	Input controller: controls input processing modules.
jdmainct.c	Main buffer controller (JPEG decompressor => postprocessor).
jdcoefct.c	Buffer controller for DCT coefficient buffer.
jdpostct.c	Postprocessor buffer controller.
jdmarker.c	JPEG marker reading.
jdhuff.c	Huffman entropy decoding for sequential JPEG.
jdphuff.c	Huffman entropy decoding for progressive JPEG.
jddctmgr.c	IDCT manager (IDCT implementation selection & control).
jidctint.c	Inverse DCT using slow-but-accurate integer method.
jidctfst.c	Inverse DCT using faster, less accurate integer method.
jidctflt.c	Inverse DCT using floating-point arithmetic.
jidctred.c	Inverse DCTs with reduced-size outputs.
jdsample.c	Upsampling.
jdcolor.c	Color space conversion.
jdmerge.c	Merged upsampling/color conversion (faster, lower quality).
jquant1.c	One-pass color quantization using a fixed-spacing colormap.
jquant2.c	Two-pass color quantization using a custom-generated colormap.
		Also handles one-pass quantization to an externally given map.
jdatasrc.c	Data source manager for stdio input.

Support files for both compression and decompression:

jerror.c	Standard error handling routines (application replaceable).
jmemmgr.c	System-independent (more or less) memory management code.
jutils.c	Miscellaneous utility routines.

jmemmgr.c relies on a system-dependent memory management module.  The IJG
distribution includes the following implementations of the system-dependent
module:

jmemnobs.c	"No backing store": assumes adequate virtual memory exists.
jmemansi.c	Makes temporary files with ANSI-standard routine tmpfile().
jmemname.c	Makes temporary files with program-generated file names.
jmemdos.c	Custom implementation for MS-DOS (16-bit environment only):
		can use extended and expanded memory as well as temp files.
jmemmac.c	Custom implementation for Apple Macintosh.

Exactly one of the system-dependent modules should be configured into an
installed JPEG library (see install.doc for hints about which one to use).
On unusual systems you may find it worthwhile to make a special
system-dependent memory manager.


Non-C source code files:

jmemdosa.asm	80x86 assembly code support for jmemdos.c; used only in
		MS-DOS-specific configurations of the JPEG library.

		Also used by jpegtran.
transupp.c	Support code for jpegtran: lossless image manipulations.

Image file reader modules for cjpeg:

rdbmp.c		BMP file input.
rdgif.c		GIF file input (now just a stub).
rdppm.c		PPM/PGM file input.
rdrle.c		Utah RLE file input.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software

Copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.


This file explains how to configure and install the IJG software.  We have
tried to make this software extremely portable and flexible, so that it can be
adapted to almost any environment.  The downside of this decision is that the
installation process is complicated.  We have provided shortcuts to simplify
the task on common systems.  But in any case, you will need at least a little
familiarity with C programming and program build procedures for your system.

If you are only using this software as part of a larger program, the larger
program's installation procedure may take care of configuring the IJG code.
For example, Ghostscript's installation script will configure the IJG code.
You don't need to read this file if you just want to compile Ghostscript.

If you are on a Unix machine, you may not need to read this file at all.
Try doing
	./configure
	make
	make test
If that doesn't complain, do
	make install
(better do "make -n install" first to see if the makefile will put the files
where you want them).  Read further if you run into snags or want to customize
the code for your system.

BEFORE YOU START
================

Before installing the software you must unpack the distributed source code.
Since you are reading this file, you have probably already succeeded in this
task.  However, there is a potential for error if you needed to convert the
files to the local standard text file format (for example, if you are on
MS-DOS you may have converted LF end-of-line to CR/LF).  You must apply
such conversion to all the files EXCEPT those whose names begin with "test".
The test files contain binary data; if you change them in any way then the
self-test will give bad results.

Please check the last section of this file to see if there are hints for the
specific machine or compiler you are using.


CONFIGURING THE SOFTWARE
========================

To configure the IJG code for your system, you need to create two files:
  * jconfig.h: contains values for system-dependent #define symbols.
  * Makefile: controls the compilation process.
(On a non-Unix machine, you may create "project files" or some other
substitute for a Makefile.  jconfig.h is needed in any environment.)

We provide three different ways to generate these files:
  * On a Unix system, you can just run the "configure" script.
  * We provide sample jconfig files and makefiles for popular machines;
    if your machine matches one of the samples, just copy the right sample
    files to jconfig.h and Makefile.
  * If all else fails, read the instructions below and make your own files.


Configuring the software using the automatic "configure" script
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on a Unix machine, you can just type
	./configure
and let the configure script construct appropriate configuration files.
If you're using "csh" on an old version of System V, you might need to type
	sh configure
instead to prevent csh from trying to execute configure itself.
Expect configure to run for a few minutes, particularly on slower machines;
it works by compiling a series of test programs.

Configure was created with GNU Autoconf and it follows the usual conventions
for GNU configure scripts.  It makes a few assumptions that you may want to
override.  You can do this by providing optional switches to configure:

* If you want to build libjpeg as a shared library, say
	./configure --enable-shared
To get both shared and static libraries, say
	./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
Note that these switches invoke GNU libtool to take care of system-dependent
shared library building methods.  If things don't work this way, please try
running configure without either switch; that should build a static library
without using libtool.  If that works, your problem is probably with libtool
not with the IJG code.  libtool is fairly new and doesn't support all flavors
of Unix yet.  (You might be able to find a newer version of libtool than the
one included with libjpeg; see ftp.gnu.org.  Report libtool problems to
bug-libtool@gnu.org.)

* Configure will use gcc (GNU C compiler) if it's available, otherwise cc.
To force a particular compiler to be selected, use the CC option, for example
	./configure CC='cc'
The same method can be used to include any unusual compiler switches.
For example, on HP-UX you probably want to say
	./configure CC='cc -Aa'
to get HP's compiler to run in ANSI mode.

* The default CFLAGS setting is "-O" for non-gcc compilers, "-O2" for gcc.
You can override this by saying, for example,
	./configure CFLAGS='-g'
if you want to compile with debugging support.

* Configure will set up the makefile so that "make install" will install files
into /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man, etc.  You can specify an installation
prefix other than "/usr/local" by giving configure the option "--prefix=PATH".

* If you don't have a lot of swap space, you may need to enable the IJG
software's internal virtual memory mechanism.  To do this, give the option
"--enable-maxmem=N" where N is the default maxmemory limit in megabytes.
This is discussed in more detail under "Selecting a memory manager", below.
You probably don't need to worry about this on reasonably-sized Unix machines,
unless you plan to process very large images.

Configure has some other features that are useful if you are cross-compiling
or working in a network of multiple machine types; but if you need those
features, you probably already know how to use them.


Configuring the software using one of the supplied jconfig and makefile files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have one of these systems, you can just use the provided configuration
files:

Makefile	jconfig file	System and/or compiler

makefile.manx	jconfig.manx	Amiga, Manx Aztec C
makefile.sas	jconfig.sas	Amiga, SAS C
makeproj.mac	jconfig.mac	Apple Macintosh, Metrowerks CodeWarrior
mak*jpeg.st	jconfig.st	Atari ST/STE/TT, Pure C or Turbo C
makefile.bcc	jconfig.bcc	MS-DOS or OS/2, Borland C
makefile.dj	jconfig.dj	MS-DOS, DJGPP (Delorie's port of GNU C)
makefile.mc6	jconfig.mc6	MS-DOS, Microsoft C (16-bit only)
makefile.wat	jconfig.wat	MS-DOS, OS/2, or Windows NT, Watcom C
makefile.vc	jconfig.vc	Windows NT/95, MS Visual C++
make*.ds	jconfig.vc	Windows NT/95, MS Developer Studio
makefile.mms	jconfig.vms	Digital VMS, with MMS software
makefile.vms	jconfig.vms	Digital VMS, without MMS software

Copy the proper jconfig file to jconfig.h and the makefile to Makefile (or
whatever your system uses as the standard makefile name).  For more info see
the appropriate system-specific hints section near the end of this file.


Configuring the software by hand
--------------------------------

First, generate a jconfig.h file.  If you are moderately familiar with C,
the comments in jconfig.doc should be enough information to do this; just
copy jconfig.doc to jconfig.h and edit it appropriately.  Otherwise, you may
prefer to use the ckconfig.c program.  You will need to compile and execute
ckconfig.c by hand --- we hope you know at least enough to do that.
ckconfig.c may not compile the first try (in fact, the whole idea is for it
to fail if anything is going to).  If you get compile errors, fix them by
editing ckconfig.c according to the directions given in ckconfig.c.  Once
you get it to run, it will write a suitable jconfig.h file, and will also
print out some advice about which makefile to use.

You may also want to look at the canned jconfig files, if there is one for a
system similar to yours.

Second, select a makefile and copy it to Makefile (or whatever your system
uses as the standard makefile name).  The most generic makefiles we provide
are
	makefile.ansi:	if your C compiler supports function prototypes
	makefile.unix:	if not.
(You have function prototypes if ckconfig.c put "#define HAVE_PROTOTYPES"
in jconfig.h.)  You may want to start from one of the other makefiles if
there is one for a system similar to yours.

Look over the selected Makefile and adjust options as needed.  In particular
you may want to change the CC and CFLAGS definitions.  For instance, if you
are using GCC, set CC=gcc.  If you had to use any compiler switches to get
ckconfig.c to work, make sure the same switches are in CFLAGS.

If you are on a system that doesn't use makefiles, you'll need to set up
project files (or whatever you do use) to compile all the source files and
link them into executable files cjpeg, djpeg, jpegtran, rdjpgcom, and wrjpgcom.
See the file lists in any of the makefiles to find out which files go into
each program.  Note that the provided makefiles all make a "library" file
libjpeg first, but you don't have to do that if you don't want to; the file
lists identify which source files are actually needed for compression,
decompression, or both.  As a last resort, you can make a batch script that
just compiles everything and links it all together; makefile.vms is an example
of this (it's for VMS systems that have no make-like utility).

Here are comments about some specific configuration decisions you'll
need to make:

Command line style
------------------

These programs can use a Unix-like command line style which supports
redirection and piping, like this:
	cjpeg inputfile >outputfile
	cjpeg <inputfile >outputfile
	source program | cjpeg >outputfile
The simpler "two file" command line style is just
	cjpeg inputfile outputfile
You may prefer the two-file style, particularly if you don't have pipes.

You MUST use two-file style on any system that doesn't cope well with binary
data fed through stdin/stdout; this is true for some MS-DOS compilers, for
example.  If you're not on a Unix system, it's safest to assume you need
two-file style.  (But if your compiler provides either the Posix-standard
fdopen() library routine or a Microsoft-compatible setmode() routine, you
can safely use the Unix command line style, by defining USE_FDOPEN or
USE_SETMODE respectively.)

To use the two-file style, make jconfig.h say "#define TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE".

Selecting a memory manager
--------------------------

The IJG code is capable of working on images that are too big to fit in main
memory; data is swapped out to temporary files as necessary.  However, the
code to do this is rather system-dependent.  We provide five different
memory managers:

* jmemansi.c	This version uses the ANSI-standard library routine tmpfile(),
		which not all non-ANSI systems have.  On some systems
		tmpfile() may put the temporary file in a non-optimal
		location; if you don't like what it does, use jmemname.c.

* jmemname.c	This version creates named temporary files.  For anything
		except a Unix machine, you'll need to configure the
		select_file_name() routine appropriately; see the comments
		near the head of jmemname.c.  If you use this version, define
		NEED_SIGNAL_CATCHER in jconfig.h to make sure the temp files
		are removed if the program is aborted.

* jmemnobs.c	(That stands for No Backing Store :-).)  This will compile on
		almost any system, but it assumes you have enough main memory
		or virtual memory to hold the biggest images you work with.

* jmemdos.c	This should be used with most 16-bit MS-DOS compilers.
		See the system-specific notes about MS-DOS for more info.
		IMPORTANT: if you use this, define USE_MSDOS_MEMMGR in
		jconfig.h, and include the assembly file jmemdosa.asm in the
		programs.  The supplied makefiles and jconfig files for
		16-bit MS-DOS compilers already do both.

* jmemmac.c	Custom version for Apple Macintosh; see the system-specific
		notes for Macintosh for more info.

To use a particular memory manager, change the SYSDEPMEM variable in your
makefile to equal the corresponding object file name (for example, jmemansi.o
or jmemansi.obj for jmemansi.c).

If you have plenty of (real or virtual) main memory, just use jmemnobs.c.
"Plenty" means about ten bytes for every pixel in the largest images
you plan to process, so a lot of systems don't meet this criterion.
If yours doesn't, try jmemansi.c first.  If that doesn't compile, you'll have
to use jmemname.c; be sure to adjust select_file_name() for local conditions.
You may also need to change unlink() to remove() in close_backing_store().

Except with jmemnobs.c or jmemmac.c, you need to adjust the DEFAULT_MAX_MEM
setting to a reasonable value for your system (either by adding a #define for
DEFAULT_MAX_MEM to jconfig.h, or by adding a -D switch to the Makefile).
This value limits the amount of data space the program will attempt to
allocate.  Code and static data space isn't counted, so the actual memory
needs for cjpeg or djpeg are typically 100 to 150Kb more than the max-memory
setting.  Larger max-memory settings reduce the amount of I/O needed to
process a large image, but too large a value can result in "insufficient
memory" failures.  On most Unix machines (and other systems with virtual
memory), just set DEFAULT_MAX_MEM to several million and forget it.  At the
other end of the spectrum, for MS-DOS machines you probably can't go much
above 300K to 400K.  (On MS-DOS the value refers to conventional memory only.
Extended/expanded memory is handled separately by jmemdos.c.)


BUILDING THE SOFTWARE
=====================

Now you should be able to compile the software.  Just say "make" (or
whatever's necessary to start the compilation).  Have a cup of coffee.

Here are some things that could go wrong:

If your compiler complains about undefined structures, you should be able to
shut it up by putting "#define INCOMPLETE_TYPES_BROKEN" in jconfig.h.

If you have trouble with missing system include files or inclusion of the
wrong ones, read jinclude.h.  This shouldn't happen if you used configure
or ckconfig.c to set up jconfig.h.

There are a fair number of routines that do not use all of their parameters;
some compilers will issue warnings about this, which you can ignore.  There
are also a few configuration checks that may give "unreachable code" warnings.
Any other warning deserves investigation.

If you don't have a getenv() library routine, define NO_GETENV.

Also see the system-specific hints, below.


TESTING THE SOFTWARE
====================

As a quick test of functionality we've included a small sample image in
several forms:
	testorig.jpg	Starting point for the djpeg tests.
	testimg.ppm	The output of djpeg testorig.jpg
	testimg.bmp	The output of djpeg -bmp -colors 256 testorig.jpg
	testimg.jpg	The output of cjpeg testimg.ppm
	testprog.jpg	Progressive-mode equivalent of testorig.jpg.
	testimgp.jpg	The output of cjpeg -progressive -optimize testimg.ppm
(The first- and second-generation .jpg files aren't identical since JPEG is
lossy.)  If you can generate duplicates of the testimg* files then you
probably have working programs.

With most of the makefiles, "make test" will perform the necessary
comparisons.

If you're using a makefile that doesn't provide the test option, run djpeg
and cjpeg by hand and compare the output files to testimg* with whatever
binary file comparison tool you have.  The files should be bit-for-bit
identical.

If the programs complain "MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK is wrong, please fix", then you
need to reduce MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK to a value that fits in type size_t.
Try adding "#define MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK 65520L" to jconfig.h.  A less likely
configuration error is "ALIGN_TYPE is wrong, please fix": defining ALIGN_TYPE
as long should take care of that one.

If the cjpeg test run fails with "Missing Huffman code table entry", it's a
good bet that you needed to define RIGHT_SHIFT_IS_UNSIGNED.  Go back to the
configuration step and run ckconfig.c.  (This is a good plan for any other
test failure, too.)

If you are using Unix (one-file) command line style on a non-Unix system,
it's a good idea to check that binary I/O through stdin/stdout actually
works.  You should get the same results from "djpeg <testorig.jpg >out.ppm"
as from "djpeg -outfile out.ppm testorig.jpg".  Note that the makefiles all
use the latter style and therefore do not exercise stdin/stdout!  If this
check fails, try recompiling with USE_SETMODE or USE_FDOPEN defined.
If it still doesn't work, better use two-file style.

If you chose a memory manager other than jmemnobs.c, you should test that
temporary-file usage works.  Try "djpeg -bmp -colors 256 -max 0 testorig.jpg"
and make sure its output matches testimg.bmp.  If you have any really large
images handy, try compressing them with -optimize and/or decompressing with
-colors 256 to make sure your DEFAULT_MAX_MEM setting is not too large.

NOTE: this is far from an exhaustive test of the JPEG software; some modules,
such as 1-pass color quantization, are not exercised at all.  It's just a
quick test to give you some confidence that you haven't missed something
major.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
=======================

Once you're done with the above steps, you can install the software by
copying the executable files (cjpeg, djpeg, jpegtran, rdjpgcom, and wrjpgcom)
to wherever you normally install programs.  On Unix systems, you'll also want
to put the man pages (cjpeg.1, djpeg.1, jpegtran.1, rdjpgcom.1, wrjpgcom.1)
in the man-page directory.  The pre-fab makefiles don't support this step
since there's such a wide variety of installation procedures on different
systems.

If you generated a Makefile with the "configure" script, you can just say
	make install
to install the programs and their man pages into the standard places.
(You'll probably need to be root to do this.)  We recommend first saying
	make -n install
to see where configure thought the files should go.  You may need to edit
the Makefile, particularly if your system's conventions for man page
filenames don't match what configure expects.

If you want to install the IJG library itself, for use in compiling other
programs besides ours, then you need to put the four include files
	jpeglib.h jerror.h jconfig.h jmorecfg.h
into your include-file directory, and put the library file libjpeg.a
(extension may vary depending on system) wherever library files go.
If you generated a Makefile with "configure", it will do what it thinks
is the right thing if you say
	make install-lib


OPTIONAL STUFF
==============

Progress monitor:

If you like, you can #define PROGRESS_REPORT (in jconfig.h) to enable display
of percent-done progress reports.  The routine provided in cdjpeg.c merely
prints percentages to stderr, but you can customize it to do something
fancier.

Utah RLE file format support:

We distribute the software with support for RLE image files (Utah Raster
Toolkit format) disabled, because the RLE support won't compile without the
Utah library.  If you have URT version 3.1 or later, you can enable RLE
support as follows:
	1.  #define RLE_SUPPORTED in jconfig.h.
	2.  Add a -I option to CFLAGS in the Makefile for the directory
	    containing the URT .h files (typically the "include"
	    subdirectory of the URT distribution).
	3.  Add -L... -lrle to LDLIBS in the Makefile, where ... specifies
	    the directory containing the URT "librle.a" file (typically the
	    "lib" subdirectory of the URT distribution).

Support for 12-bit-deep pixel data:

The JPEG standard allows either 8-bit or 12-bit data precision.  (For color,
this means 8 or 12 bits per channel, of course.)  If you need to work with
deeper than 8-bit data, you can compile the IJG code for 12-bit operation.
To do so:
  1. In jmorecfg.h, define BITS_IN_JSAMPLE as 12 rather than 8.
  2. In jconfig.h, undefine BMP_SUPPORTED, RLE_SUPPORTED, and TARGA_SUPPORTED,
     because the code for those formats doesn't handle 12-bit data and won't
     even compile.  (The PPM code does work, as explained below.  The GIF
     code works too; it scales 8-bit GIF data to and from 12-bit depth
     automatically.)
  3. Compile.  Don't expect "make test" to pass, since the supplied test
     files are for 8-bit data.

Currently, 12-bit support does not work on 16-bit-int machines.

Note that a 12-bit version will not read 8-bit JPEG files, nor vice versa;
so you'll want to keep around a regular 8-bit compilation as well.
(Run-time selection of data depth, to allow a single copy that does both,
is possible but would probably slow things down considerably; it's very low
on our to-do list.)

The PPM reader (rdppm.c) can read 12-bit data from either text-format or
binary-format PPM and PGM files.  Binary-format PPM/PGM files which have a
maxval greater than 255 are assumed to use 2 bytes per sample, LSB first
(little-endian order).  As of early 1995, 2-byte binary format is not
officially supported by the PBMPLUS library, but it is expected that a
future release of PBMPLUS will support it.  Note that the PPM reader will
read files of any maxval regardless of the BITS_IN_JSAMPLE setting; incoming
data is automatically rescaled to either maxval=255 or maxval=4095 as
appropriate for the cjpeg bit depth.

The PPM writer (wrppm.c) will normally write 2-byte binary PPM or PGM
format, maxval 4095, when compiled with BITS_IN_JSAMPLE=12.  Since this
format is not yet widely supported, you can disable it by compiling wrppm.c
with PPM_NORAWWORD defined; then the data is scaled down to 8 bits to make a
standard 1-byte/sample PPM or PGM file.  (Yes, this means still another copy
of djpeg to keep around.  But hopefully you won't need it for very long.
Poskanzer's supposed to get that new PBMPLUS release out Real Soon Now.)

Of course, if you are working with 12-bit data, you probably have it stored
in some other, nonstandard format.  In that case you'll probably want to
write your own I/O modules to read and write your format.

Note that a 12-bit version of cjpeg always runs in "-optimize" mode, in
order to generate valid Huffman tables.  This is necessary because our
default Huffman tables only cover 8-bit data.

Removing code:

If you need to make a smaller version of the JPEG software, some optional
functions can be removed at compile time.  See the xxx_SUPPORTED #defines in
jconfig.h and jmorecfg.h.  If at all possible, we recommend that you leave in
decoder support for all valid JPEG files, to ensure that you can read anyone's
output.  Taking out support for image file formats that you don't use is the
most painless way to make the programs smaller.  Another possibility is to
remove some of the DCT methods: in particular, the "IFAST" method may not be
enough faster than the others to be worth keeping on your machine.  (If you
do remove ISLOW or IFAST, be sure to redefine JDCT_DEFAULT or JDCT_FASTEST
to a supported method, by adding a #define in jconfig.h.)


OPTIMIZATION
============

Unless you own a Cray, you'll probably be interested in making the JPEG
software go as fast as possible.  This section covers some machine-dependent
optimizations you may want to try.  We suggest that before trying any of
this, you first get the basic installation to pass the self-test step.
Repeat the self-test after any optimization to make sure that you haven't
broken anything.

The integer DCT routines perform a lot of multiplications.  These
multiplications must yield 32-bit results, but none of their input values
are more than 16 bits wide.  On many machines, notably the 680x0 and 80x86
CPUs, a 16x16=>32 bit multiply instruction is faster than a full 32x32=>32
bit multiply.  Unfortunately there is no portable way to specify such a
multiplication in C, but some compilers can generate one when you use the
right combination of casts.  See the MULTIPLYxxx macro definitions in
jdct.h.  If your compiler makes "int" be 32 bits and "short" be 16 bits,
defining SHORTxSHORT_32 is fairly likely to work.  When experimenting with
alternate definitions, be sure to test not only whether the code still works
(use the self-test), but also whether it is actually faster --- on some
compilers, alternate definitions may compute the right answer, yet be slower
than the default.  Timing cjpeg on a large PGM (grayscale) input file is the
best way to check this, as the DCT will be the largest fraction of the runtime
in that mode.  (Note: some of the distributed compiler-specific jconfig files
already contain #define switches to select appropriate MULTIPLYxxx
definitions.)

If your machine has sufficiently fast floating point hardware, you may find
that the float DCT method is faster than the integer DCT methods, even
after tweaking the integer multiply macros.  In that case you may want to
make the float DCT be the default method.  (The only objection to this is
that float DCT results may vary slightly across machines.)  To do that, add
"#define JDCT_DEFAULT JDCT_FLOAT" to jconfig.h.  Even if you don't change
the default, you should redefine JDCT_FASTEST, which is the method selected
by djpeg's -fast switch.  Don't forget to update the documentation files
(usage.doc and/or cjpeg.1, djpeg.1) to agree with what you've done.

If access to "short" arrays is slow on your machine, it may be a win to
define type JCOEF as int rather than short.  This will cost a good deal of
memory though, particularly in some multi-pass modes, so don't do it unless
you have memory to burn and short is REALLY slow.

If your compiler can compile function calls in-line, make sure the INLINE
macro in jmorecfg.h is defined as the keyword that marks a function
inline-able.  Some compilers have a switch that tells the compiler to inline
any function it thinks is profitable (e.g., -finline-functions for gcc).
Enabling such a switch is likely to make the compiled code bigger but faster.

In general, it's worth trying the maximum optimization level of your compiler,
and experimenting with any optional optimizations such as loop unrolling.
(Unfortunately, far too many compilers have optimizer bugs ... be prepared to
back off if the code fails self-test.)  If you do any experimentation along
these lines, please report the optimal settings to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net so
we can mention them in future releases.  Be sure to specify your machine and
compiler version.


HINTS FOR SPECIFIC SYSTEMS
==========================

We welcome reports on changes needed for systems not mentioned here.  Submit
'em to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  Also, if configure or ckconfig.c is wrong
about how to configure the JPEG software for your system, please let us know.


Acorn RISC OS:

(Thanks to Simon Middleton for these hints on compiling with Desktop C.)
After renaming the files according to Acorn conventions, take a copy of
makefile.ansi, change all occurrences of 'libjpeg.a' to 'libjpeg.o' and
change these definitions as indicated:

CFLAGS= -throwback -IC: -Wn
LDLIBS=C:o.Stubs
SYSDEPMEM=jmemansi.o
LN=Link
AR=LibFile -c -o

Also add a new line '.c.o:; $(cc) $< $(cflags) -c -o $@'.  Remove the
lines '$(RM) libjpeg.o' and '$(AR2) libjpeg.o' and the 'jconfig.h'
dependency section.

Copy jconfig.doc to jconfig.h.  Edit jconfig.h to define TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE
and CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED.

Run the makefile using !AMU not !Make.  If you want to use the 'clean' and
'test' makefile entries then you will have to fiddle with the syntax a bit
and rename the test files.


Amiga:

SAS C 6.50 reportedly is too buggy to compile the IJG code properly.
A patch to update to 6.51 is available from SAS or AmiNet FTP sites.

The supplied config files are set up to use jmemname.c as the memory
manager, with temporary files being created on the device named by
"JPEGTMP:".


Atari ST/STE/TT:
 
Copy the project files makcjpeg.st, makdjpeg.st, maktjpeg.st, and makljpeg.st
to cjpeg.prj, djpeg.prj, jpegtran.prj, and libjpeg.prj respectively.  The
project files should work as-is with Pure C.  For Turbo C, change library
filenames "pc..." to "tc..." in each project file.  Note that libjpeg.prj
selects jmemansi.c as the recommended memory manager.  You'll probably want to
adjust the DEFAULT_MAX_MEM setting --- you want it to be a couple hundred K
less than your normal free memory.  Put "#define DEFAULT_MAX_MEM nnnn" into
jconfig.h to do this.

To use the 68881/68882 coprocessor for the floating point DCT, add the
compiler option "-8" to the project files and replace pcfltlib.lib with
pc881lib.lib in cjpeg.prj and djpeg.prj.  Or if you don't have a
coprocessor, you may prefer to remove the float DCT code by undefining
DCT_FLOAT_SUPPORTED in jmorecfg.h (since without a coprocessor, the float
code will be too slow to be useful).  In that case, you can delete
pcfltlib.lib from the project files.

Note that you must make libjpeg.lib before making cjpeg.ttp, djpeg.ttp,
or jpegtran.ttp.  You'll have to perform the self-test by hand.

We haven't bothered to include project files for rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom.
Those source files should just be compiled by themselves; they don't
depend on the JPEG library.

There is a bug in some older versions of the Turbo C library which causes the
space used by temporary files created with "tmpfile()" not to be freed after
an abnormal program exit.  If you check your disk afterwards, you will find
cluster chains that are allocated but not used by a file.  This should not
happen in cjpeg/djpeg/jpegtran, since we enable a signal catcher to explicitly
close temp files before exiting.  But if you use the JPEG library with your
own code, be sure to supply a signal catcher, or else use a different
system-dependent memory manager.


Cray:

Should you be so fortunate as to be running JPEG on a Cray YMP, there is a
compiler bug in old versions of Cray's Standard C (prior to 3.1).  If you
still have an old compiler, you'll need to insert a line reading
"#pragma novector" just before the loop	
    for (i = 1; i <= (int) htbl->bits[l]; i++)
      huffsize[p++] = (char) l;
in fix_huff_tbl (in V5beta1, line 204 of jchuff.c and line 176 of jdhuff.c).
[This bug may or may not still occur with the current IJG code, but it's
probably a dead issue anyway...]


HP-UX:

If you have HP-UX 7.05 or later with the "software development" C compiler,
you should run the compiler in ANSI mode.  If using the configure script,
say
	./configure CC='cc -Aa'
(or -Ae if you prefer).  If configuring by hand, use makefile.ansi and add
"-Aa" to the CFLAGS line in the makefile.

If you have a pre-7.05 system, or if you are using the non-ANSI C compiler
delivered with a minimum HP-UX system, then you must use makefile.unix
(and do NOT add -Aa); or just run configure without the CC option.

On HP 9000 series 800 machines, the HP C compiler is buggy in revisions prior
to A.08.07.  If you get complaints about "not a typedef name", you'll have to
use makefile.unix, or run configure without the CC option.


Macintosh, generic comments:

The supplied user-interface files (cjpeg.c, djpeg.c, etc) are set up to
provide a Unix-style command line interface.  You can use this interface on
the Mac by means of the ccommand() library routine provided by Metrowerks
CodeWarrior or Think C.  This is only appropriate for testing the library,
however; to make a user-friendly equivalent of cjpeg/djpeg you'd really want
to develop a Mac-style user interface.  There isn't a complete example
available at the moment, but there are some helpful starting points:
1. Sam Bushell's free "To JPEG" applet provides drag-and-drop conversion to
JPEG under System 7 and later.  This only illustrates how to use the
compression half of the library, but it does a very nice job of that part.
The CodeWarrior source code is available from http://www.pobox.com/~jsam.
2. Jim Brunner prepared a Mac-style user interface for both compression and
decompression.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated since IJG v4, and
the library's API has changed considerably since then.  Still it may be of
some help, particularly as a guide to compiling the IJG code under Think C.
Jim's code is available from the Info-Mac archives, at sumex-aim.stanford.edu
or mirrors thereof; see file /info-mac/dev/src/jpeg-convert-c.hqx.

jmemmac.c is the recommended memory manager back end for Macintosh.  It uses
NewPtr/DisposePtr instead of malloc/free, and has a Mac-specific
implementation of jpeg_mem_available().  It also creates temporary files that
follow Mac conventions.  (That part of the code relies on System-7-or-later OS
functions.  See the comments in jmemmac.c if you need to run it on System 6.)
NOTE that USE_MAC_MEMMGR must be defined in jconfig.h to use jmemmac.c.

You can also use jmemnobs.c, if you don't care about handling images larger
than available memory.  If you use any memory manager back end other than
jmemmac.c, we recommend replacing "malloc" and "free" by "NewPtr" and
"DisposePtr", because Mac C libraries often have peculiar implementations of
malloc/free.  (For instance, free() may not return the freed space to the
Mac Memory Manager.  This is undesirable for the IJG code because jmemmgr.c
already clumps space requests.)


Macintosh, Metrowerks CodeWarrior:

The Unix-command-line-style interface can be used by defining USE_CCOMMAND.
You'll also need to define TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE to avoid stdin/stdout.
This means that when using the cjpeg/djpeg programs, you'll have to type the
input and output file names in the "Arguments" text-edit box, rather than
using the file radio buttons.  (Perhaps USE_FDOPEN or USE_SETMODE would
eliminate the problem, but I haven't heard from anyone who's tried it.)

On 680x0 Macs, Metrowerks defines type "double" as a 10-byte IEEE extended
float.  jmemmgr.c won't like this: it wants sizeof(ALIGN_TYPE) to be a power
of 2.  Add "#define ALIGN_TYPE long" to jconfig.h to eliminate the complaint.

The supplied configuration file jconfig.mac can be used for your jconfig.h;
it includes all the recommended symbol definitions.  If you have AppleScript
installed, you can run the supplied script makeproj.mac to create CodeWarrior
project files for the library and the testbed applications, then build the
library and applications.  (Thanks to Dan Sears and Don Agro for this nifty
hack, which saves us from trying to maintain CodeWarrior project files as part
of the IJG distribution...)


Macintosh, Think C:

The documentation in Jim Brunner's "JPEG Convert" source code (see above)
includes detailed build instructions for Think C; it's probably somewhat
out of date for the current release, but may be helpful.

If you want to build the minimal command line version, proceed as follows.
You'll have to prepare project files for the programs; we don't include any
in the distribution since they are not text files.  Use the file lists in
any of the supplied makefiles as a guide.  Also add the ANSI and Unix C
libraries in a separate segment.  You may need to divide the JPEG files into
more than one segment; we recommend dividing compression and decompression
modules.  Define USE_CCOMMAND in jconfig.h so that the ccommand() routine is
called.  You must also define TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE because stdin/stdout
don't handle binary data correctly.

On 680x0 Macs, Think C defines type "double" as a 12-byte IEEE extended float.
jmemmgr.c won't like this: it wants sizeof(ALIGN_TYPE) to be a power of 2.
Add "#define ALIGN_TYPE long" to jconfig.h to eliminate the complaint.

jconfig.mac should work as a jconfig.h configuration file for Think C,
but the makeproj.mac AppleScript script is specific to CodeWarrior.  Sorry.


MIPS R3000:

MIPS's cc version 1.31 has a rather nasty optimization bug.  Don't use -O
if you have that compiler version.  (Use "cc -V" to check the version.)
Note that the R3000 chip is found in workstations from DEC and others.


MS-DOS, generic comments for 16-bit compilers:

The IJG code is designed to work well in 80x86 "small" or "medium" memory
models (i.e., data pointers are 16 bits unless explicitly declared "far";
code pointers can be either size).  You may be able to use small model to
compile cjpeg or djpeg by itself, but you will probably have to use medium
model for any larger application.  This won't make much difference in
performance.  You *will* take a noticeable performance hit if you use a
large-data memory model, and you should avoid "huge" model if at all
possible.  Be sure that NEED_FAR_POINTERS is defined in jconfig.h if you use
a small-data memory model; be sure it is NOT defined if you use a large-data
model.  (The supplied makefiles and jconfig files for Borland and Microsoft C
compile in medium model and define NEED_FAR_POINTERS.)

The DOS-specific memory manager, jmemdos.c, should be used if possible.
It needs some assembly-code routines which are in jmemdosa.asm; make sure
your makefile assembles that file and includes it in the library.  If you
don't have a suitable assembler, you can get pre-assembled object files for
jmemdosa by FTP from ftp.uu.net:/graphics/jpeg/jdosaobj.zip.  (DOS-oriented
distributions of the IJG source code often include these object files.)

When using jmemdos.c, jconfig.h must define USE_MSDOS_MEMMGR and must set
MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK to less than 64K (65520L is a typical value).  If your
C library's far-heap malloc() can't allocate blocks that large, reduce
MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK to whatever it can handle.

If you can't use jmemdos.c for some reason --- for example, because you
don't have an assembler to assemble jmemdosa.asm --- you'll have to fall
back to jmemansi.c or jmemname.c.  You'll probably still need to set
MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK in jconfig.h, because most DOS C libraries won't malloc()
more than 64K at a time.  IMPORTANT: if you use jmemansi.c or jmemname.c,
you will have to compile in a large-data memory model in order to get the
right stdio library.  Too bad.

wrjpgcom needs to be compiled in large model, because it malloc()s a 64KB
work area to hold the comment text.  If your C library's malloc can't
handle that, reduce MAX_COM_LENGTH as necessary in wrjpgcom.c.

Most MS-DOS compilers treat stdin/stdout as text files, so you must use
two-file command line style.  But if your compiler has either fdopen() or
setmode(), you can use one-file style if you like.  To do this, define
USE_SETMODE or USE_FDOPEN so that stdin/stdout will be set to binary mode.
(USE_SETMODE seems to work with more DOS compilers than USE_FDOPEN.)  You
should test that I/O through stdin/stdout produces the same results as I/O
to explicitly named files... the "make test" procedures in the supplied
makefiles do NOT use stdin/stdout.


MS-DOS, generic comments for 32-bit compilers:

None of the above comments about memory models apply if you are using a
32-bit flat-memory-space environment, such as DJGPP or Watcom C.  (And you
should use one if you have it, as performance will be much better than
8086-compatible code!)  For flat-memory-space compilers, do NOT define
NEED_FAR_POINTERS, and do NOT use jmemdos.c.  Use jmemnobs.c if the
environment supplies adequate virtual memory, otherwise use jmemansi.c or
jmemname.c.

You'll still need to be careful about binary I/O through stdin/stdout.
See the last paragraph of the previous section.


MS-DOS, Borland C:

Be sure to convert all the source files to DOS text format (CR/LF newlines).
Although Borland C will often work OK with unmodified Unix (LF newlines)
source files, sometimes it will give bogus compile errors.
"Illegal character '#'" is the most common such error.  (This is true with
Borland C 3.1, but perhaps is fixed in newer releases.)

If you want one-file command line style, just undefine TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE.
jconfig.bcc already includes #define USE_SETMODE to make this work.
(fdopen does not work correctly.)


MS-DOS, Microsoft C:

makefile.mc6 works with Microsoft C, DOS Visual C++, etc.  It should only
be used if you want to build a 16-bit (small or medium memory model) program.

If you want one-file command line style, just undefine TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE.
jconfig.mc6 already includes #define USE_SETMODE to make this work.
(fdopen does not work correctly.)

Note that this makefile assumes that the working copy of itself is called
"makefile".  If you want to call it something else, say "makefile.mak",
be sure to adjust the dependency line that reads "$(RFILE) : makefile".
Otherwise the make will fail because it doesn't know how to create "makefile".
Worse, some releases of Microsoft's make utilities give an incorrect error
message in this situation.

Old versions of MS C fail with an "out of macro expansion space" error
because they can't cope with the macro TRACEMS8 (defined in jerror.h).
If this happens to you, the easiest solution is to change TRACEMS8 to
expand to nothing.  You'll lose the ability to dump out JPEG coefficient
tables with djpeg -debug -debug, but at least you can compile.

Original MS C 6.0 is very buggy; it compiles incorrect code unless you turn
off optimization entirely (remove -O from CFLAGS).  6.00A is better, but it
still generates bad code if you enable loop optimizations (-Ol or -Ox).

MS C 8.0 crashes when compiling jquant1.c with optimization switch /Oo ...
which is on by default.  To work around this bug, compile that one file
with /Oo-.


Microsoft Windows (all versions), generic comments:

Some Windows system include files define typedef boolean as "unsigned char".
The IJG code also defines typedef boolean, but we make it "int" by default.
This doesn't affect the IJG programs because we don't import those Windows
include files.  But if you use the JPEG library in your own program, and some
of your program's files import one definition of boolean while some import the
other, you can get all sorts of mysterious problems.  A good preventive step
is to make the IJG library use "unsigned char" for boolean.  To do that,
add something like this to your jconfig.h file:
	/* Define "boolean" as unsigned char, not int, per Windows custom */
	#ifndef __RPCNDR_H__	/* don't conflict if rpcndr.h already read */
	typedef unsigned char boolean;
	#endif
	#define HAVE_BOOLEAN	/* prevent jmorecfg.h from redefining it */
(This is already in jconfig.vc, by the way.)

windef.h contains the declarations
	#define far
	#define FAR far
Since jmorecfg.h tries to define FAR as empty, you may get a compiler
warning if you include both jpeglib.h and windef.h (which windows.h
includes).  To suppress the warning, you can put "#ifndef FAR"/"#endif"
around the line "#define FAR" in jmorecfg.h.

When using the library in a Windows application, you will almost certainly
want to modify or replace the error handler module jerror.c, since our
default error handler does a couple of inappropriate things:
  1. it tries to write error and warning messages on stderr;
  2. in event of a fatal error, it exits by calling exit().

A simple stopgap solution for problem 1 is to replace the line
	fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", buffer);
(in output_message in jerror.c) with
	MessageBox(GetActiveWindow(),buffer,"JPEG Error",MB_OK|MB_ICONERROR);
It's highly recommended that you at least do that much, since otherwise
error messages will disappear into nowhere.  (Beginning with IJG v6b, this
code is already present in jerror.c; just define USE_WINDOWS_MESSAGEBOX in
jconfig.h to enable it.)

The proper solution for problem 2 is to return control to your calling
application after a library error.  This can be done with the setjmp/longjmp
technique discussed in libjpeg.doc and illustrated in example.c.  (NOTE:
some older Windows C compilers provide versions of setjmp/longjmp that
don't actually work under Windows.  You may need to use the Windows system
functions Catch and Throw instead.)

The recommended memory manager under Windows is jmemnobs.c; in other words,
let Windows do any virtual memory management needed.  You should NOT use
jmemdos.c nor jmemdosa.asm under Windows.

For Windows 3.1, we recommend compiling in medium or large memory model;
for newer Windows versions, use a 32-bit flat memory model.  (See the MS-DOS
sections above for more info about memory models.)  In the 16-bit memory
models only, you'll need to put
	#define MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK 65520L	/* Maximum request to malloc() */
into jconfig.h to limit allocation chunks to 64Kb.  (Without that, you'd
have to use huge memory model, which slows things down unnecessarily.)
jmemnobs.c works without modification in large or flat memory models, but to
use medium model, you need to modify its jpeg_get_large and jpeg_free_large
routines to allocate far memory.  In any case, you might like to replace
its calls to malloc and free with direct calls on Windows memory allocation
functions.

You may also want to modify jdatasrc.c and jdatadst.c to use Windows file
operations rather than fread/fwrite.  This is only necessary if your C
compiler doesn't provide a competent implementation of C stdio functions.

You might want to tweak the RGB_xxx macros in jmorecfg.h so that the library
will accept or deliver color pixels in BGR sample order, not RGB; BGR order
is usually more convenient under Windows.  Note that this change will break
the sample applications cjpeg/djpeg, but the library itself works fine.


Many people want to convert the IJG library into a DLL.  This is reasonably
straightforward, but watch out for the following:

  1. Don't try to compile as a DLL in small or medium memory model; use
large model, or even better, 32-bit flat model.  Many places in the IJG code
assume the address of a local variable is an ordinary (not FAR) pointer;
that isn't true in a medium-model DLL.

  2. Microsoft C cannot pass file pointers between applications and DLLs.
(See Microsoft Knowledge Base, PSS ID Number Q50336.)  So jdatasrc.c and
jdatadst.c don't work if you open a file in your application and then pass
the pointer to the DLL.  One workaround is to make jdatasrc.c/jdatadst.c
part of your main application rather than part of the DLL.

  3. You'll probably need to modify the macros GLOBAL() and EXTERN() to
attach suitable linkage keywords to the exported routine names.  Similarly,
you'll want to modify METHODDEF() and JMETHOD() to ensure function pointers
are declared in a way that lets application routines be called back through
the function pointers.  These macros are in jmorecfg.h.  Typical definitions
for a 16-bit DLL are:
	#define GLOBAL(type)		type _far _pascal _loadds _export
	#define EXTERN(type)		extern type _far _pascal _loadds
	#define METHODDEF(type)		static type _far _pascal
	#define JMETHOD(type,methodname,arglist)  \
		type (_far _pascal *methodname) arglist
For a 32-bit DLL you may want something like
	#define GLOBAL(type)		__declspec(dllexport) type
	#define EXTERN(type)		extern __declspec(dllexport) type
Although not all the GLOBAL routines are actually intended to be called by
the application, the performance cost of making them all DLL entry points is
negligible.

The unmodified IJG library presents a very C-specific application interface,
so the resulting DLL is only usable from C or C++ applications.  There has
been some talk of writing wrapper code that would present a simpler interface
usable from other languages, such as Visual Basic.  This is on our to-do list
but hasn't been very high priority --- any volunteers out there?


Microsoft Windows, Borland C:

The provided jconfig.bcc should work OK in a 32-bit Windows environment,
but you'll need to tweak it in a 16-bit environment (you'd need to define
NEED_FAR_POINTERS and MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK).  Beware that makefile.bcc will need
alteration if you want to use it for Windows --- in particular, you should
use jmemnobs.c not jmemdos.c under Windows.

Borland C++ 4.5 fails with an internal compiler error when trying to compile
jdmerge.c in 32-bit mode.  If enough people complain, perhaps Borland will fix
it.  In the meantime, the simplest known workaround is to add a redundant
definition of the variable range_limit in h2v1_merged_upsample(), at the head
of the block that handles odd image width (about line 268 in v6 jdmerge.c):
  /* If image width is odd, do the last output column separately */
  if (cinfo->output_width & 1) {
    register JSAMPLE * range_limit = cinfo->sample_range_limit; /* ADD THIS */
    cb = GETJSAMPLE(*inptr1);
Pretty bizarre, especially since the very similar routine h2v2_merged_upsample
doesn't trigger the bug.
Recent reports suggest that this bug does not occur with "bcc32a" (the
Pentium-optimized version of the compiler).

Another report from a user of Borland C 4.5 was that incorrect code (leading
to a color shift in processed images) was produced if any of the following
optimization switch combinations were used: 
	-Ot -Og
	-Ot -Op
	-Ot -Om
So try backing off on optimization if you see such a problem.  (Are there
several different releases all numbered "4.5"??)


Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Visual C++:

jconfig.vc should work OK with any Microsoft compiler for a 32-bit memory
model.  makefile.vc is intended for command-line use.  (If you are using
the Developer Studio environment, you may prefer the DevStudio project
files; see below.)

Some users feel that it's easier to call the library from C++ code if you
force VC++ to treat the library as C++ code, which you can do by renaming
all the *.c files to *.cpp (and adjusting the makefile to match).  This
avoids the need to put extern "C" { ... } around #include "jpeglib.h" in
your C++ application.


Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Developer Studio:

We include makefiles that should work as project files in DevStudio 4.2 or
later.  There is a library makefile that builds the IJG library as a static
Win32 library, and an application makefile that builds the sample applications
as Win32 console applications.  (Even if you only want the library, we
recommend building the applications so that you can run the self-test.)

To use:
1. Copy jconfig.vc to jconfig.h, makelib.ds to jpeg.mak, and
   makeapps.ds to apps.mak.  (Note that the renaming is critical!)
2. Click on the .mak files to construct project workspaces.
   (If you are using DevStudio more recent than 4.2, you'll probably
   get a message saying that the makefiles are being updated.)
3. Build the library project, then the applications project.
4. Move the application .exe files from `app`\Release to an
   appropriate location on your path.
5. To perform the self-test, execute the command line
	NMAKE /f makefile.vc  test


OS/2, Borland C++:

Watch out for optimization bugs in older Borland compilers; you may need
to back off the optimization switch settings.  See the comments in
makefile.bcc.


SGI:

On some SGI systems, you may need to set "AR2= ar -ts" in the Makefile.
If you are using configure, you can do this by saying
	./configure RANLIB='ar -ts'
This change is not needed on all SGIs.  Use it only if the make fails at the
stage of linking the completed programs.

On the MIPS R4000 architecture (Indy, etc.), the compiler option "-mips2"
reportedly speeds up the float DCT method substantially, enough to make it
faster than the default int method (but still slower than the fast int
method).  If you use -mips2, you may want to alter the default DCT method to
be float.  To do this, put "#define JDCT_DEFAULT JDCT_FLOAT" in jconfig.h.


VMS:

On an Alpha/VMS system with MMS, be sure to use the "/Marco=Alpha=1"
qualifier with MMS when building the JPEG package.

VAX/VMS v5.5-1 may have problems with the test step of the build procedure
reporting differences when it compares the original and test images.  If the
error points to the last block of the files, it is most likely bogus and may
be safely ignored.  It seems to be because the files are Stream_LF and
Backup/Compare has difficulty with the (presumably) null padded files.
This problem was not observed on VAX/VMS v6.1 or AXP/VMS v6.1.

This file describes how to use the IJG JPEG library within an application
program.  Read it if you want to write a program that uses the library.

The file example.c provides heavily commented skeleton code for calling the
JPEG library.  Also see jpeglib.h (the include file to be used by application
programs) for full details about data structures and function parameter lists.
The library source code, of course, is the ultimate reference.

Note that there have been *major* changes from the application interface
presented by IJG version 4 and earlier versions.  The old design had several
inherent limitations, and it had accumulated a lot of cruft as we added
features while trying to minimize application-interface changes.  We have
sacrificed backward compatibility in the version 5 rewrite, but we think the
improvements justify this.

OVERVIEW
========

Functions provided by the library
---------------------------------

The IJG JPEG library provides C code to read and write JPEG-compressed image
files.  The surrounding application program receives or supplies image data a
scanline at a time, using a straightforward uncompressed image format.  All
details of color conversion and other preprocessing/postprocessing can be
handled by the library.

The library includes a substantial amount of code that is not covered by the
JPEG standard but is necessary for typical applications of JPEG.  These
functions preprocess the image before JPEG compression or postprocess it after
decompression.  They include colorspace conversion, downsampling/upsampling,
and color quantization.  The application indirectly selects use of this code
by specifying the format in which it wishes to supply or receive image data.
For example, if colormapped output is requested, then the decompression
library automatically invokes color quantization.

A wide range of quality vs. speed tradeoffs are possible in JPEG processing,
and even more so in decompression postprocessing.  The decompression library
provides multiple implementations that cover most of the useful tradeoffs,
ranging from very-high-quality down to fast-preview operation.  On the
compression side we have generally not provided low-quality choices, since
compression is normally less time-critical.  It should be understood that the
low-quality modes may not meet the JPEG standard's accuracy requirements;
nonetheless, they are useful for viewers.

A word about functions *not* provided by the library.  We handle a subset of
the ISO JPEG standard; most baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
JPEG processes are supported.  (Our subset includes all features now in common
use.)  Unsupported ISO options include:
	* Hierarchical storage
	* Lossless JPEG
	* Arithmetic entropy coding (unsupported for legal reasons)
	* DNL marker
	* Nonintegral subsampling ratios
We support both 8- and 12-bit data precision, but this is a compile-time
choice rather than a run-time choice; hence it is difficult to use both
precisions in a single application.

By itself, the library handles only interchange JPEG datastreams --- in
particular the widely used JFIF file format.  The library can be used by
surrounding code to process interchange or abbreviated JPEG datastreams that
are embedded in more complex file formats.  (For example, this library is
used by the free LIBTIFF library to support JPEG compression in TIFF.)


Outline of typical usage
------------------------

The rough outline of a JPEG compression operation is:

	Allocate and initialize a JPEG compression object
	Specify the destination for the compressed data (eg, a file)
	Set parameters for compression, including image size & colorspace
	jpeg_start_compress(...);
	while (scan lines remain to be written)
		jpeg_write_scanlines(...);
	jpeg_finish_compress(...);
	Release the JPEG compression object

A JPEG compression object holds parameters and working state for the JPEG
library.  We make creation/destruction of the object separate from starting
or finishing compression of an image; the same object can be re-used for a
series of image compression operations.  This makes it easy to re-use the
same parameter settings for a sequence of images.  Re-use of a JPEG object
also has important implications for processing abbreviated JPEG datastreams,
as discussed later.

The image data to be compressed is supplied to jpeg_write_scanlines() from
in-memory buffers.  If the application is doing file-to-file compression,
reading image data from the source file is the application's responsibility.
The library emits compressed data by calling a "data destination manager",
which typically will write the data into a file; but the application can
provide its own destination manager to do something else.

Similarly, the rough outline of a JPEG decompression operation is:

	Allocate and initialize a JPEG decompression object
	Specify the source of the compressed data (eg, a file)
	Call jpeg_read_header() to obtain image info
	Set parameters for decompression
	jpeg_start_decompress(...);
	while (scan lines remain to be read)
		jpeg_read_scanlines(...);
	jpeg_finish_decompress(...);
	Release the JPEG decompression object

This is comparable to the compression outline except that reading the
datastream header is a separate step.  This is helpful because information
about the image's size, colorspace, etc is available when the application
selects decompression parameters.  For example, the application can choose an
output scaling ratio that will fit the image into the available screen size.

The decompression library obtains compressed data by calling a data source
manager, which typically will read the data from a file; but other behaviors
can be obtained with a custom source manager.  Decompressed data is delivered
into in-memory buffers passed to jpeg_read_scanlines().

It is possible to abort an incomplete compression or decompression operation
by calling jpeg_abort(); or, if you do not need to retain the JPEG object,
simply release it by calling jpeg_destroy().

JPEG compression and decompression objects are two separate struct types.
However, they share some common fields, and certain routines such as
jpeg_destroy() can work on either type of object.

The JPEG library has no static variables: all state is in the compression
or decompression object.  Therefore it is possible to process multiple
compression and decompression operations concurrently, using multiple JPEG
objects.

Both compression and decompression can be done in an incremental memory-to-
memory fashion, if suitable source/destination managers are used.  See the
section on "I/O suspension" for more details.


BASIC LIBRARY USAGE
===================

Data formats
------------

Before diving into procedural details, it is helpful to understand the
image data format that the JPEG library expects or returns.

The standard input image format is a rectangular array of pixels, with each
pixel having the same number of "component" or "sample" values (color
channels).  You must specify how many components there are and the colorspace
interpretation of the components.  Most applications will use RGB data
(three components per pixel) or grayscale data (one component per pixel).
PLEASE NOTE THAT RGB DATA IS THREE SAMPLES PER PIXEL, GRAYSCALE ONLY ONE.
A remarkable number of people manage to miss this, only to find that their
programs don't work with grayscale JPEG files.

There is no provision for colormapped input.  JPEG files are always full-color
or full grayscale (or sometimes another colorspace such as CMYK).  You can
feed in a colormapped image by expanding it to full-color format.  However
JPEG often doesn't work very well with source data that has been colormapped,
because of dithering noise.  This is discussed in more detail in the JPEG FAQ
and the other references mentioned in the README file.

Pixels are stored by scanlines, with each scanline running from left to
right.  The component values for each pixel are adjacent in the row; for
example, R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B,... for 24-bit RGB color.  Each scanline is an
array of data type JSAMPLE --- which is typically "unsigned char", unless
you've changed jmorecfg.h.  (You can also change the RGB pixel layout, say
to B,G,R order, by modifying jmorecfg.h.  But see the restrictions listed in
that file before doing so.)

A 2-D array of pixels is formed by making a list of pointers to the starts of
scanlines; so the scanlines need not be physically adjacent in memory.  Even
if you process just one scanline at a time, you must make a one-element
pointer array to conform to this structure.  Pointers to JSAMPLE rows are of
type JSAMPROW, and the pointer to the pointer array is of type JSAMPARRAY.

The library accepts or supplies one or more complete scanlines per call.
It is not possible to process part of a row at a time.  Scanlines are always
processed top-to-bottom.  You can process an entire image in one call if you
have it all in memory, but usually it's simplest to process one scanline at
a time.

For best results, source data values should have the precision specified by
BITS_IN_JSAMPLE (normally 8 bits).  For instance, if you choose to compress
data that's only 6 bits/channel, you should left-justify each value in a
byte before passing it to the compressor.  If you need to compress data
that has more than 8 bits/channel, compile with BITS_IN_JSAMPLE = 12.
(See "Library compile-time options", later.)


The data format returned by the decompressor is the same in all details,
except that colormapped output is supported.  (Again, a JPEG file is never
colormapped.  But you can ask the decompressor to perform on-the-fly color
quantization to deliver colormapped output.)  If you request colormapped
output then the returned data array contains a single JSAMPLE per pixel;
its value is an index into a color map.  The color map is represented as
a 2-D JSAMPARRAY in which each row holds the values of one color component,
that is, colormap[i][j] is the value of the i'th color component for pixel
value (map index) j.  Note that since the colormap indexes are stored in
JSAMPLEs, the maximum number of colors is limited by the size of JSAMPLE
(ie, at most 256 colors for an 8-bit JPEG library).


Compression details
-------------------

Here we revisit the JPEG compression outline given in the overview.

1. Allocate and initialize a JPEG compression object.

A JPEG compression object is a "struct jpeg_compress_struct".  (It also has
a bunch of subsidiary structures which are allocated via malloc(), but the
application doesn't control those directly.)  This struct can be just a local
variable in the calling routine, if a single routine is going to execute the
whole JPEG compression sequence.  Otherwise it can be static or allocated
from malloc().

You will also need a structure representing a JPEG error handler.  The part
of this that the library cares about is a "struct jpeg_error_mgr".  If you
are providing your own error handler, you'll typically want to embed the
jpeg_error_mgr struct in a larger structure; this is discussed later under
"Error handling".  For now we'll assume you are just using the default error
handler.  The default error handler will print JPEG error/warning messages
on stderr, and it will call exit() if a fatal error occurs.

You must initialize the error handler structure, store a pointer to it into
the JPEG object's "err" field, and then call jpeg_create_compress() to
initialize the rest of the JPEG object.

Typical code for this step, if you are using the default error handler, is

	struct jpeg_compress_struct cinfo;
	struct jpeg_error_mgr jerr;
	...
	cinfo.err = jpeg_std_error(&jerr);
	jpeg_create_compress(&cinfo);

jpeg_create_compress allocates a small amount of memory, so it could fail
if you are out of memory.  In that case it will exit via the error handler;
that's why the error handler must be initialized first.


2. Specify the destination for the compressed data (eg, a file).

As previously mentioned, the JPEG library delivers compressed data to a
"data destination" module.  The library includes one data destination
module which knows how to write to a stdio stream.  You can use your own
destination module if you want to do something else, as discussed later.

If you use the standard destination module, you must open the target stdio
stream beforehand.  Typical code for this step looks like:

	FILE * outfile;
	...
	if ((outfile = fopen(filename, "wb")) == NULL) {
	    fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s\n", filename);
	    exit(1);
	}
	jpeg_stdio_dest(&cinfo, outfile);

where the last line invokes the standard destination module.

WARNING: it is critical that the binary compressed data be delivered to the
output file unchanged.  On non-Unix systems the stdio library may perform
newline translation or otherwise corrupt binary data.  To suppress this
behavior, you may need to use a "b" option to fopen (as shown above), or use
setmode() or another routine to put the stdio stream in binary mode.  See
cjpeg.c and djpeg.c for code that has been found to work on many systems.

You can select the data destination after setting other parameters (step 3),
if that's more convenient.  You may not change the destination between
calling jpeg_start_compress() and jpeg_finish_compress().


3. Set parameters for compression, including image size & colorspace.

You must supply information about the source image by setting the following
fields in the JPEG object (cinfo structure):

	image_width		Width of image, in pixels
	image_height		Height of image, in pixels
	input_components	Number of color channels (samples per pixel)
	in_color_space		Color space of source image

The image dimensions are, hopefully, obvious.  JPEG supports image dimensions
of 1 to 64K pixels in either direction.  The input color space is typically
RGB or grayscale, and input_components is 3 or 1 accordingly.  (See "Special
color spaces", later, for more info.)  The in_color_space field must be
assigned one of the J_COLOR_SPACE enum constants, typically JCS_RGB or
JCS_GRAYSCALE.

JPEG has a large number of compression parameters that determine how the
image is encoded.  Most applications don't need or want to know about all
these parameters.  You can set all the parameters to reasonable defaults by
calling jpeg_set_defaults(); then, if there are particular values you want
to change, you can do so after that.  The "Compression parameter selection"
section tells about all the parameters.

You must set in_color_space correctly before calling jpeg_set_defaults(),
because the defaults depend on the source image colorspace.  However the
other three source image parameters need not be valid until you call
jpeg_start_compress().  There's no harm in calling jpeg_set_defaults() more
than once, if that happens to be convenient.

Typical code for a 24-bit RGB source image is

	cinfo.image_width = Width; 	/* image width and height, in pixels */
	cinfo.image_height = Height;
	cinfo.input_components = 3;	/* # of color components per pixel */
	cinfo.in_color_space = JCS_RGB; /* colorspace of input image */

	jpeg_set_defaults(&cinfo);
	/* Make optional parameter settings here */


4. jpeg_start_compress(...);

After you have established the data destination and set all the necessary
source image info and other parameters, call jpeg_start_compress() to begin
a compression cycle.  This will initialize internal state, allocate working
storage, and emit the first few bytes of the JPEG datastream header.

Typical code:

	jpeg_start_compress(&cinfo, TRUE);

The "TRUE" parameter ensures that a complete JPEG interchange datastream
will be written.  This is appropriate in most cases.  If you think you might
want to use an abbreviated datastream, read the section on abbreviated
datastreams, below.

Once you have called jpeg_start_compress(), you may not alter any JPEG
parameters or other fields of the JPEG object until you have completed
the compression cycle.


5. while (scan lines remain to be written)
	jpeg_write_scanlines(...);

Now write all the required image data by calling jpeg_write_scanlines()
one or more times.  You can pass one or more scanlines in each call, up
to the total image height.  In most applications it is convenient to pass
just one or a few scanlines at a time.  The expected format for the passed
data is discussed under "Data formats", above.

Image data should be written in top-to-bottom scanline order.  The JPEG spec
contains some weasel wording about how top and bottom are application-defined
terms (a curious interpretation of the English language...) but if you want
your files to be compatible with everyone else's, you WILL use top-to-bottom
order.  If the source data must be read in bottom-to-top order, you can use
the JPEG library's virtual array mechanism to invert the data efficiently.
Examples of this can be found in the sample application cjpeg.

The library maintains a count of the number of scanlines written so far
in the next_scanline field of the JPEG object.  Usually you can just use
this variable as the loop counter, so that the loop test looks like
"while (cinfo.next_scanline < cinfo.image_height)".

Code for this step depends heavily on the way that you store the source data.
example.c shows the following code for the case of a full-size 2-D source
array containing 3-byte RGB pixels:

	JSAMPROW row_pointer[1];	/* pointer to a single row */
	int row_stride;			/* physical row width in buffer */

	row_stride = image_width * 3;	/* JSAMPLEs per row in image_buffer */

	while (cinfo.next_scanline < cinfo.image_height) {
	    row_pointer[0] = & image_buffer[cinfo.next_scanline * row_stride];
	    jpeg_write_scanlines(&cinfo, row_pointer, 1);
	}

jpeg_write_scanlines() returns the number of scanlines actually written.
This will normally be equal to the number passed in, so you can usually
ignore the return value.  It is different in just two cases:
  * If you try to write more scanlines than the declared image height,
    the additional scanlines are ignored.
  * If you use a suspending data destination manager, output buffer overrun
    will cause the compressor to return before accepting all the passed lines.
    This feature is discussed under "I/O suspension", below.  The normal
    stdio destination manager will NOT cause this to happen.
In any case, the return value is the same as the change in the value of
next_scanline.


6. jpeg_finish_compress(...);

After all the image data has been written, call jpeg_finish_compress() to
complete the compression cycle.  This step is ESSENTIAL to ensure that the
last bufferload of data is written to the data destination.
jpeg_finish_compress() also releases working memory associated with the JPEG
object.

Typical code:

	jpeg_finish_compress(&cinfo);

If using the stdio destination manager, don't forget to close the output
stdio stream (if necessary) afterwards.

If you have requested a multi-pass operating mode, such as Huffman code
optimization, jpeg_finish_compress() will perform the additional passes using
data buffered by the first pass.  In this case jpeg_finish_compress() may take
quite a while to complete.  With the default compression parameters, this will
not happen.

It is an error to call jpeg_finish_compress() before writing the necessary
total number of scanlines.  If you wish to abort compression, call
jpeg_abort() as discussed below.

After completing a compression cycle, you may dispose of the JPEG object
as discussed next, or you may use it to compress another image.  In that case
return to step 2, 3, or 4 as appropriate.  If you do not change the
destination manager, the new datastream will be written to the same target.
If you do not change any JPEG parameters, the new datastream will be written
with the same parameters as before.  Note that you can change the input image
dimensions freely between cycles, but if you change the input colorspace, you
should call jpeg_set_defaults() to adjust for the new colorspace; and then
you'll need to repeat all of step 3.


7. Release the JPEG compression object.

When you are done with a JPEG compression object, destroy it by calling
jpeg_destroy_compress().  This will free all subsidiary memory (regardless of
the previous state of the object).  Or you can call jpeg_destroy(), which
works for either compression or decompression objects --- this may be more
convenient if you are sharing code between compression and decompression
cases.  (Actually, these routines are equivalent except for the declared type
of the passed pointer.  To avoid gripes from ANSI C compilers, jpeg_destroy()
should be passed a j_common_ptr.)

If you allocated the jpeg_compress_struct structure from malloc(), freeing
it is your responsibility --- jpeg_destroy() won't.  Ditto for the error
handler structure.

Typical code:

	jpeg_destroy_compress(&cinfo);


8. Aborting.

If you decide to abort a compression cycle before finishing, you can clean up
in either of two ways:

* If you don't need the JPEG object any more, just call
  jpeg_destroy_compress() or jpeg_destroy() to release memory.  This is
  legitimate at any point after calling jpeg_create_compress() --- in fact,
  it's safe even if jpeg_create_compress() fails.

* If you want to re-use the JPEG object, call jpeg_abort_compress(), or call
  jpeg_abort() which works on both compression and decompression objects.
  This will return the object to an idle state, releasing any working memory.
  jpeg_abort() is allowed at any time after successful object creation.

Note that cleaning up the data destination, if required, is your
responsibility; neither of these routines will call term_destination().
(See "Compressed data handling", below, for more about that.)

jpeg_destroy() and jpeg_abort() are the only safe calls to make on a JPEG
object that has reported an error by calling error_exit (see "Error handling"
for more info).  The internal state of such an object is likely to be out of
whack.  Either of these two routines will return the object to a known state.


Decompression details
---------------------

Here we revisit the JPEG decompression outline given in the overview.

1. Allocate and initialize a JPEG decompression object.

This is just like initialization for compression, as discussed above,
except that the object is a "struct jpeg_decompress_struct" and you
call jpeg_create_decompress().  Error handling is exactly the same.

Typical code:

	struct jpeg_decompress_struct cinfo;
	struct jpeg_error_mgr jerr;
	...
	cinfo.err = jpeg_std_error(&jerr);
	jpeg_create_decompress(&cinfo);

(Both here and in the IJG code, we usually use variable name "cinfo" for
both compression and decompression objects.)


2. Specify the source of the compressed data (eg, a file).

As previously mentioned, the JPEG library reads compressed data from a "data
source" module.  The library includes one data source module which knows how
to read from a stdio stream.  You can use your own source module if you want
to do something else, as discussed later.

If you use the standard source module, you must open the source stdio stream
beforehand.  Typical code for this step looks like:

	FILE * infile;
	...
	if ((infile = fopen(filename, "rb")) == NULL) {
	    fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s\n", filename);
	    exit(1);
	}
	jpeg_stdio_src(&cinfo, infile);

where the last line invokes the standard source module.

WARNING: it is critical that the binary compressed data be read unchanged.
On non-Unix systems the stdio library may perform newline translation or
otherwise corrupt binary data.  To suppress this behavior, you may need to use
a "b" option to fopen (as shown above), or use setmode() or another routine to
put the stdio stream in binary mode.  See cjpeg.c and djpeg.c for code that
has been found to work on many systems.

You may not change the data source between calling jpeg_read_header() and
jpeg_finish_decompress().  If you wish to read a series of JPEG images from
a single source file, you should repeat the jpeg_read_header() to
jpeg_finish_decompress() sequence without reinitializing either the JPEG
object or the data source module; this prevents buffered input data from
being discarded.


3. Call jpeg_read_header() to obtain image info.

Typical code for this step is just

	jpeg_read_header(&cinfo, TRUE);

This will read the source datastream header markers, up to the beginning
of the compressed data proper.  On return, the image dimensions and other
info have been stored in the JPEG object.  The application may wish to
consult this information before selecting decompression parameters.

More complex code is necessary if
  * A suspending data source is used --- in that case jpeg_read_header()
    may return before it has read all the header data.  See "I/O suspension",
    below.  The normal stdio source manager will NOT cause this to happen.
  * Abbreviated JPEG files are to be processed --- see the section on
    abbreviated datastreams.  Standard applications that deal only in
    interchange JPEG files need not be concerned with this case either.

It is permissible to stop at this point if you just wanted to find out the
image dimensions and other header info for a JPEG file.  In that case,
call jpeg_destroy() when you are done with the JPEG object, or call
jpeg_abort() to return it to an idle state before selecting a new data
source and reading another header.


4. Set parameters for decompression.

jpeg_read_header() sets appropriate default decompression parameters based on
the properties of the image (in particular, its colorspace).  However, you
may well want to alter these defaults before beginning the decompression.
For example, the default is to produce full color output from a color file.
If you want colormapped output you must ask for it.  Other options allow the
returned image to be scaled and allow various speed/quality tradeoffs to be
selected.  "Decompression parameter selection", below, gives details.

If the defaults are appropriate, nothing need be done at this step.

Note that all default values are set by each call to jpeg_read_header().
If you reuse a decompression object, you cannot expect your parameter
settings to be preserved across cycles, as you can for compression.
You must set desired parameter values each time.


5. jpeg_start_decompress(...);

Once the parameter values are satisfactory, call jpeg_start_decompress() to
begin decompression.  This will initialize internal state, allocate working
memory, and prepare for returning data.

Typical code is just

	jpeg_start_decompress(&cinfo);

If you have requested a multi-pass operating mode, such as 2-pass color
quantization, jpeg_start_decompress() will do everything needed before data
output can begin.  In this case jpeg_start_decompress() may take quite a while
to complete.  With a single-scan (non progressive) JPEG file and default
decompression parameters, this will not happen; jpeg_start_decompress() will
return quickly.

After this call, the final output image dimensions, including any requested
scaling, are available in the JPEG object; so is the selected colormap, if
colormapped output has been requested.  Useful fields include

	output_width		image width and height, as scaled
	output_height
	out_color_components	# of color components in out_color_space
	output_components	# of color components returned per pixel
	colormap		the selected colormap, if any
	actual_number_of_colors		number of entries in colormap

output_components is 1 (a colormap index) when quantizing colors; otherwise it
equals out_color_components.  It is the number of JSAMPLE values that will be
emitted per pixel in the output arrays.

Typically you will need to allocate data buffers to hold the incoming image.
You will need output_width * output_components JSAMPLEs per scanline in your
output buffer, and a total of output_height scanlines will be returned.

Note: if you are using the JPEG library's internal memory manager to allocate
data buffers (as djpeg does), then the manager's protocol requires that you
request large buffers *before* calling jpeg_start_decompress().  This is a
little tricky since the output_XXX fields are not normally valid then.  You
can make them valid by calling jpeg_calc_output_dimensions() after setting the
relevant parameters (scaling, output color space, and quantization flag).


6. while (scan lines remain to be read)
	jpeg_read_scanlines(...);

Now you can read the decompressed image data by calling jpeg_read_scanlines()
one or more times.  At each call, you pass in the maximum number of scanlines
to be read (ie, the height of your working buffer); jpeg_read_scanlines()
will return up to that many lines.  The return value is the number of lines
actually read.  The format of the returned data is discussed under "Data
formats", above.  Don't forget that grayscale and color JPEGs will return
different data formats!

Image data is returned in top-to-bottom scanline order.  If you must write
out the image in bottom-to-top order, you can use the JPEG library's virtual
array mechanism to invert the data efficiently.  Examples of this can be
found in the sample application djpeg.

The library maintains a count of the number of scanlines returned so far
in the output_scanline field of the JPEG object.  Usually you can just use
this variable as the loop counter, so that the loop test looks like
"while (cinfo.output_scanline < cinfo.output_height)".  (Note that the test
should NOT be against image_height, unless you never use scaling.  The
image_height field is the height of the original unscaled image.)
The return value always equals the change in the value of output_scanline.

If you don't use a suspending data source, it is safe to assume that
jpeg_read_scanlines() reads at least one scanline per call, until the
bottom of the image has been reached.

If you use a buffer larger than one scanline, it is NOT safe to assume that
jpeg_read_scanlines() fills it.  (The current implementation returns only a
few scanlines per call, no matter how large a buffer you pass.)  So you must
always provide a loop that calls jpeg_read_scanlines() repeatedly until the
whole image has been read.


7. jpeg_finish_decompress(...);

After all the image data has been read, call jpeg_finish_decompress() to
complete the decompression cycle.  This causes working memory associated
with the JPEG object to be released.

Typical code:

	jpeg_finish_decompress(&cinfo);

If using the stdio source manager, don't forget to close the source stdio
stream if necessary.

It is an error to call jpeg_finish_decompress() before reading the correct
total number of scanlines.  If you wish to abort decompression, call
jpeg_abort() as discussed below.

After completing a decompression cycle, you may dispose of the JPEG object as
discussed next, or you may use it to decompress another image.  In that case
return to step 2 or 3 as appropriate.  If you do not change the source
manager, the next image will be read from the same source.


8. Release the JPEG decompression object.

When you are done with a JPEG decompression object, destroy it by calling
jpeg_destroy_decompress() or jpeg_destroy().  The previous discussion of
destroying compression objects applies here too.

Typical code:

	jpeg_destroy_decompress(&cinfo);


9. Aborting.

You can abort a decompression cycle by calling jpeg_destroy_decompress() or
jpeg_destroy() if you don't need the JPEG object any more, or
jpeg_abort_decompress() or jpeg_abort() if you want to reuse the object.
The previous discussion of aborting compression cycles applies here too.


Mechanics of usage: include files, linking, etc
-----------------------------------------------

Applications using the JPEG library should include the header file jpeglib.h
to obtain declarations of data types and routines.  Before including
jpeglib.h, include system headers that define at least the typedefs FILE and
size_t.  On ANSI-conforming systems, including <stdio.h> is sufficient; on
older Unix systems, you may need <sys/types.h> to define size_t.

If the application needs to refer to individual JPEG library error codes, also
include jerror.h to define those symbols.

jpeglib.h indirectly includes the files jconfig.h and jmorecfg.h.  If you are
installing the JPEG header files in a system directory, you will want to
install all four files: jpeglib.h, jerror.h, jconfig.h, jmorecfg.h.

The most convenient way to include the JPEG code into your executable program
is to prepare a library file ("libjpeg.a", or a corresponding name on non-Unix
machines) and reference it at your link step.  If you use only half of the
library (only compression or only decompression), only that much code will be
included from the library, unless your linker is hopelessly brain-damaged.
The supplied makefiles build libjpeg.a automatically (see install.doc).

While you can build the JPEG library as a shared library if the whim strikes
you, we don't really recommend it.  The trouble with shared libraries is that
at some point you'll probably try to substitute a new version of the library
without recompiling the calling applications.  That generally doesn't work
because the parameter struct declarations usually change with each new
version.  In other words, the library's API is *not* guaranteed binary
compatible across versions; we only try to ensure source-code compatibility.
(In hindsight, it might have been smarter to hide the parameter structs from
applications and introduce a ton of access functions instead.  Too late now,
however.)

On some systems your application may need to set up a signal handler to ensure
that temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  This is most
critical if you are on MS-DOS and use the jmemdos.c memory manager back end;
it will try to grab extended memory for temp files, and that space will NOT be
freed automatically.  See cjpeg.c or djpeg.c for an example signal handler.

It may be worth pointing out that the core JPEG library does not actually
require the stdio library: only the default source/destination managers and
error handler need it.  You can use the library in a stdio-less environment
if you replace those modules and use jmemnobs.c (or another memory manager of
your own devising).  More info about the minimum system library requirements
may be found in jinclude.h.


ADVANCED FEATURES
=================

Compression parameter selection
-------------------------------

This section describes all the optional parameters you can set for JPEG
compression, as well as the "helper" routines provided to assist in this
task.  Proper setting of some parameters requires detailed understanding
of the JPEG standard; if you don't know what a parameter is for, it's best
not to mess with it!  See REFERENCES in the README file for pointers to
more info about JPEG.

It's a good idea to call jpeg_set_defaults() first, even if you plan to set
all the parameters; that way your code is more likely to work with future JPEG
libraries that have additional parameters.  For the same reason, we recommend
you use a helper routine where one is provided, in preference to twiddling
cinfo fields directly.

The helper routines are:

jpeg_set_defaults (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	This routine sets all JPEG parameters to reasonable defaults, using
	only the input image's color space (field in_color_space, which must
	already be set in cinfo).  Many applications will only need to use
	this routine and perhaps jpeg_set_quality().

jpeg_set_colorspace (j_compress_ptr cinfo, J_COLOR_SPACE colorspace)
	Sets the JPEG file's colorspace (field jpeg_color_space) as specified,
	and sets other color-space-dependent parameters appropriately.  See
	"Special color spaces", below, before using this.  A large number of
	parameters, including all per-component parameters, are set by this
	routine; if you want to twiddle individual parameters you should call
	jpeg_set_colorspace() before rather than after.

jpeg_default_colorspace (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	Selects an appropriate JPEG colorspace based on cinfo->in_color_space,
	and calls jpeg_set_colorspace().  This is actually a subroutine of
	jpeg_set_defaults().  It's broken out in case you want to change
	just the colorspace-dependent JPEG parameters.

jpeg_set_quality (j_compress_ptr cinfo, int quality, boolean force_baseline)
	Constructs JPEG quantization tables appropriate for the indicated
	quality setting.  The quality value is expressed on the 0..100 scale
	recommended by IJG (cjpeg's "-quality" switch uses this routine).
	Note that the exact mapping from quality values to tables may change
	in future IJG releases as more is learned about DCT quantization.
	If the force_baseline parameter is TRUE, then the quantization table
	entries are constrained to the range 1..255 for full JPEG baseline
	compatibility.  In the current implementation, this only makes a
	difference for quality settings below 25, and it effectively prevents
	very small/low quality files from being generated.  The IJG decoder
	is capable of reading the non-baseline files generated at low quality
	settings when force_baseline is FALSE, but other decoders may not be.

jpeg_set_linear_quality (j_compress_ptr cinfo, int scale_factor,
			 boolean force_baseline)
	Same as jpeg_set_quality() except that the generated tables are the
	sample tables given in the JPEC spec section K.1, multiplied by the
	specified scale factor (which is expressed as a percentage; thus
	scale_factor = 100 reproduces the spec's tables).  Note that larger
	scale factors give lower quality.  This entry point is useful for
	conforming to the Adobe PostScript DCT conventions, but we do not
	recommend linear scaling as a user-visible quality scale otherwise.
	force_baseline again constrains the computed table entries to 1..255.

int jpeg_quality_scaling (int quality)
	Converts a value on the IJG-recommended quality scale to a linear
	scaling percentage.  Note that this routine may change or go away
	in future releases --- IJG may choose to adopt a scaling method that
	can't be expressed as a simple scalar multiplier, in which case the
	premise of this routine collapses.  Caveat user.

jpeg_add_quant_table (j_compress_ptr cinfo, int which_tbl,
		      const unsigned int *basic_table,
		      int scale_factor, boolean force_baseline)
	Allows an arbitrary quantization table to be created.  which_tbl
	indicates which table slot to fill.  basic_table points to an array
	of 64 unsigned ints given in normal array order.  These values are
	multiplied by scale_factor/100 and then clamped to the range 1..65535
	(or to 1..255 if force_baseline is TRUE).
	CAUTION: prior to library version 6a, jpeg_add_quant_table expected
	the basic table to be given in JPEG zigzag order.  If you need to
	write code that works with either older or newer versions of this
	routine, you must check the library version number.  Something like
	"#if JPEG_LIB_VERSION >= 61" is the right test.

jpeg_simple_progression (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	Generates a default scan script for writing a progressive-JPEG file.
	This is the recommended method of creating a progressive file,
	unless you want to make a custom scan sequence.  You must ensure that
	the JPEG color space is set correctly before calling this routine.


Compression parameters (cinfo fields) include:

J_DCT_METHOD dct_method
	Selects the algorithm used for the DCT step.  Choices are:
		JDCT_ISLOW: slow but accurate integer algorithm
		JDCT_IFAST: faster, less accurate integer method
		JDCT_FLOAT: floating-point method
		JDCT_DEFAULT: default method (normally JDCT_ISLOW)
		JDCT_FASTEST: fastest method (normally JDCT_IFAST)
	The FLOAT method is very slightly more accurate than the ISLOW method,
	but may give different results on different machines due to varying
	roundoff behavior.  The integer methods should give the same results
	on all machines.  On machines with sufficiently fast FP hardware, the
	floating-point method may also be the fastest.  The IFAST method is
	considerably less accurate than the other two; its use is not
	recommended if high quality is a concern.  JDCT_DEFAULT and
	JDCT_FASTEST are macros configurable by each installation.

J_COLOR_SPACE jpeg_color_space
int num_components
	The JPEG color space and corresponding number of components; see
	"Special color spaces", below, for more info.  We recommend using
	jpeg_set_color_space() if you want to change these.

boolean optimize_coding
	TRUE causes the compressor to compute optimal Huffman coding tables
	for the image.  This requires an extra pass over the data and
	therefore costs a good deal of space and time.  The default is
	FALSE, which tells the compressor to use the supplied or default
	Huffman tables.  In most cases optimal tables save only a few percent
	of file size compared to the default tables.  Note that when this is
	TRUE, you need not supply Huffman tables at all, and any you do
	supply will be overwritten.

unsigned int restart_interval
int restart_in_rows
	To emit restart markers in the JPEG file, set one of these nonzero.
	Set restart_interval to specify the exact interval in MCU blocks.
	Set restart_in_rows to specify the interval in MCU rows.  (If
	restart_in_rows is not 0, then restart_interval is set after the
	image width in MCUs is computed.)  Defaults are zero (no restarts).
	One restart marker per MCU row is often a good choice.
	NOTE: the overhead of restart markers is higher in grayscale JPEG
	files than in color files, and MUCH higher in progressive JPEGs.
	If you use restarts, you may want to use larger intervals in those
	cases.

const jpeg_scan_info * scan_info
int num_scans
	By default, scan_info is NULL; this causes the compressor to write a
	single-scan sequential JPEG file.  If not NULL, scan_info points to
	an array of scan definition records of length num_scans.  The
	compressor will then write a JPEG file having one scan for each scan
	definition record.  This is used to generate noninterleaved or
	progressive JPEG files.  The library checks that the scan array
	defines a valid JPEG scan sequence.  (jpeg_simple_progression creates
	a suitable scan definition array for progressive JPEG.)  This is
	discussed further under "Progressive JPEG support".

int smoothing_factor
	If non-zero, the input image is smoothed; the value should be 1 for
	minimal smoothing to 100 for maximum smoothing.  Consult jcsample.c
	for details of the smoothing algorithm.  The default is zero.

boolean write_JFIF_header
	If TRUE, a JFIF APP0 marker is emitted.  jpeg_set_defaults() and
	jpeg_set_colorspace() set this TRUE if a JFIF-legal JPEG color space
	(ie, YCbCr or grayscale) is selected, otherwise FALSE.

UINT8 JFIF_major_version
UINT8 JFIF_minor_version
	The version number to be written into the JFIF marker.
	jpeg_set_defaults() initializes the version to 1.01 (major=minor=1).
	You should set it to 1.02 (major=1, minor=2) if you plan to write
	any JFIF 1.02 extension markers.

UINT8 density_unit
UINT16 X_density
UINT16 Y_density
	The resolution information to be written into the JFIF marker;
	not used otherwise.  density_unit may be 0 for unknown,
	1 for dots/inch, or 2 for dots/cm.  The default values are 0,1,1
	indicating square pixels of unknown size.

boolean write_Adobe_marker
	If TRUE, an Adobe APP14 marker is emitted.  jpeg_set_defaults() and
	jpeg_set_colorspace() set this TRUE if JPEG color space RGB, CMYK,
	or YCCK is selected, otherwise FALSE.  It is generally a bad idea
	to set both write_JFIF_header and write_Adobe_marker.  In fact,
	you probably shouldn't change the default settings at all --- the
	default behavior ensures that the JPEG file's color space can be
	recognized by the decoder.

JQUANT_TBL * quant_tbl_ptrs[NUM_QUANT_TBLS]
	Pointers to coefficient quantization tables, one per table slot,
	or NULL if no table is defined for a slot.  Usually these should
	be set via one of the above helper routines; jpeg_add_quant_table()
	is general enough to define any quantization table.  The other
	routines will set up table slot 0 for luminance quality and table
	slot 1 for chrominance.

JHUFF_TBL * dc_huff_tbl_ptrs[NUM_HUFF_TBLS]
JHUFF_TBL * ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[NUM_HUFF_TBLS]
	Pointers to Huffman coding tables, one per table slot, or NULL if
	no table is defined for a slot.  Slots 0 and 1 are filled with the
	JPEG sample tables by jpeg_set_defaults().  If you need to allocate
	more table structures, jpeg_alloc_huff_table() may be used.
	Note that optimal Huffman tables can be computed for an image
	by setting optimize_coding, as discussed above; there's seldom
	any need to mess with providing your own Huffman tables.

There are some additional cinfo fields which are not documented here
because you currently can't change them; for example, you can't set
arith_code TRUE because arithmetic coding is unsupported.


Per-component parameters are stored in the struct cinfo.comp_info[i] for
component number i.  Note that components here refer to components of the
JPEG color space, *not* the source image color space.  A suitably large
comp_info[] array is allocated by jpeg_set_defaults(); if you choose not
to use that routine, it's up to you to allocate the array.

int component_id
	The one-byte identifier code to be recorded in the JPEG file for
	this component.  For the standard color spaces, we recommend you
	leave the default values alone.

int h_samp_factor
int v_samp_factor
	Horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the component; must
	be 1..4 according to the JPEG standard.  Note that larger sampling
	factors indicate a higher-resolution component; many people find
	this behavior quite unintuitive.  The default values are 2,2 for
	luminance components and 1,1 for chrominance components, except
	for grayscale where 1,1 is used.

int quant_tbl_no
	Quantization table number for component.  The default value is
	0 for luminance components and 1 for chrominance components.

int dc_tbl_no
int ac_tbl_no
	DC and AC entropy coding table numbers.  The default values are
	0 for luminance components and 1 for chrominance components.

int component_index
	Must equal the component's index in comp_info[].  (Beginning in
	release v6, the compressor library will fill this in automatically;
	you don't have to.)


Decompression parameter selection
---------------------------------

Decompression parameter selection is somewhat simpler than compression
parameter selection, since all of the JPEG internal parameters are
recorded in the source file and need not be supplied by the application.
(Unless you are working with abbreviated files, in which case see
"Abbreviated datastreams", below.)  Decompression parameters control
the postprocessing done on the image to deliver it in a format suitable
for the application's use.  Many of the parameters control speed/quality
tradeoffs, in which faster decompression may be obtained at the price of
a poorer-quality image.  The defaults select the highest quality (slowest)
processing.

The following fields in the JPEG object are set by jpeg_read_header() and
may be useful to the application in choosing decompression parameters:

JDIMENSION image_width			Width and height of image
JDIMENSION image_height
int num_components			Number of color components
J_COLOR_SPACE jpeg_color_space		Colorspace of image
boolean saw_JFIF_marker			TRUE if a JFIF APP0 marker was seen
  UINT8 JFIF_major_version		Version information from JFIF marker
  UINT8 JFIF_minor_version
  UINT8 density_unit			Resolution data from JFIF marker
  UINT16 X_density
  UINT16 Y_density
boolean saw_Adobe_marker		TRUE if an Adobe APP14 marker was seen
  UINT8 Adobe_transform			Color transform code from Adobe marker

The JPEG color space, unfortunately, is something of a guess since the JPEG
standard proper does not provide a way to record it.  In practice most files
adhere to the JFIF or Adobe conventions, and the decoder will recognize these
correctly.  See "Special color spaces", below, for more info.


The decompression parameters that determine the basic properties of the
returned image are:

J_COLOR_SPACE out_color_space
	Output color space.  jpeg_read_header() sets an appropriate default
	based on jpeg_color_space; typically it will be RGB or grayscale.
	The application can change this field to request output in a different
	colorspace.  For example, set it to JCS_GRAYSCALE to get grayscale
	output from a color file.  (This is useful for previewing: grayscale
	output is faster than full color since the color components need not
	be processed.)  Note that not all possible color space transforms are
	currently implemented; you may need to extend jdcolor.c if you want an
	unusual conversion.

unsigned int scale_num, scale_denom
	Scale the image by the fraction scale_num/scale_denom.  Default is
	1/1, or no scaling.  Currently, the only supported scaling ratios
	are 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8.  (The library design allows for arbitrary
	scaling ratios but this is not likely to be implemented any time soon.)
	Smaller scaling ratios permit significantly faster decoding since
	fewer pixels need be processed and a simpler IDCT method can be used.

boolean quantize_colors
	If set TRUE, colormapped output will be delivered.  Default is FALSE,
	meaning that full-color output will be delivered.

The next three parameters are relevant only if quantize_colors is TRUE.

int desired_number_of_colors
	Maximum number of colors to use in generating a library-supplied color
	map (the actual number of colors is returned in a different field).
	Default 256.  Ignored when the application supplies its own color map.

boolean two_pass_quantize
	If TRUE, an extra pass over the image is made to select a custom color
	map for the image.  This usually looks a lot better than the one-size-
	fits-all colormap that is used otherwise.  Default is TRUE.  Ignored
	when the application supplies its own color map.

J_DITHER_MODE dither_mode
	Selects color dithering method.  Supported values are:
		JDITHER_NONE	no dithering: fast, very low quality
		JDITHER_ORDERED	ordered dither: moderate speed and quality
		JDITHER_FS	Floyd-Steinberg dither: slow, high quality
	Default is JDITHER_FS.  (At present, ordered dither is implemented
	only in the single-pass, standard-colormap case.  If you ask for
	ordered dither when two_pass_quantize is TRUE or when you supply
	an external color map, you'll get F-S dithering.)

When quantize_colors is TRUE, the target color map is described by the next
two fields.  colormap is set to NULL by jpeg_read_header().  The application
can supply a color map by setting colormap non-NULL and setting
actual_number_of_colors to the map size.  Otherwise, jpeg_start_decompress()
selects a suitable color map and sets these two fields itself.
[Implementation restriction: at present, an externally supplied colormap is
only accepted for 3-component output color spaces.]

JSAMPARRAY colormap
	The color map, represented as a 2-D pixel array of out_color_components
	rows and actual_number_of_colors columns.  Ignored if not quantizing.
	CAUTION: if the JPEG library creates its own colormap, the storage
	pointed to by this field is released by jpeg_finish_decompress().
	Copy the colormap somewhere else first, if you want to save it.

int actual_number_of_colors
	The number of colors in the color map.

Additional decompression parameters that the application may set include:

J_DCT_METHOD dct_method
	Selects the algorithm used for the DCT step.  Choices are the same
	as described above for compression.

boolean do_fancy_upsampling
	If TRUE, do careful upsampling of chroma components.  If FALSE,
	a faster but sloppier method is used.  Default is TRUE.  The visual
	impact of the sloppier method is often very small.

boolean do_block_smoothing
	If TRUE, interblock smoothing is applied in early stages of decoding
	progressive JPEG files; if FALSE, not.  Default is TRUE.  Early
	progression stages look "fuzzy" with smoothing, "blocky" without.
	In any case, block smoothing ceases to be applied after the first few
	AC coefficients are known to full accuracy, so it is relevant only
	when using buffered-image mode for progressive images.

boolean enable_1pass_quant
boolean enable_external_quant
boolean enable_2pass_quant
	These are significant only in buffered-image mode, which is
	described in its own section below.


The output image dimensions are given by the following fields.  These are
computed from the source image dimensions and the decompression parameters
by jpeg_start_decompress().  You can also call jpeg_calc_output_dimensions()
to obtain the values that will result from the current parameter settings.
This can be useful if you are trying to pick a scaling ratio that will get
close to a desired target size.  It's also important if you are using the
JPEG library's memory manager to allocate output buffer space, because you
are supposed to request such buffers *before* jpeg_start_decompress().

JDIMENSION output_width		Actual dimensions of output image.
JDIMENSION output_height
int out_color_components	Number of color components in out_color_space.
int output_components		Number of color components returned.
int rec_outbuf_height		Recommended height of scanline buffer.

When quantizing colors, output_components is 1, indicating a single color map
index per pixel.  Otherwise it equals out_color_components.  The output arrays
are required to be output_width * output_components JSAMPLEs wide.

rec_outbuf_height is the recommended minimum height (in scanlines) of the
buffer passed to jpeg_read_scanlines().  If the buffer is smaller, the
library will still work, but time will be wasted due to unnecessary data
copying.  In high-quality modes, rec_outbuf_height is always 1, but some
faster, lower-quality modes set it to larger values (typically 2 to 4).
If you are going to ask for a high-speed processing mode, you may as well
go to the trouble of honoring rec_outbuf_height so as to avoid data copying.
(An output buffer larger than rec_outbuf_height lines is OK, but won't
provide any material speed improvement over that height.)


Special color spaces
--------------------

The JPEG standard itself is "color blind" and doesn't specify any particular
color space.  It is customary to convert color data to a luminance/chrominance
color space before compressing, since this permits greater compression.  The
existing de-facto JPEG file format standards specify YCbCr or grayscale data
(JFIF), or grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK, or YCCK (Adobe).  For special
applications such as multispectral images, other color spaces can be used,
but it must be understood that such files will be unportable.

The JPEG library can handle the most common colorspace conversions (namely
RGB <=> YCbCr and CMYK <=> YCCK).  It can also deal with data of an unknown
color space, passing it through without conversion.  If you deal extensively
with an unusual color space, you can easily extend the library to understand
additional color spaces and perform appropriate conversions.

For compression, the source data's color space is specified by field
in_color_space.  This is transformed to the JPEG file's color space given
by jpeg_color_space.  jpeg_set_defaults() chooses a reasonable JPEG color
space depending on in_color_space, but you can override this by calling
jpeg_set_colorspace().  Of course you must select a supported transformation.
jccolor.c currently supports the following transformations:
	RGB => YCbCr
	RGB => GRAYSCALE
	YCbCr => GRAYSCALE
	CMYK => YCCK
plus the null transforms: GRAYSCALE => GRAYSCALE, RGB => RGB,
YCbCr => YCbCr, CMYK => CMYK, YCCK => YCCK, and UNKNOWN => UNKNOWN.

The de-facto file format standards (JFIF and Adobe) specify APPn markers that
indicate the color space of the JPEG file.  It is important to ensure that
these are written correctly, or omitted if the JPEG file's color space is not
one of the ones supported by the de-facto standards.  jpeg_set_colorspace()
will set the compression parameters to include or omit the APPn markers
properly, so long as it is told the truth about the JPEG color space.
For example, if you are writing some random 3-component color space without
conversion, don't try to fake out the library by setting in_color_space and
jpeg_color_space to JCS_YCbCr; use JCS_UNKNOWN.  You may want to write an
APPn marker of your own devising to identify the colorspace --- see "Special
markers", below.

When told that the color space is UNKNOWN, the library will default to using
luminance-quality compression parameters for all color components.  You may
well want to change these parameters.  See the source code for
jpeg_set_colorspace(), in jcparam.c, for details.

For decompression, the JPEG file's color space is given in jpeg_color_space,
and this is transformed to the output color space out_color_space.
jpeg_read_header's setting of jpeg_color_space can be relied on if the file
conforms to JFIF or Adobe conventions, but otherwise it is no better than a
guess.  If you know the JPEG file's color space for certain, you can override
jpeg_read_header's guess by setting jpeg_color_space.  jpeg_read_header also
selects a default output color space based on (its guess of) jpeg_color_space;
set out_color_space to override this.  Again, you must select a supported
transformation.  jdcolor.c currently supports
	YCbCr => GRAYSCALE
	YCbCr => RGB
	GRAYSCALE => RGB
	YCCK => CMYK
as well as the null transforms.  (Since GRAYSCALE=>RGB is provided, an
application can force grayscale JPEGs to look like color JPEGs if it only
wants to handle one case.)

The two-pass color quantizer, jquant2.c, is specialized to handle RGB data
(it weights distances appropriately for RGB colors).  You'll need to modify
the code if you want to use it for non-RGB output color spaces.  Note that
jquant2.c is used to map to an application-supplied colormap as well as for
the normal two-pass colormap selection process.

CAUTION: it appears that Adobe Photoshop writes inverted data in CMYK JPEG
files: 0 represents 100% ink coverage, rather than 0% ink as you'd expect.
This is arguably a bug in Photoshop, but if you need to work with Photoshop
CMYK files, you will have to deal with it in your application.  We cannot
"fix" this in the library by inverting the data during the CMYK<=>YCCK
transform, because that would break other applications, notably Ghostscript.
Photoshop versions prior to 3.0 write EPS files containing JPEG-encoded CMYK
data in the same inverted-YCCK representation used in bare JPEG files, but
the surrounding PostScript code performs an inversion using the PS image
operator.  I am told that Photoshop 3.0 will write uninverted YCCK in
EPS/JPEG files, and will omit the PS-level inversion.  (But the data
polarity used in bare JPEG files will not change in 3.0.)  In either case,
the JPEG library must not invert the data itself, or else Ghostscript would
read these EPS files incorrectly.


Error handling
--------------

When the default error handler is used, any error detected inside the JPEG
routines will cause a message to be printed on stderr, followed by exit().
You can supply your own error handling routines to override this behavior
and to control the treatment of nonfatal warnings and trace/debug messages.
The file example.c illustrates the most common case, which is to have the
application regain control after an error rather than exiting.

The JPEG library never writes any message directly; it always goes through
the error handling routines.  Three classes of messages are recognized:
  * Fatal errors: the library cannot continue.
  * Warnings: the library can continue, but the data is corrupt, and a
    damaged output image is likely to result.
  * Trace/informational messages.  These come with a trace level indicating
    the importance of the message; you can control the verbosity of the
    program by adjusting the maximum trace level that will be displayed.

You may, if you wish, simply replace the entire JPEG error handling module
(jerror.c) with your own code.  However, you can avoid code duplication by
only replacing some of the routines depending on the behavior you need.
This is accomplished by calling jpeg_std_error() as usual, but then overriding
some of the method pointers in the jpeg_error_mgr struct, as illustrated by
example.c.

All of the error handling routines will receive a pointer to the JPEG object
(a j_common_ptr which points to either a jpeg_compress_struct or a
jpeg_decompress_struct; if you need to tell which, test the is_decompressor
field).  This struct includes a pointer to the error manager struct in its
"err" field.  Frequently, custom error handler routines will need to access
additional data which is not known to the JPEG library or the standard error
handler.  The most convenient way to do this is to embed either the JPEG
object or the jpeg_error_mgr struct in a larger structure that contains
additional fields; then casting the passed pointer provides access to the
additional fields.  Again, see example.c for one way to do it.  (Beginning
with IJG version 6b, there is also a void pointer "client_data" in each
JPEG object, which the application can also use to find related data.
The library does not touch client_data at all.)

The individual methods that you might wish to override are:

error_exit (j_common_ptr cinfo)
	Receives control for a fatal error.  Information sufficient to
	generate the error message has been stored in cinfo->err; call
	output_message to display it.  Control must NOT return to the caller;
	generally this routine will exit() or longjmp() somewhere.
	Typically you would override this routine to get rid of the exit()
	default behavior.  Note that if you continue processing, you should
	clean up the JPEG object with jpeg_abort() or jpeg_destroy().

output_message (j_common_ptr cinfo)
	Actual output of any JPEG message.  Override this to send messages
	somewhere other than stderr.  Note that this method does not know
	how to generate a message, only where to send it.

format_message (j_common_ptr cinfo, char * buffer)
	Constructs a readable error message string based on the error info
	stored in cinfo->err.  This method is called by output_message.  Few
	applications should need to override this method.  One possible
	reason for doing so is to implement dynamic switching of error message
	language.

emit_message (j_common_ptr cinfo, int msg_level)
	Decide whether or not to emit a warning or trace message; if so,
	calls output_message.  The main reason for overriding this method
	would be to abort on warnings.  msg_level is -1 for warnings,
	0 and up for trace messages.

Only error_exit() and emit_message() are called from the rest of the JPEG
library; the other two are internal to the error handler.

The actual message texts are stored in an array of strings which is pointed to
by the field err->jpeg_message_table.  The messages are numbered from 0 to
err->last_jpeg_message, and it is these code numbers that are used in the
JPEG library code.  You could replace the message texts (for instance, with
messages in French or German) by changing the message table pointer.  See
jerror.h for the default texts.  CAUTION: this table will almost certainly
change or grow from one library version to the next.

It may be useful for an application to add its own message texts that are
handled by the same mechanism.  The error handler supports a second "add-on"
message table for this purpose.  To define an addon table, set the pointer
err->addon_message_table and the message numbers err->first_addon_message and
err->last_addon_message.  If you number the addon messages beginning at 1000
or so, you won't have to worry about conflicts with the library's built-in
messages.  See the sample applications cjpeg/djpeg for an example of using
addon messages (the addon messages are defined in cderror.h).

Actual invocation of the error handler is done via macros defined in jerror.h:
	ERREXITn(...)	for fatal errors
	WARNMSn(...)	for corrupt-data warnings
	TRACEMSn(...)	for trace and informational messages.
These macros store the message code and any additional parameters into the
error handler struct, then invoke the error_exit() or emit_message() method.
The variants of each macro are for varying numbers of additional parameters.
The additional parameters are inserted into the generated message using
standard printf() format codes.

See jerror.h and jerror.c for further details.


Compressed data handling (source and destination managers)
----------------------------------------------------------

The JPEG compression library sends its compressed data to a "destination
manager" module.  The default destination manager just writes the data to a
stdio stream, but you can provide your own manager to do something else.
Similarly, the decompression library calls a "source manager" to obtain the
compressed data; you can provide your own source manager if you want the data
to come from somewhere other than a stdio stream.

In both cases, compressed data is processed a bufferload at a time: the
destination or source manager provides a work buffer, and the library invokes
the manager only when the buffer is filled or emptied.  (You could define a
one-character buffer to force the manager to be invoked for each byte, but
that would be rather inefficient.)  The buffer's size and location are
controlled by the manager, not by the library.  For example, if you desired to
decompress a JPEG datastream that was all in memory, you could just make the
buffer pointer and length point to the original data in memory.  Then the
buffer-reload procedure would be invoked only if the decompressor ran off the
end of the datastream, which would indicate an erroneous datastream.

The work buffer is defined as an array of datatype JOCTET, which is generally
"char" or "unsigned char".  On a machine where char is not exactly 8 bits
wide, you must define JOCTET as a wider data type and then modify the data
source and destination modules to transcribe the work arrays into 8-bit units
on external storage.

A data destination manager struct contains a pointer and count defining the
next byte to write in the work buffer and the remaining free space:

	JOCTET * next_output_byte;  /* => next byte to write in buffer */
	size_t free_in_buffer;      /* # of byte spaces remaining in buffer */

The library increments the pointer and decrements the count until the buffer
is filled.  The manager's empty_output_buffer method must reset the pointer
and count.  The manager is expected to remember the buffer's starting address
and total size in private fields not visible to the library.

A data destination manager provides three methods:

init_destination (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	Initialize destination.  This is called by jpeg_start_compress()
	before any data is actually written.  It must initialize
	next_output_byte and free_in_buffer.  free_in_buffer must be
	initialized to a positive value.

empty_output_buffer (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	This is called whenever the buffer has filled (free_in_buffer
	reaches zero).  In typical applications, it should write out the
	*entire* buffer (use the saved start address and buffer length;
	ignore the current state of next_output_byte and free_in_buffer).
	Then reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and
	return TRUE indicating that the buffer has been dumped.
	free_in_buffer must be set to a positive value when TRUE is
	returned.  A FALSE return should only be used when I/O suspension is
	desired (this operating mode is discussed in the next section).

term_destination (j_compress_ptr cinfo)
	Terminate destination --- called by jpeg_finish_compress() after all
	data has been written.  In most applications, this must flush any
	data remaining in the buffer.  Use either next_output_byte or
	free_in_buffer to determine how much data is in the buffer.

term_destination() is NOT called by jpeg_abort() or jpeg_destroy().  If you
want the destination manager to be cleaned up during an abort, you must do it
yourself.

You will also need code to create a jpeg_destination_mgr struct, fill in its
method pointers, and insert a pointer to the struct into the "dest" field of
the JPEG compression object.  This can be done in-line in your setup code if
you like, but it's probably cleaner to provide a separate routine similar to
the jpeg_stdio_dest() routine of the supplied destination manager.

Decompression source managers follow a parallel design, but with some
additional frammishes.  The source manager struct contains a pointer and count
defining the next byte to read from the work buffer and the number of bytes
remaining:

	const JOCTET * next_input_byte; /* => next byte to read from buffer */
	size_t bytes_in_buffer;         /* # of bytes remaining in buffer */

The library increments the pointer and decrements the count until the buffer
is emptied.  The manager's fill_input_buffer method must reset the pointer and
count.  In most applications, the manager must remember the buffer's starting
address and total size in private fields not visible to the library.

A data source manager provides five methods:

init_source (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)
	Initialize source.  This is called by jpeg_read_header() before any
	data is actually read.  Unlike init_destination(), it may leave
	bytes_in_buffer set to 0 (in which case a fill_input_buffer() call
	will occur immediately).

fill_input_buffer (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)
	This is called whenever bytes_in_buffer has reached zero and more
	data is wanted.  In typical applications, it should read fresh data
	into the buffer (ignoring the current state of next_input_byte and
	bytes_in_buffer), reset the pointer & count to the start of the
	buffer, and return TRUE indicating that the buffer has been reloaded.
	It is not necessary to fill the buffer entirely, only to obtain at
	least one more byte.  bytes_in_buffer MUST be set to a positive value
	if TRUE is returned.  A FALSE return should only be used when I/O
	suspension is desired (this mode is discussed in the next section).

skip_input_data (j_decompress_ptr cinfo, long num_bytes)
	Skip num_bytes worth of data.  The buffer pointer and count should
	be advanced over num_bytes input bytes, refilling the buffer as
	needed.  This is used to skip over a potentially large amount of
	uninteresting data (such as an APPn marker).  In some applications
	it may be possible to optimize away the reading of the skipped data,
	but it's not clear that being smart is worth much trouble; large
	skips are uncommon.  bytes_in_buffer may be zero on return.
	A zero or negative skip count should be treated as a no-op.

resync_to_restart (j_decompress_ptr cinfo, int desired)
	This routine is called only when the decompressor has failed to find
	a restart (RSTn) marker where one is expected.  Its mission is to
	find a suitable point for resuming decompression.  For most
	applications, we recommend that you just use the default resync
	procedure, jpeg_resync_to_restart().  However, if you are able to back
	up in the input data stream, or if you have a-priori knowledge about
	the likely location of restart markers, you may be able to do better.
	Read the read_restart_marker() and jpeg_resync_to_restart() routines
	in jdmarker.c if you think you'd like to implement your own resync
	procedure.

term_source (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)
	Terminate source --- called by jpeg_finish_decompress() after all
	data has been read.  Often a no-op.

For both fill_input_buffer() and skip_input_data(), there is no such thing
as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been reached, the routine has
a choice of exiting via ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into the buffer.
In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a fake EOI marker
is the best course of action --- this will allow the decompressor to output
however much of the image is there.  In pathological cases, the decompressor
may swallow the EOI and again demand data ... just keep feeding it fake EOIs.
jdatasrc.c illustrates the recommended error recovery behavior.

term_source() is NOT called by jpeg_abort() or jpeg_destroy().  If you want
the source manager to be cleaned up during an abort, you must do it yourself.

You will also need code to create a jpeg_source_mgr struct, fill in its method
pointers, and insert a pointer to the struct into the "src" field of the JPEG
decompression object.  This can be done in-line in your setup code if you
like, but it's probably cleaner to provide a separate routine similar to the
jpeg_stdio_src() routine of the supplied source manager.

For more information, consult the stdio source and destination managers
in jdatasrc.c and jdatadst.c.


I/O suspension
--------------

Some applications need to use the JPEG library as an incremental memory-to-
memory filter: when the compressed data buffer is filled or emptied, they want
control to return to the outer loop, rather than expecting that the buffer can
be emptied or reloaded within the data source/destination manager subroutine.
The library supports this need by providing an "I/O suspension" mode, which we
describe in this section.

The I/O suspension mode is not a panacea: nothing is guaranteed about the
maximum amount of time spent in any one call to the library, so it will not
eliminate response-time problems in single-threaded applications.  If you
need guaranteed response time, we suggest you "bite the bullet" and implement
a real multi-tasking capability.

To use I/O suspension, cooperation is needed between the calling application
and the data source or destination manager; you will always need a custom
source/destination manager.  (Please read the previous section if you haven't
already.)  The basic idea is that the empty_output_buffer() or
fill_input_buffer() routine is a no-op, merely returning FALSE to indicate
that it has done nothing.  Upon seeing this, the JPEG library suspends
operation and returns to its caller.  The surrounding application is
responsible for emptying or refilling the work buffer before calling the
JPEG library again.

Compression suspension:

For compression suspension, use an empty_output_buffer() routine that returns
FALSE; typically it will not do anything else.  This will cause the
compressor to return to the caller of jpeg_write_scanlines(), with the return
value indicating that not all the supplied scanlines have been accepted.
The application must make more room in the output buffer, adjust the output
buffer pointer/count appropriately, and then call jpeg_write_scanlines()
again, pointing to the first unconsumed scanline.

When forced to suspend, the compressor will backtrack to a convenient stopping
point (usually the start of the current MCU); it will regenerate some output
data when restarted.  Therefore, although empty_output_buffer() is only
called when the buffer is filled, you should NOT write out the entire buffer
after a suspension.  Write only the data up to the current position of
next_output_byte/free_in_buffer.  The data beyond that point will be
regenerated after resumption.

Because of the backtracking behavior, a good-size output buffer is essential
for efficiency; you don't want the compressor to suspend often.  (In fact, an
overly small buffer could lead to infinite looping, if a single MCU required
more data than would fit in the buffer.)  We recommend a buffer of at least
several Kbytes.  You may want to insert explicit code to ensure that you don't
call jpeg_write_scanlines() unless there is a reasonable amount of space in
the output buffer; in other words, flush the buffer before trying to compress
more data.

The compressor does not allow suspension while it is trying to write JPEG
markers at the beginning and end of the file.  This means that:
  * At the beginning of a compression operation, there must be enough free
    space in the output buffer to hold the header markers (typically 600 or
    so bytes).  The recommended buffer size is bigger than this anyway, so
    this is not a problem as long as you start with an empty buffer.  However,
    this restriction might catch you if you insert large special markers, such
    as a JFIF thumbnail image, without flushing the buffer afterwards.
  * When you call jpeg_finish_compress(), there must be enough space in the
    output buffer to emit any buffered data and the final EOI marker.  In the
    current implementation, half a dozen bytes should suffice for this, but
    for safety's sake we recommend ensuring that at least 100 bytes are free
    before calling jpeg_finish_compress().

A more significant restriction is that jpeg_finish_compress() cannot suspend.
This means you cannot use suspension with multi-pass operating modes, namely
Huffman code optimization and multiple-scan output.  Those modes write the
whole file during jpeg_finish_compress(), which will certainly result in
buffer overrun.  (Note that this restriction applies only to compression,
not decompression.  The decompressor supports input suspension in all of its
operating modes.)

Decompression suspension:

For decompression suspension, use a fill_input_buffer() routine that simply
returns FALSE (except perhaps during error recovery, as discussed below).
This will cause the decompressor to return to its caller with an indication
that suspension has occurred.  This can happen at four places:
  * jpeg_read_header(): will return JPEG_SUSPENDED.
  * jpeg_start_decompress(): will return FALSE, rather than its usual TRUE.
  * jpeg_read_scanlines(): will return the number of scanlines already
	completed (possibly 0).
  * jpeg_finish_decompress(): will return FALSE, rather than its usual TRUE.
The surrounding application must recognize these cases, load more data into
the input buffer, and repeat the call.  In the case of jpeg_read_scanlines(),
increment the passed pointers past any scanlines successfully read.

Just as with compression, the decompressor will typically backtrack to a
convenient restart point before suspending.  When fill_input_buffer() is
called, next_input_byte/bytes_in_buffer point to the current restart point,
which is where the decompressor will backtrack to if FALSE is returned.
The data beyond that position must NOT be discarded if you suspend; it needs
to be re-read upon resumption.  In most implementations, you'll need to shift
this data down to the start of your work buffer and then load more data after
it.  Again, this behavior means that a several-Kbyte work buffer is essential
for decent performance; furthermore, you should load a reasonable amount of
new data before resuming decompression.  (If you loaded, say, only one new
byte each time around, you could waste a LOT of cycles.)

The skip_input_data() source manager routine requires special care in a
suspension scenario.  This routine is NOT granted the ability to suspend the
decompressor; it can decrement bytes_in_buffer to zero, but no more.  If the
requested skip distance exceeds the amount of data currently in the input
buffer, then skip_input_data() must set bytes_in_buffer to zero and record the
additional skip distance somewhere else.  The decompressor will immediately
call fill_input_buffer(), which should return FALSE, which will cause a
suspension return.  The surrounding application must then arrange to discard
the recorded number of bytes before it resumes loading the input buffer.
(Yes, this design is rather baroque, but it avoids complexity in the far more
common case where a non-suspending source manager is used.)

If the input data has been exhausted, we recommend that you emit a warning
and insert dummy EOI markers just as a non-suspending data source manager
would do.  This can be handled either in the surrounding application logic or
within fill_input_buffer(); the latter is probably more efficient.  If
fill_input_buffer() knows that no more data is available, it can set the
pointer/count to point to a dummy EOI marker and then return TRUE just as
though it had read more data in a non-suspending situation.

The decompressor does not attempt to suspend within standard JPEG markers;
instead it will backtrack to the start of the marker and reprocess the whole
marker next time.  Hence the input buffer must be large enough to hold the
longest standard marker in the file.  Standard JPEG markers should normally
not exceed a few hundred bytes each (DHT tables are typically the longest).
We recommend at least a 2K buffer for performance reasons, which is much
larger than any correct marker is likely to be.  For robustness against
damaged marker length counts, you may wish to insert a test in your
application for the case that the input buffer is completely full and yet
the decoder has suspended without consuming any data --- otherwise, if this
situation did occur, it would lead to an endless loop.  (The library can't
provide this test since it has no idea whether "the buffer is full", or
even whether there is a fixed-size input buffer.)

The input buffer would need to be 64K to allow for arbitrary COM or APPn
markers, but these are handled specially: they are either saved into allocated
memory, or skipped over by calling skip_input_data().  In the former case,
suspension is handled correctly, and in the latter case, the problem of
buffer overrun is placed on skip_input_data's shoulders, as explained above.
Note that if you provide your own marker handling routine for large markers,
you should consider how to deal with buffer overflow.

Multiple-buffer management:

In some applications it is desirable to store the compressed data in a linked
list of buffer areas, so as to avoid data copying.  This can be handled by
having empty_output_buffer() or fill_input_buffer() set the pointer and count
to reference the next available buffer; FALSE is returned only if no more
buffers are available.  Although seemingly straightforward, there is a
pitfall in this approach: the backtrack that occurs when FALSE is returned
could back up into an earlier buffer.  For example, when fill_input_buffer()
is called, the current pointer & count indicate the backtrack restart point.
Since fill_input_buffer() will set the pointer and count to refer to a new
buffer, the restart position must be saved somewhere else.  Suppose a second
call to fill_input_buffer() occurs in the same library call, and no
additional input data is available, so fill_input_buffer must return FALSE.
If the JPEG library has not moved the pointer/count forward in the current
buffer, then *the correct restart point is the saved position in the prior
buffer*.  Prior buffers may be discarded only after the library establishes
a restart point within a later buffer.  Similar remarks apply for output into
a chain of buffers.

The library will never attempt to backtrack over a skip_input_data() call,
so any skipped data can be permanently discarded.  You still have to deal
with the case of skipping not-yet-received data, however.

It's much simpler to use only a single buffer; when fill_input_buffer() is
called, move any unconsumed data (beyond the current pointer/count) down to
the beginning of this buffer and then load new data into the remaining buffer
space.  This approach requires a little more data copying but is far easier
to get right.


Progressive JPEG support
------------------------

Progressive JPEG rearranges the stored data into a series of scans of
increasing quality.  In situations where a JPEG file is transmitted across a
slow communications link, a decoder can generate a low-quality image very
quickly from the first scan, then gradually improve the displayed quality as
more scans are received.  The final image after all scans are complete is
identical to that of a regular (sequential) JPEG file of the same quality
setting.  Progressive JPEG files are often slightly smaller than equivalent
sequential JPEG files, but the possibility of incremental display is the main
reason for using progressive JPEG.

The IJG encoder library generates progressive JPEG files when given a
suitable "scan script" defining how to divide the data into scans.
Creation of progressive JPEG files is otherwise transparent to the encoder.
Progressive JPEG files can also be read transparently by the decoder library.
If the decoding application simply uses the library as defined above, it
will receive a final decoded image without any indication that the file was
progressive.  Of course, this approach does not allow incremental display.
To perform incremental display, an application needs to use the decoder
library's "buffered-image" mode, in which it receives a decoded image
multiple times.

Each displayed scan requires about as much work to decode as a full JPEG
image of the same size, so the decoder must be fairly fast in relation to the
data transmission rate in order to make incremental display useful.  However,
it is possible to skip displaying the image and simply add the incoming bits
to the decoder's coefficient buffer.  This is fast because only Huffman
decoding need be done, not IDCT, upsampling, colorspace conversion, etc.
The IJG decoder library allows the application to switch dynamically between
displaying the image and simply absorbing the incoming bits.  A properly
coded application can automatically adapt the number of display passes to
suit the time available as the image is received.  Also, a final
higher-quality display cycle can be performed from the buffered data after
the end of the file is reached.

Progressive compression:

To create a progressive JPEG file (or a multiple-scan sequential JPEG file),
set the scan_info cinfo field to point to an array of scan descriptors, and
perform compression as usual.  Instead of constructing your own scan list,
you can call the jpeg_simple_progression() helper routine to create a
recommended progression sequence; this method should be used by all
applications that don't want to get involved in the nitty-gritty of
progressive scan sequence design.  (If you want to provide user control of
scan sequences, you may wish to borrow the scan script reading code found
in rdswitch.c, so that you can read scan script files just like cjpeg's.)
When scan_info is not NULL, the compression library will store DCT'd data
into a buffer array as jpeg_write_scanlines() is called, and will emit all
the requested scans during jpeg_finish_compress().  This implies that
multiple-scan output cannot be created with a suspending data destination
manager, since jpeg_finish_compress() does not support suspension.  We
should also note that the compressor currently forces Huffman optimization
mode when creating a progressive JPEG file, because the default Huffman
tables are unsuitable for progressive files.

Progressive decompression:

When buffered-image mode is not used, the decoder library will read all of
a multi-scan file during jpeg_start_decompress(), so that it can provide a
final decoded image.  (Here "multi-scan" means either progressive or
multi-scan sequential.)  This makes multi-scan files transparent to the
decoding application.  However, existing applications that used suspending
input with version 5 of the IJG library will need to be modified to check
for a suspension return from jpeg_start_decompress().

To perform incremental display, an application must use the library's
buffered-image mode.  This is described in the next section.


Buffered-image mode
-------------------

In buffered-image mode, the library stores the partially decoded image in a
coefficient buffer, from which it can be read out as many times as desired.
This mode is typically used for incremental display of progressive JPEG files,
but it can be used with any JPEG file.  Each scan of a progressive JPEG file
adds more data (more detail) to the buffered image.  The application can
display in lockstep with the source file (one display pass per input scan),
or it can allow input processing to outrun display processing.  By making
input and display processing run independently, it is possible for the
application to adapt progressive display to a wide range of data transmission
rates.

The basic control flow for buffered-image decoding is

	jpeg_create_decompress()
	set data source
	jpeg_read_header()
	set overall decompression parameters
	cinfo.buffered_image = TRUE;	/* select buffered-image mode */
	jpeg_start_decompress()
	for (each output pass) {
	    adjust output decompression parameters if required
	    jpeg_start_output()		/* start a new output pass */
	    for (all scanlines in image) {
	        jpeg_read_scanlines()
	        display scanlines
	    }
	    jpeg_finish_output()	/* terminate output pass */
	}
	jpeg_finish_decompress()
	jpeg_destroy_decompress()

This differs from ordinary unbuffered decoding in that there is an additional
level of looping.  The application can choose how many output passes to make
and how to display each pass.

The simplest approach to displaying progressive images is to do one display
pass for each scan appearing in the input file.  In this case the outer loop
condition is typically
	while (! jpeg_input_complete(&cinfo))
and the start-output call should read
	jpeg_start_output(&cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
The second parameter to jpeg_start_output() indicates which scan of the input
file is to be displayed; the scans are numbered starting at 1 for this
purpose.  (You can use a loop counter starting at 1 if you like, but using
the library's input scan counter is easier.)  The library automatically reads
data as necessary to complete each requested scan, and jpeg_finish_output()
advances to the next scan or end-of-image marker (hence input_scan_number
will be incremented by the time control arrives back at jpeg_start_output()).
With this technique, data is read from the input file only as needed, and
input and output processing run in lockstep.

After reading the final scan and reaching the end of the input file, the
buffered image remains available; it can be read additional times by
repeating the jpeg_start_output()/jpeg_read_scanlines()/jpeg_finish_output()
sequence.  For example, a useful technique is to use fast one-pass color
quantization for display passes made while the image is arriving, followed by
a final display pass using two-pass quantization for highest quality.  This
is done by changing the library parameters before the final output pass.
Changing parameters between passes is discussed in detail below.

In general the last scan of a progressive file cannot be recognized as such
until after it is read, so a post-input display pass is the best approach if
you want special processing in the final pass.

When done with the image, be sure to call jpeg_finish_decompress() to release
the buffered image (or just use jpeg_destroy_decompress()).

If input data arrives faster than it can be displayed, the application can
cause the library to decode input data in advance of what's needed to produce
output.  This is done by calling the routine jpeg_consume_input().
The return value is one of the following:
	JPEG_REACHED_SOS:    reached an SOS marker (the start of a new scan)
	JPEG_REACHED_EOI:    reached the EOI marker (end of image)
	JPEG_ROW_COMPLETED:  completed reading one MCU row of compressed data
	JPEG_SCAN_COMPLETED: completed reading last MCU row of current scan
	JPEG_SUSPENDED:      suspended before completing any of the above
(JPEG_SUSPENDED can occur only if a suspending data source is used.)  This
routine can be called at any time after initializing the JPEG object.  It
reads some additional data and returns when one of the indicated significant
events occurs.  (If called after the EOI marker is reached, it will
immediately return JPEG_REACHED_EOI without attempting to read more data.)

The library's output processing will automatically call jpeg_consume_input()
whenever the output processing overtakes the input; thus, simple lockstep
display requires no direct calls to jpeg_consume_input().  But by adding
calls to jpeg_consume_input(), you can absorb data in advance of what is
being displayed.  This has two benefits:
  * You can limit buildup of unprocessed data in your input buffer.
  * You can eliminate extra display passes by paying attention to the
    state of the library's input processing.

The first of these benefits only requires interspersing calls to
jpeg_consume_input() with your display operations and any other processing
you may be doing.  To avoid wasting cycles due to backtracking, it's best to
call jpeg_consume_input() only after a hundred or so new bytes have arrived.
This is discussed further under "I/O suspension", above.  (Note: the JPEG
library currently is not thread-safe.  You must not call jpeg_consume_input()
from one thread of control if a different library routine is working on the
same JPEG object in another thread.)

When input arrives fast enough that more than one new scan is available
before you start a new output pass, you may as well skip the output pass
corresponding to the completed scan.  This occurs for free if you pass
cinfo.input_scan_number as the target scan number to jpeg_start_output().
The input_scan_number field is simply the index of the scan currently being
consumed by the input processor.  You can ensure that this is up-to-date by
emptying the input buffer just before calling jpeg_start_output(): call
jpeg_consume_input() repeatedly until it returns JPEG_SUSPENDED or
JPEG_REACHED_EOI.

The target scan number passed to jpeg_start_output() is saved in the
cinfo.output_scan_number field.  The library's output processing calls
jpeg_consume_input() whenever the current input scan number and row within
that scan is less than or equal to the current output scan number and row.
Thus, input processing can "get ahead" of the output processing but is not
allowed to "fall behind".  You can achieve several different effects by
manipulating this interlock rule.  For example, if you pass a target scan
number greater than the current input scan number, the output processor will
wait until that scan starts to arrive before producing any output.  (To avoid
an infinite loop, the target scan number is automatically reset to the last
scan number when the end of image is reached.  Thus, if you specify a large
target scan number, the library will just absorb the entire input file and
then perform an output pass.  This is effectively the same as what
jpeg_start_decompress() does when you don't select buffered-image mode.)
When you pass a target scan number equal to the current input scan number,
the image is displayed no faster than the current input scan arrives.  The
final possibility is to pass a target scan number less than the current input
scan number; this disables the input/output interlock and causes the output
processor to simply display whatever it finds in the image buffer, without
waiting for input.  (However, the library will not accept a target scan
number less than one, so you can't avoid waiting for the first scan.)

When data is arriving faster than the output display processing can advance
through the image, jpeg_consume_input() will store data into the buffered
image beyond the point at which the output processing is reading data out
again.  If the input arrives fast enough, it may "wrap around" the buffer to
the point where the input is more than one whole scan ahead of the output.
If the output processing simply proceeds through its display pass without
paying attention to the input, the effect seen on-screen is that the lower
part of the image is one or more scans better in quality than the upper part.
Then, when the next output scan is started, you have a choice of what target
scan number to use.  The recommended choice is to use the current input scan
number at that time, which implies that you've skipped the output scans
corresponding to the input scans that were completed while you processed the
previous output scan.  In this way, the decoder automatically adapts its
speed to the arriving data, by skipping output scans as necessary to keep up
with the arriving data.

When using this strategy, you'll want to be sure that you perform a final
output pass after receiving all the data; otherwise your last display may not
be full quality across the whole screen.  So the right outer loop logic is
something like this:
	do {
	    absorb any waiting input by calling jpeg_consume_input()
	    final_pass = jpeg_input_complete(&cinfo);
	    adjust output decompression parameters if required
	    jpeg_start_output(&cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
	    ...
	    jpeg_finish_output()
	} while (! final_pass);
rather than quitting as soon as jpeg_input_complete() returns TRUE.  This
arrangement makes it simple to use higher-quality decoding parameters
for the final pass.  But if you don't want to use special parameters for
the final pass, the right loop logic is like this:
	for (;;) {
	    absorb any waiting input by calling jpeg_consume_input()
	    jpeg_start_output(&cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
	    ...
	    jpeg_finish_output()
	    if (jpeg_input_complete(&cinfo) &&
	        cinfo.input_scan_number == cinfo.output_scan_number)
	      break;
	}
In this case you don't need to know in advance whether an output pass is to
be the last one, so it's not necessary to have reached EOF before starting
the final output pass; rather, what you want to test is whether the output
pass was performed in sync with the final input scan.  This form of the loop
will avoid an extra output pass whenever the decoder is able (or nearly able)
to keep up with the incoming data.

When the data transmission speed is high, you might begin a display pass,
then find that much or all of the file has arrived before you can complete
the pass.  (You can detect this by noting the JPEG_REACHED_EOI return code
from jpeg_consume_input(), or equivalently by testing jpeg_input_complete().)
In this situation you may wish to abort the current display pass and start a
new one using the newly arrived information.  To do so, just call
jpeg_finish_output() and then start a new pass with jpeg_start_output().

A variant strategy is to abort and restart display if more than one complete
scan arrives during an output pass; this can be detected by noting
JPEG_REACHED_SOS returns and/or examining cinfo.input_scan_number.  This
idea should be employed with caution, however, since the display process
might never get to the bottom of the image before being aborted, resulting
in the lower part of the screen being several passes worse than the upper.
In most cases it's probably best to abort an output pass only if the whole
file has arrived and you want to begin the final output pass immediately.

When receiving data across a communication link, we recommend always using
the current input scan number for the output target scan number; if a
higher-quality final pass is to be done, it should be started (aborting any
incomplete output pass) as soon as the end of file is received.  However,
many other strategies are possible.  For example, the application can examine
the parameters of the current input scan and decide whether to display it or
not.  If the scan contains only chroma data, one might choose not to use it
as the target scan, expecting that the scan will be small and will arrive
quickly.  To skip to the next scan, call jpeg_consume_input() until it
returns JPEG_REACHED_SOS or JPEG_REACHED_EOI.  Or just use the next higher
number as the target scan for jpeg_start_output(); but that method doesn't
let you inspect the next scan's parameters before deciding to display it.


In buffered-image mode, jpeg_start_decompress() never performs input and
thus never suspends.  An application that uses input suspension with
buffered-image mode must be prepared for suspension returns from these
routines:
* jpeg_start_output() performs input only if you request 2-pass quantization
  and the target scan isn't fully read yet.  (This is discussed below.)
* jpeg_read_scanlines(), as always, returns the number of scanlines that it
  was able to produce before suspending.
* jpeg_finish_output() will read any markers following the target scan,
  up to the end of the file or the SOS marker that begins another scan.
  (But it reads no input if jpeg_consume_input() has already reached the
  end of the file or a SOS marker beyond the target output scan.)
* jpeg_finish_decompress() will read until the end of file, and thus can
  suspend if the end hasn't already been reached (as can be tested by
  calling jpeg_input_complete()).
jpeg_start_output(), jpeg_finish_output(), and jpeg_finish_decompress()
all return TRUE if they completed their tasks, FALSE if they had to suspend.
In the event of a FALSE return, the application must load more input data
and repeat the call.  Applications that use non-suspending data sources need
not check the return values of these three routines.


It is possible to change decoding parameters between output passes in the
buffered-image mode.  The decoder library currently supports only very
limited changes of parameters.  ONLY THE FOLLOWING parameter changes are
allowed after jpeg_start_decompress() is called:
* dct_method can be changed before each call to jpeg_start_output().
  For example, one could use a fast DCT method for early scans, changing
  to a higher quality method for the final scan.
* dither_mode can be changed before each call to jpeg_start_output();
  of course this has no impact if not using color quantization.  Typically
  one would use ordered dither for initial passes, then switch to
  Floyd-Steinberg dither for the final pass.  Caution: changing dither mode
  can cause more memory to be allocated by the library.  Although the amount
  of memory involved is not large (a scanline or so), it may cause the
  initial max_memory_to_use specification to be exceeded, which in the worst
  case would result in an out-of-memory failure.
* do_block_smoothing can be changed before each call to jpeg_start_output().
  This setting is relevant only when decoding a progressive JPEG image.
  During the first DC-only scan, block smoothing provides a very "fuzzy" look
  instead of the very "blocky" look seen without it; which is better seems a
  matter of personal taste.  But block smoothing is nearly always a win
  during later stages, especially when decoding a successive-approximation
  image: smoothing helps to hide the slight blockiness that otherwise shows
  up on smooth gradients until the lowest coefficient bits are sent.
* Color quantization mode can be changed under the rules described below.
  You *cannot* change between full-color and quantized output (because that
  would alter the required I/O buffer sizes), but you can change which
  quantization method is used.

When generating color-quantized output, changing quantization method is a
very useful way of switching between high-speed and high-quality display.
The library allows you to change among its three quantization methods:
1. Single-pass quantization to a fixed color cube.
   Selected by cinfo.two_pass_quantize = FALSE and cinfo.colormap = NULL.
2. Single-pass quantization to an application-supplied colormap.
   Selected by setting cinfo.colormap to point to the colormap (the value of
   two_pass_quantize is ignored); also set cinfo.actual_number_of_colors.
3. Two-pass quantization to a colormap chosen specifically for the image.
   Selected by cinfo.two_pass_quantize = TRUE and cinfo.colormap = NULL.
   (This is the default setting selected by jpeg_read_header, but it is
   probably NOT what you want for the first pass of progressive display!)
These methods offer successively better quality and lesser speed.  However,
only the first method is available for quantizing in non-RGB color spaces.

IMPORTANT: because the different quantizer methods have very different
working-storage requirements, the library requires you to indicate which
one(s) you intend to use before you call jpeg_start_decompress().  (If we did
not require this, the max_memory_to_use setting would be a complete fiction.)
You do this by setting one or more of these three cinfo fields to TRUE:
	enable_1pass_quant		Fixed color cube colormap
	enable_external_quant		Externally-supplied colormap
	enable_2pass_quant		Two-pass custom colormap
All three are initialized FALSE by jpeg_read_header().  But
jpeg_start_decompress() automatically sets TRUE the one selected by the
current two_pass_quantize and colormap settings, so you only need to set the
enable flags for any other quantization methods you plan to change to later.

After setting the enable flags correctly at jpeg_start_decompress() time, you
can change to any enabled quantization method by setting two_pass_quantize
and colormap properly just before calling jpeg_start_output().  The following
special rules apply:
1. You must explicitly set cinfo.colormap to NULL when switching to 1-pass
   or 2-pass mode from a different mode, or when you want the 2-pass
   quantizer to be re-run to generate a new colormap.
2. To switch to an external colormap, or to change to a different external
   colormap than was used on the prior pass, you must call
   jpeg_new_colormap() after setting cinfo.colormap.
NOTE: if you want to use the same colormap as was used in the prior pass,
you should not do either of these things.  This will save some nontrivial
switchover costs.
(These requirements exist because cinfo.colormap will always be non-NULL
after completing a prior output pass, since both the 1-pass and 2-pass
quantizers set it to point to their output colormaps.  Thus you have to
do one of these two things to notify the library that something has changed.
Yup, it's a bit klugy, but it's necessary to do it this way for backwards
compatibility.)

Note that in buffered-image mode, the library generates any requested colormap
during jpeg_start_output(), not during jpeg_start_decompress().

When using two-pass quantization, jpeg_start_output() makes a pass over the
buffered image to determine the optimum color map; it therefore may take a
significant amount of time, whereas ordinarily it does little work.  The
progress monitor hook is called during this pass, if defined.  It is also
important to realize that if the specified target scan number is greater than
or equal to the current input scan number, jpeg_start_output() will attempt
to consume input as it makes this pass.  If you use a suspending data source,
you need to check for a FALSE return from jpeg_start_output() under these
conditions.  The combination of 2-pass quantization and a not-yet-fully-read
target scan is the only case in which jpeg_start_output() will consume input.


Application authors who support buffered-image mode may be tempted to use it
for all JPEG images, even single-scan ones.  This will work, but it is
inefficient: there is no need to create an image-sized coefficient buffer for
single-scan images.  Requesting buffered-image mode for such an image wastes
memory.  Worse, it can cost time on large images, since the buffered data has
to be swapped out or written to a temporary file.  If you are concerned about
maximum performance on baseline JPEG files, you should use buffered-image
mode only when the incoming file actually has multiple scans.  This can be
tested by calling jpeg_has_multiple_scans(), which will return a correct
result at any time after jpeg_read_header() completes.

It is also worth noting that when you use jpeg_consume_input() to let input
processing get ahead of output processing, the resulting pattern of access to
the coefficient buffer is quite nonsequential.  It's best to use the memory
manager jmemnobs.c if you can (ie, if you have enough real or virtual main
memory).  If not, at least make sure that max_memory_to_use is set as high as
possible.  If the JPEG memory manager has to use a temporary file, you will
probably see a lot of disk traffic and poor performance.  (This could be
improved with additional work on the memory manager, but we haven't gotten
around to it yet.)

In some applications it may be convenient to use jpeg_consume_input() for all
input processing, including reading the initial markers; that is, you may
wish to call jpeg_consume_input() instead of jpeg_read_header() during
startup.  This works, but note that you must check for JPEG_REACHED_SOS and
JPEG_REACHED_EOI return codes as the equivalent of jpeg_read_header's codes.
Once the first SOS marker has been reached, you must call
jpeg_start_decompress() before jpeg_consume_input() will consume more input;
it'll just keep returning JPEG_REACHED_SOS until you do.  If you read a
tables-only file this way, jpeg_consume_input() will return JPEG_REACHED_EOI
without ever returning JPEG_REACHED_SOS; be sure to check for this case.
If this happens, the decompressor will not read any more input until you call
jpeg_abort() to reset it.  It is OK to call jpeg_consume_input() even when not
using buffered-image mode, but in that case it's basically a no-op after the
initial markers have been read: it will just return JPEG_SUSPENDED.


Abbreviated datastreams and multiple images
-------------------------------------------

A JPEG compression or decompression object can be reused to process multiple
images.  This saves a small amount of time per image by eliminating the
"create" and "destroy" operations, but that isn't the real purpose of the
feature.  Rather, reuse of an object provides support for abbreviated JPEG
datastreams.  Object reuse can also simplify processing a series of images in
a single input or output file.  This section explains these features.

A JPEG file normally contains several hundred bytes worth of quantization
and Huffman tables.  In a situation where many images will be stored or
transmitted with identical tables, this may represent an annoying overhead.
The JPEG standard therefore permits tables to be omitted.  The standard
defines three classes of JPEG datastreams:
  * "Interchange" datastreams contain an image and all tables needed to decode
     the image.  These are the usual kind of JPEG file.
  * "Abbreviated image" datastreams contain an image, but are missing some or
    all of the tables needed to decode that image.
  * "Abbreviated table specification" (henceforth "tables-only") datastreams
    contain only table specifications.
To decode an abbreviated image, it is necessary to load the missing table(s)
into the decoder beforehand.  This can be accomplished by reading a separate
tables-only file.  A variant scheme uses a series of images in which the first
image is an interchange (complete) datastream, while subsequent ones are
abbreviated and rely on the tables loaded by the first image.  It is assumed
that once the decoder has read a table, it will remember that table until a
new definition for the same table number is encountered.

It is the application designer's responsibility to figure out how to associate
the correct tables with an abbreviated image.  While abbreviated datastreams
can be useful in a closed environment, their use is strongly discouraged in
any situation where data exchange with other applications might be needed.
Caveat designer.

The JPEG library provides support for reading and writing any combination of
tables-only datastreams and abbreviated images.  In both compression and
decompression objects, a quantization or Huffman table will be retained for
the lifetime of the object, unless it is overwritten by a new table definition.


To create abbreviated image datastreams, it is only necessary to tell the
compressor not to emit some or all of the tables it is using.  Each
quantization and Huffman table struct contains a boolean field "sent_table",
which normally is initialized to FALSE.  For each table used by the image, the
header-writing process emits the table and sets sent_table = TRUE unless it is
already TRUE.  (In normal usage, this prevents outputting the same table
definition multiple times, as would otherwise occur because the chroma
components typically share tables.)  Thus, setting this field to TRUE before
calling jpeg_start_compress() will prevent the table from being written at
all.

If you want to create a "pure" abbreviated image file containing no tables,
just call "jpeg_suppress_tables(&cinfo, TRUE)" after constructing all the
tables.  If you want to emit some but not all tables, you'll need to set the
individual sent_table fields directly.

To create an abbreviated image, you must also call jpeg_start_compress()
with a second parameter of FALSE, not TRUE.  Otherwise jpeg_start_compress()
will force all the sent_table fields to FALSE.  (This is a safety feature to
prevent abbreviated images from being created accidentally.)

To create a tables-only file, perform the same parameter setup that you
normally would, but instead of calling jpeg_start_compress() and so on, call
jpeg_write_tables(&cinfo).  This will write an abbreviated datastream
containing only SOI, DQT and/or DHT markers, and EOI.  All the quantization
and Huffman tables that are currently defined in the compression object will
be emitted unless their sent_tables flag is already TRUE, and then all the
sent_tables flags will be set TRUE.

A sure-fire way to create matching tables-only and abbreviated image files
is to proceed as follows:

	create JPEG compression object
	set JPEG parameters
	set destination to tables-only file
	jpeg_write_tables(&cinfo);
	set destination to image file
	jpeg_start_compress(&cinfo, FALSE);
	write data...
	jpeg_finish_compress(&cinfo);

Since the JPEG parameters are not altered between writing the table file and
the abbreviated image file, the same tables are sure to be used.  Of course,
you can repeat the jpeg_start_compress() ... jpeg_finish_compress() sequence
many times to produce many abbreviated image files matching the table file.

You cannot suppress output of the computed Huffman tables when Huffman
optimization is selected.  (If you could, there'd be no way to decode the
image...)  Generally, you don't want to set optimize_coding = TRUE when
you are trying to produce abbreviated files.

In some cases you might want to compress an image using tables which are
not stored in the application, but are defined in an interchange or
tables-only file readable by the application.  This can be done by setting up
a JPEG decompression object to read the specification file, then copying the
tables into your compression object.  See jpeg_copy_critical_parameters()
for an example of copying quantization tables.


To read abbreviated image files, you simply need to load the proper tables
into the decompression object before trying to read the abbreviated image.
If the proper tables are stored in the application program, you can just
allocate the table structs and fill in their contents directly.  For example,
to load a fixed quantization table into table slot "n":

    if (cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] == NULL)
      cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] = jpeg_alloc_quant_table((j_common_ptr) &cinfo);
    quant_ptr = cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n];	/* quant_ptr is JQUANT_TBL* */
    for (i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
      /* Qtable[] is desired quantization table, in natural array order */
      quant_ptr->quantval[i] = Qtable[i];
    }

Code to load a fixed Huffman table is typically (for AC table "n"):

    if (cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n] == NULL)
      cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n] = jpeg_alloc_huff_table((j_common_ptr) &cinfo);
    huff_ptr = cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n];	/* huff_ptr is JHUFF_TBL* */
    for (i = 1; i <= 16; i++) {
      /* counts[i] is number of Huffman codes of length i bits, i=1..16 */
      huff_ptr->bits[i] = counts[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
      /* symbols[] is the list of Huffman symbols, in code-length order */
      huff_ptr->huffval[i] = symbols[i];
    }

(Note that trying to set cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] to point directly at a
constant JQUANT_TBL object is not safe.  If the incoming file happened to
contain a quantization table definition, your master table would get
overwritten!  Instead allocate a working table copy and copy the master table
into it, as illustrated above.  Ditto for Huffman tables, of course.)

You might want to read the tables from a tables-only file, rather than
hard-wiring them into your application.  The jpeg_read_header() call is
sufficient to read a tables-only file.  You must pass a second parameter of
FALSE to indicate that you do not require an image to be present.  Thus, the
typical scenario is

	create JPEG decompression object
	set source to tables-only file
	jpeg_read_header(&cinfo, FALSE);
	set source to abbreviated image file
	jpeg_read_header(&cinfo, TRUE);
	set decompression parameters
	jpeg_start_decompress(&cinfo);
	read data...
	jpeg_finish_decompress(&cinfo);

In some cases, you may want to read a file without knowing whether it contains
an image or just tables.  In that case, pass FALSE and check the return value
from jpeg_read_header(): it will be JPEG_HEADER_OK if an image was found,
JPEG_HEADER_TABLES_ONLY if only tables were found.  (A third return value,
JPEG_SUSPENDED, is possible when using a suspending data source manager.)
Note that jpeg_read_header() will not complain if you read an abbreviated
image for which you haven't loaded the missing tables; the missing-table check
occurs later, in jpeg_start_decompress().


It is possible to read a series of images from a single source file by
repeating the jpeg_read_header() ... jpeg_finish_decompress() sequence,
without releasing/recreating the JPEG object or the data source module.
(If you did reinitialize, any partial bufferload left in the data source
buffer at the end of one image would be discarded, causing you to lose the
start of the next image.)  When you use this method, stored tables are
automatically carried forward, so some of the images can be abbreviated images
that depend on tables from earlier images.

If you intend to write a series of images into a single destination file,
you might want to make a specialized data destination module that doesn't
flush the output buffer at term_destination() time.  This would speed things
up by some trifling amount.  Of course, you'd need to remember to flush the
buffer after the last image.  You can make the later images be abbreviated
ones by passing FALSE to jpeg_start_compress().


Special markers
---------------

Some applications may need to insert or extract special data in the JPEG
datastream.  The JPEG standard provides marker types "COM" (comment) and
"APP0" through "APP15" (application) to hold application-specific data.
Unfortunately, the use of these markers is not specified by the standard.
COM markers are fairly widely used to hold user-supplied text.  The JFIF file
format spec uses APP0 markers with specified initial strings to hold certain
data.  Adobe applications use APP14 markers beginning with the string "Adobe"
for miscellaneous data.  Other APPn markers are rarely seen, but might
contain almost anything.

If you wish to store user-supplied text, we recommend you use COM markers
and place readable 7-bit ASCII text in them.  Newline conventions are not
standardized --- expect to find LF (Unix style), CR/LF (DOS style), or CR
(Mac style).  A robust COM reader should be able to cope with random binary
garbage, including nulls, since some applications generate COM markers
containing non-ASCII junk.  (But yours should not be one of them.)

For program-supplied data, use an APPn marker, and be sure to begin it with an
identifying string so that you can tell whether the marker is actually yours.
It's probably best to avoid using APP0 or APP14 for any private markers.
(NOTE: the upcoming SPIFF standard will use APP8 markers; we recommend you
not use APP8 markers for any private purposes, either.)

Keep in mind that at most 65533 bytes can be put into one marker, but you
can have as many markers as you like.

By default, the IJG compression library will write a JFIF APP0 marker if the
selected JPEG colorspace is grayscale or YCbCr, or an Adobe APP14 marker if
the selected colorspace is RGB, CMYK, or YCCK.  You can disable this, but
we don't recommend it.  The decompression library will recognize JFIF and
Adobe markers and will set the JPEG colorspace properly when one is found.


You can write special markers immediately following the datastream header by
calling jpeg_write_marker() after jpeg_start_compress() and before the first
call to jpeg_write_scanlines().  When you do this, the markers appear after
the SOI and the JFIF APP0 and Adobe APP14 markers (if written), but before
all else.  Specify the marker type parameter as "JPEG_COM" for COM or
"JPEG_APP0 + n" for APPn.  (Actually, jpeg_write_marker will let you write
any marker type, but we don't recommend writing any other kinds of marker.)
For example, to write a user comment string pointed to by comment_text:
	jpeg_write_marker(cinfo, JPEG_COM, comment_text, strlen(comment_text));

If it's not convenient to store all the marker data in memory at once,
you can instead call jpeg_write_m_header() followed by multiple calls to
jpeg_write_m_byte().  If you do it this way, it's your responsibility to
call jpeg_write_m_byte() exactly the number of times given in the length
parameter to jpeg_write_m_header().  (This method lets you empty the
output buffer partway through a marker, which might be important when
using a suspending data destination module.  In any case, if you are using
a suspending destination, you should flush its buffer after inserting
any special markers.  See "I/O suspension".)

Or, if you prefer to synthesize the marker byte sequence yourself,
you can just cram it straight into the data destination module.

If you are writing JFIF 1.02 extension markers (thumbnail images), don't
forget to set cinfo.JFIF_minor_version = 2 so that the encoder will write the
correct JFIF version number in the JFIF header marker.  The library's default
is to write version 1.01, but that's wrong if you insert any 1.02 extension
markers.  (We could probably get away with just defaulting to 1.02, but there
used to be broken decoders that would complain about unknown minor version
numbers.  To reduce compatibility risks it's safest not to write 1.02 unless
you are actually using 1.02 extensions.)


When reading, two methods of handling special markers are available:
1. You can ask the library to save the contents of COM and/or APPn markers
into memory, and then examine them at your leisure afterwards.
2. You can supply your own routine to process COM and/or APPn markers
on-the-fly as they are read.
The first method is simpler to use, especially if you are using a suspending
data source; writing a marker processor that copes with input suspension is
not easy (consider what happens if the marker is longer than your available
input buffer).  However, the second method conserves memory since the marker
data need not be kept around after it's been processed.

For either method, you'd normally set up marker handling after creating a
decompression object and before calling jpeg_read_header(), because the
markers of interest will typically be near the head of the file and so will
be scanned by jpeg_read_header.  Once you've established a marker handling
method, it will be used for the life of that decompression object
(potentially many datastreams), unless you change it.  Marker handling is
determined separately for COM markers and for each APPn marker code.


To save the contents of special markers in memory, call
	jpeg_save_markers(cinfo, marker_code, length_limit)
where marker_code is the marker type to save, JPEG_COM or JPEG_APP0+n.
(To arrange to save all the special marker types, you need to call this
routine 17 times, for COM and APP0-APP15.)  If the incoming marker is longer
than length_limit data bytes, only length_limit bytes will be saved; this
parameter allows you to avoid chewing up memory when you only need to see the
first few bytes of a potentially large marker.  If you want to save all the
data, set length_limit to 0xFFFF; that is enough since marker lengths are only
16 bits.  As a special case, setting length_limit to 0 prevents that marker
type from being saved at all.  (That is the default behavior, in fact.)

After jpeg_read_header() completes, you can examine the special markers by
following the cinfo->marker_list pointer chain.  All the special markers in
the file appear in this list, in order of their occurrence in the file (but
omitting any markers of types you didn't ask for).  Both the original data
length and the saved data length are recorded for each list entry; the latter
will not exceed length_limit for the particular marker type.  Note that these
lengths exclude the marker length word, whereas the stored representation
within the JPEG file includes it.  (Hence the maximum data length is really
only 65533.)

It is possible that additional special markers appear in the file beyond the
SOS marker at which jpeg_read_header stops; if so, the marker list will be
extended during reading of the rest of the file.  This is not expected to be
common, however.  If you are short on memory you may want to reset the length
limit to zero for all marker types after finishing jpeg_read_header, to
ensure that the max_memory_to_use setting cannot be exceeded due to addition
of later markers.

The marker list remains stored until you call jpeg_finish_decompress or
jpeg_abort, at which point the memory is freed and the list is set to empty.
(jpeg_destroy also releases the storage, of course.)

Note that the library is internally interested in APP0 and APP14 markers;
if you try to set a small nonzero length limit on these types, the library
will silently force the length up to the minimum it wants.  (But you can set
a zero length limit to prevent them from being saved at all.)  Also, in a
16-bit environment, the maximum length limit may be constrained to less than
65533 by malloc() limitations.  It is therefore best not to assume that the
effective length limit is exactly what you set it to be.


If you want to supply your own marker-reading routine, you do it by calling
jpeg_set_marker_processor().  A marker processor routine must have the
signature
	boolean jpeg_marker_parser_method (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)
Although the marker code is not explicitly passed, the routine can find it
in cinfo->unread_marker.  At the time of call, the marker proper has been
read from the data source module.  The processor routine is responsible for
reading the marker length word and the remaining parameter bytes, if any.
Return TRUE to indicate success.  (FALSE should be returned only if you are
using a suspending data source and it tells you to suspend.  See the standard
marker processors in jdmarker.c for appropriate coding methods if you need to
use a suspending data source.)

If you override the default APP0 or APP14 processors, it is up to you to
recognize JFIF and Adobe markers if you want colorspace recognition to occur
properly.  We recommend copying and extending the default processors if you
want to do that.  (A better idea is to save these marker types for later
examination by calling jpeg_save_markers(); that method doesn't interfere
with the library's own processing of these markers.)

jpeg_set_marker_processor() and jpeg_save_markers() are mutually exclusive
--- if you call one it overrides any previous call to the other, for the
particular marker type specified.

A simple example of an external COM processor can be found in djpeg.c.
Also, see jpegtran.c for an example of using jpeg_save_markers.


Raw (downsampled) image data
----------------------------

Some applications need to supply already-downsampled image data to the JPEG
compressor, or to receive raw downsampled data from the decompressor.  The
library supports this requirement by allowing the application to write or
read raw data, bypassing the normal preprocessing or postprocessing steps.
The interface is different from the standard one and is somewhat harder to
use.  If your interest is merely in bypassing color conversion, we recommend
that you use the standard interface and simply set jpeg_color_space =
in_color_space (or jpeg_color_space = out_color_space for decompression).
The mechanism described in this section is necessary only to supply or
receive downsampled image data, in which not all components have the same
dimensions.


To compress raw data, you must supply the data in the colorspace to be used
in the JPEG file (please read the earlier section on Special color spaces)
and downsampled to the sampling factors specified in the JPEG parameters.
You must supply the data in the format used internally by the JPEG library,
namely a JSAMPIMAGE array.  This is an array of pointers to two-dimensional
arrays, each of type JSAMPARRAY.  Each 2-D array holds the values for one
color component.  This structure is necessary since the components are of
different sizes.  If the image dimensions are not a multiple of the MCU size,
you must also pad the data correctly (usually, this is done by replicating
the last column and/or row).  The data must be padded to a multiple of a DCT
block in each component: that is, each downsampled row must contain a
multiple of 8 valid samples, and there must be a multiple of 8 sample rows
for each component.  (For applications such as conversion of digital TV
images, the standard image size is usually a multiple of the DCT block size,
so that no padding need actually be done.)

The procedure for compression of raw data is basically the same as normal
compression, except that you call jpeg_write_raw_data() in place of
jpeg_write_scanlines().  Before calling jpeg_start_compress(), you must do
the following:
  * Set cinfo->raw_data_in to TRUE.  (It is set FALSE by jpeg_set_defaults().)
    This notifies the library that you will be supplying raw data.
  * Ensure jpeg_color_space is correct --- an explicit jpeg_set_colorspace()
    call is a good idea.  Note that since color conversion is bypassed,
    in_color_space is ignored, except that jpeg_set_defaults() uses it to
    choose the default jpeg_color_space setting.
  * Ensure the sampling factors, cinfo->comp_info[i].h_samp_factor and
    cinfo->comp_info[i].v_samp_factor, are correct.  Since these indicate the
    dimensions of the data you are supplying, it's wise to set them
    explicitly, rather than assuming the library's defaults are what you want.

To pass raw data to the library, call jpeg_write_raw_data() in place of
jpeg_write_scanlines().  The two routines work similarly except that
jpeg_write_raw_data takes a JSAMPIMAGE data array rather than JSAMPARRAY.
The scanlines count passed to and returned from jpeg_write_raw_data is
measured in terms of the component with the largest v_samp_factor.

jpeg_write_raw_data() processes one MCU row per call, which is to say
v_samp_factor*DCTSIZE sample rows of each component.  The passed num_lines
value must be at least max_v_samp_factor*DCTSIZE, and the return value will
be exactly that amount (or possibly some multiple of that amount, in future
library versions).  This is true even on the last call at the bottom of the
image; don't forget to pad your data as necessary.

The required dimensions of the supplied data can be computed for each
component as
	cinfo->comp_info[i].width_in_blocks*DCTSIZE  samples per row
	cinfo->comp_info[i].height_in_blocks*DCTSIZE rows in image
after jpeg_start_compress() has initialized those fields.  If the valid data
is smaller than this, it must be padded appropriately.  For some sampling
factors and image sizes, additional dummy DCT blocks are inserted to make
the image a multiple of the MCU dimensions.  The library creates such dummy
blocks itself; it does not read them from your supplied data.  Therefore you
need never pad by more than DCTSIZE samples.  An example may help here.
Assume 2h2v downsampling of YCbCr data, that is
	cinfo->comp_info[0].h_samp_factor = 2		for Y
	cinfo->comp_info[0].v_samp_factor = 2
	cinfo->comp_info[1].h_samp_factor = 1		for Cb
	cinfo->comp_info[1].v_samp_factor = 1
	cinfo->comp_info[2].h_samp_factor = 1		for Cr
	cinfo->comp_info[2].v_samp_factor = 1
and suppose that the nominal image dimensions (cinfo->image_width and
cinfo->image_height) are 101x101 pixels.  Then jpeg_start_compress() will
compute downsampled_width = 101 and width_in_blocks = 13 for Y,
downsampled_width = 51 and width_in_blocks = 7 for Cb and Cr (and the same
for the height fields).  You must pad the Y data to at least 13*8 = 104
columns and rows, the Cb/Cr data to at least 7*8 = 56 columns and rows.  The
MCU height is max_v_samp_factor = 2 DCT rows so you must pass at least 16
scanlines on each call to jpeg_write_raw_data(), which is to say 16 actual
sample rows of Y and 8 each of Cb and Cr.  A total of 7 MCU rows are needed,
so you must pass a total of 7*16 = 112 "scanlines".  The last DCT block row
of Y data is dummy, so it doesn't matter what you pass for it in the data
arrays, but the scanlines count must total up to 112 so that all of the Cb
and Cr data gets passed.

Output suspension is supported with raw-data compression: if the data
destination module suspends, jpeg_write_raw_data() will return 0.
In this case the same data rows must be passed again on the next call.


Decompression with raw data output implies bypassing all postprocessing:
you cannot ask for rescaling or color quantization, for instance.  More
seriously, you must deal with the color space and sampling factors present in
the incoming file.  If your application only handles, say, 2h1v YCbCr data,
you must check for and fail on other color spaces or other sampling factors.
The library will not convert to a different color space for you.

To obtain raw data output, set cinfo->raw_data_out = TRUE before
jpeg_start_decompress() (it is set FALSE by jpeg_read_header()).  Be sure to
verify that the color space and sampling factors are ones you can handle.
Then call jpeg_read_raw_data() in place of jpeg_read_scanlines().  The
decompression process is otherwise the same as usual.

jpeg_read_raw_data() returns one MCU row per call, and thus you must pass a
buffer of at least max_v_samp_factor*DCTSIZE scanlines (scanline counting is
the same as for raw-data compression).  The buffer you pass must be large
enough to hold the actual data plus padding to DCT-block boundaries.  As with
compression, any entirely dummy DCT blocks are not processed so you need not
allocate space for them, but the total scanline count includes them.  The
above example of computing buffer dimensions for raw-data compression is
equally valid for decompression.

Input suspension is supported with raw-data decompression: if the data source
module suspends, jpeg_read_raw_data() will return 0.  You can also use
buffered-image mode to read raw data in multiple passes.


Really raw data: DCT coefficients
---------------------------------

It is possible to read or write the contents of a JPEG file as raw DCT
coefficients.  This facility is mainly intended for use in lossless
transcoding between different JPEG file formats.  Other possible applications
include lossless cropping of a JPEG image, lossless reassembly of a
multi-strip or multi-tile TIFF/JPEG file into a single JPEG datastream, etc.

To read the contents of a JPEG file as DCT coefficients, open the file and do
jpeg_read_header() as usual.  But instead of calling jpeg_start_decompress()
and jpeg_read_scanlines(), call jpeg_read_coefficients().  This will read the
entire image into a set of virtual coefficient-block arrays, one array per
component.  The return value is a pointer to an array of virtual-array
descriptors.  Each virtual array can be accessed directly using the JPEG
memory manager's access_virt_barray method (see Memory management, below,
and also read structure.doc's discussion of virtual array handling).  Or,
for simple transcoding to a different JPEG file format, the array list can
just be handed directly to jpeg_write_coefficients().

Each block in the block arrays contains quantized coefficient values in
normal array order (not JPEG zigzag order).  The block arrays contain only
DCT blocks containing real data; any entirely-dummy blocks added to fill out
interleaved MCUs at the right or bottom edges of the image are discarded
during reading and are not stored in the block arrays.  (The size of each
block array can be determined from the width_in_blocks and height_in_blocks
fields of the component's comp_info entry.)  This is also the data format
expected by jpeg_write_coefficients().

When you are done using the virtual arrays, call jpeg_finish_decompress()
to release the array storage and return the decompression object to an idle
state; or just call jpeg_destroy() if you don't need to reuse the object.

If you use a suspending data source, jpeg_read_coefficients() will return
NULL if it is forced to suspend; a non-NULL return value indicates successful
completion.  You need not test for a NULL return value when using a
non-suspending data source.

It is also possible to call jpeg_read_coefficients() to obtain access to the
decoder's coefficient arrays during a normal decode cycle in buffered-image
mode.  This frammish might be useful for progressively displaying an incoming
image and then re-encoding it without loss.  To do this, decode in buffered-
image mode as discussed previously, then call jpeg_read_coefficients() after
the last jpeg_finish_output() call.  The arrays will be available for your use
until you call jpeg_finish_decompress().


To write the contents of a JPEG file as DCT coefficients, you must provide
the DCT coefficients stored in virtual block arrays.  You can either pass
block arrays read from an input JPEG file by jpeg_read_coefficients(), or
allocate virtual arrays from the JPEG compression object and fill them
yourself.  In either case, jpeg_write_coefficients() is substituted for
jpeg_start_compress() and jpeg_write_scanlines().  Thus the sequence is
  * Create compression object
  * Set all compression parameters as necessary
  * Request virtual arrays if needed
  * jpeg_write_coefficients()
  * jpeg_finish_compress()
  * Destroy or re-use compression object
jpeg_write_coefficients() is passed a pointer to an array of virtual block
array descriptors; the number of arrays is equal to cinfo.num_components.

The virtual arrays need only have been requested, not realized, before
jpeg_write_coefficients() is called.  A side-effect of
jpeg_write_coefficients() is to realize any virtual arrays that have been
requested from the compression object's memory manager.  Thus, when obtaining
the virtual arrays from the compression object, you should fill the arrays
after calling jpeg_write_coefficients().  The data is actually written out
when you call jpeg_finish_compress(); jpeg_write_coefficients() only writes
the file header.

When writing raw DCT coefficients, it is crucial that the JPEG quantization
tables and sampling factors match the way the data was encoded, or the
resulting file will be invalid.  For transcoding from an existing JPEG file,
we recommend using jpeg_copy_critical_parameters().  This routine initializes
all the compression parameters to default values (like jpeg_set_defaults()),
then copies the critical information from a source decompression object.
The decompression object should have just been used to read the entire
JPEG input file --- that is, it should be awaiting jpeg_finish_decompress().

jpeg_write_coefficients() marks all tables stored in the compression object
as needing to be written to the output file (thus, it acts like
jpeg_start_compress(cinfo, TRUE)).  This is for safety's sake, to avoid
emitting abbreviated JPEG files by accident.  If you really want to emit an
abbreviated JPEG file, call jpeg_suppress_tables(), or set the tables'
individual sent_table flags, between calling jpeg_write_coefficients() and
jpeg_finish_compress().


Progress monitoring
-------------------

Some applications may need to regain control from the JPEG library every so
often.  The typical use of this feature is to produce a percent-done bar or
other progress display.  (For a simple example, see cjpeg.c or djpeg.c.)
Although you do get control back frequently during the data-transferring pass
(the jpeg_read_scanlines or jpeg_write_scanlines loop), any additional passes
will occur inside jpeg_finish_compress or jpeg_start_decompress; those
routines may take a long time to execute, and you don't get control back
until they are done.

You can define a progress-monitor routine which will be called periodically
by the library.  No guarantees are made about how often this call will occur,
so we don't recommend you use it for mouse tracking or anything like that.
At present, a call will occur once per MCU row, scanline, or sample row
group, whichever unit is convenient for the current processing mode; so the
wider the image, the longer the time between calls.  During the data
transferring pass, only one call occurs per call of jpeg_read_scanlines or
jpeg_write_scanlines, so don't pass a large number of scanlines at once if
you want fine resolution in the progress count.  (If you really need to use
the callback mechanism for time-critical tasks like mouse tracking, you could
insert additional calls inside some of the library's inner loops.)

To establish a progress-monitor callback, create a struct jpeg_progress_mgr,
fill in its progress_monitor field with a pointer to your callback routine,
and set cinfo->progress to point to the struct.  The callback will be called
whenever cinfo->progress is non-NULL.  (This pointer is set to NULL by
jpeg_create_compress or jpeg_create_decompress; the library will not change
it thereafter.  So if you allocate dynamic storage for the progress struct,
make sure it will live as long as the JPEG object does.  Allocating from the
JPEG memory manager with lifetime JPOOL_PERMANENT will work nicely.)  You
can use the same callback routine for both compression and decompression.

The jpeg_progress_mgr struct contains four fields which are set by the library:
	long pass_counter;	/* work units completed in this pass */
	long pass_limit;	/* total number of work units in this pass */
	int completed_passes;	/* passes completed so far */
	int total_passes;	/* total number of passes expected */
During any one pass, pass_counter increases from 0 up to (not including)
pass_limit; the step size is usually but not necessarily 1.  The pass_limit
value may change from one pass to another.  The expected total number of
passes is in total_passes, and the number of passes already completed is in
completed_passes.  Thus the fraction of work completed may be estimated as
		completed_passes + (pass_counter/pass_limit)
		--------------------------------------------
				total_passes
ignoring the fact that the passes may not be equal amounts of work.

When decompressing, pass_limit can even change within a pass, because it
depends on the number of scans in the JPEG file, which isn't always known in
advance.  The computed fraction-of-work-done may jump suddenly (if the library
discovers it has overestimated the number of scans) or even decrease (in the
opposite case).  It is not wise to put great faith in the work estimate.

When using the decompressor's buffered-image mode, the progress monitor work
estimate is likely to be completely unhelpful, because the library has no way
to know how many output passes will be demanded of it.  Currently, the library
sets total_passes based on the assumption that there will be one more output
pass if the input file end hasn't yet been read (jpeg_input_complete() isn't
TRUE), but no more output passes if the file end has been reached when the
output pass is started.  This means that total_passes will rise as additional
output passes are requested.  If you have a way of determining the input file
size, estimating progress based on the fraction of the file that's been read
will probably be more useful than using the library's value.


Memory management
-----------------

This section covers some key facts about the JPEG library's built-in memory
manager.  For more info, please read structure.doc's section about the memory
manager, and consult the source code if necessary.

All memory and temporary file allocation within the library is done via the
memory manager.  If necessary, you can replace the "back end" of the memory
manager to control allocation yourself (for example, if you don't want the
library to use malloc() and free() for some reason).

Some data is allocated "permanently" and will not be freed until the JPEG
object is destroyed.  Most data is allocated "per image" and is freed by
jpeg_finish_compress, jpeg_finish_decompress, or jpeg_abort.  You can call the
memory manager yourself to allocate structures that will automatically be
freed at these times.  Typical code for this is
  ptr = (*cinfo->mem->alloc_small) ((j_common_ptr) cinfo, JPOOL_IMAGE, size);
Use JPOOL_PERMANENT to get storage that lasts as long as the JPEG object.
Use alloc_large instead of alloc_small for anything bigger than a few Kbytes.
There are also alloc_sarray and alloc_barray routines that automatically
build 2-D sample or block arrays.

The library's minimum space requirements to process an image depend on the
image's width, but not on its height, because the library ordinarily works
with "strip" buffers that are as wide as the image but just a few rows high.
Some operating modes (eg, two-pass color quantization) require full-image
buffers.  Such buffers are treated as "virtual arrays": only the current strip
need be in memory, and the rest can be swapped out to a temporary file.

If you use the simplest memory manager back end (jmemnobs.c), then no
temporary files are used; virtual arrays are simply malloc()'d.  Images bigger
than memory can be processed only if your system supports virtual memory.
The other memory manager back ends support temporary files of various flavors
and thus work in machines without virtual memory.  They may also be useful on
Unix machines if you need to process images that exceed available swap space.

When using temporary files, the library will make the in-memory buffers for
its virtual arrays just big enough to stay within a "maximum memory" setting.
Your application can set this limit by setting cinfo->mem->max_memory_to_use
after creating the JPEG object.  (Of course, there is still a minimum size for
the buffers, so the max-memory setting is effective only if it is bigger than
the minimum space needed.)  If you allocate any large structures yourself, you
must allocate them before jpeg_start_compress() or jpeg_start_decompress() in
order to have them counted against the max memory limit.  Also keep in mind
that space allocated with alloc_small() is ignored, on the assumption that
it's too small to be worth worrying about; so a reasonable safety margin
should be left when setting max_memory_to_use.

If you use the jmemname.c or jmemdos.c memory manager back end, it is
important to clean up the JPEG object properly to ensure that the temporary
files get deleted.  (This is especially crucial with jmemdos.c, where the
"temporary files" may be extended-memory segments; if they are not freed,
DOS will require a reboot to recover the memory.)  Thus, with these memory
managers, it's a good idea to provide a signal handler that will trap any
early exit from your program.  The handler should call either jpeg_abort()
or jpeg_destroy() for any active JPEG objects.  A handler is not needed with
jmemnobs.c, and shouldn't be necessary with jmemansi.c or jmemmac.c either,
since the C library is supposed to take care of deleting files made with
tmpfile().


Memory usage
------------

Working memory requirements while performing compression or decompression
depend on image dimensions, image characteristics (such as colorspace and
JPEG process), and operating mode (application-selected options).

As of v6b, the decompressor requires:
 1. About 24K in more-or-less-fixed-size data.  This varies a bit depending
    on operating mode and image characteristics (particularly color vs.
    grayscale), but it doesn't depend on image dimensions.
 2. Strip buffers (of size proportional to the image width) for IDCT and
    upsampling results.  The worst case for commonly used sampling factors
    is about 34 bytes * width in pixels for a color image.  A grayscale image
    only needs about 8 bytes per pixel column.
 3. A full-image DCT coefficient buffer is needed to decode a multi-scan JPEG
    file (including progressive JPEGs), or whenever you select buffered-image
    mode.  This takes 2 bytes/coefficient.  At typical 2x2 sampling, that's
    3 bytes per pixel for a color image.  Worst case (1x1 sampling) requires
    6 bytes/pixel.  For grayscale, figure 2 bytes/pixel.
 4. To perform 2-pass color quantization, the decompressor also needs a
    128K color lookup table and a full-image pixel buffer (3 bytes/pixel).
This does not count any memory allocated by the application, such as a
buffer to hold the final output image.

The above figures are valid for 8-bit JPEG data precision and a machine with
32-bit ints.  For 12-bit JPEG data, double the size of the strip buffers and
quantization pixel buffer.  The "fixed-size" data will be somewhat smaller
with 16-bit ints, larger with 64-bit ints.  Also, CMYK or other unusual
color spaces will require different amounts of space.

The full-image coefficient and pixel buffers, if needed at all, do not
have to be fully RAM resident; you can have the library use temporary
files instead when the total memory usage would exceed a limit you set.
(But if your OS supports virtual memory, it's probably better to just use
jmemnobs and let the OS do the swapping.)

The compressor's memory requirements are similar, except that it has no need
for color quantization.  Also, it needs a full-image DCT coefficient buffer
if Huffman-table optimization is asked for, even if progressive mode is not
requested.

If you need more detailed information about memory usage in a particular
situation, you can enable the MEM_STATS code in jmemmgr.c.


Library compile-time options
----------------------------

A number of compile-time options are available by modifying jmorecfg.h.

The JPEG standard provides for both the baseline 8-bit DCT process and
a 12-bit DCT process.  The IJG code supports 12-bit lossy JPEG if you define
BITS_IN_JSAMPLE as 12 rather than 8.  Note that this causes JSAMPLE to be
larger than a char, so it affects the surrounding application's image data.
The sample applications cjpeg and djpeg can support 12-bit mode only for PPM
and GIF file formats; you must disable the other file formats to compile a
12-bit cjpeg or djpeg.  (install.doc has more information about that.)
At present, a 12-bit library can handle *only* 12-bit images, not both
precisions.  (If you need to include both 8- and 12-bit libraries in a single
application, you could probably do it by defining NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES
for just one of the copies.  You'd have to access the 8-bit and 12-bit copies
from separate application source files.  This is untested ... if you try it,
we'd like to hear whether it works!)

Note that a 12-bit library always compresses in Huffman optimization mode,
in order to generate valid Huffman tables.  This is necessary because our
default Huffman tables only cover 8-bit data.  If you need to output 12-bit
files in one pass, you'll have to supply suitable default Huffman tables.
You may also want to supply your own DCT quantization tables; the existing
quality-scaling code has been developed for 8-bit use, and probably doesn't
generate especially good tables for 12-bit.

The maximum number of components (color channels) in the image is determined
by MAX_COMPONENTS.  The JPEG standard allows up to 255 components, but we
expect that few applications will need more than four or so.

On machines with unusual data type sizes, you may be able to improve
performance or reduce memory space by tweaking the various typedefs in
jmorecfg.h.  In particular, on some RISC CPUs, access to arrays of "short"s
is quite slow; consider trading memory for speed by making JCOEF, INT16, and
UINT16 be "int" or "unsigned int".  UINT8 is also a candidate to become int.
You probably don't want to make JSAMPLE be int unless you have lots of memory
to burn.

You can reduce the size of the library by compiling out various optional
functions.  To do this, undefine xxx_SUPPORTED symbols as necessary.

You can also save a few K by not having text error messages in the library;
the standard error message table occupies about 5Kb.  This is particularly
reasonable for embedded applications where there's no good way to display 
a message anyway.  To do this, remove the creation of the message table
(jpeg_std_message_table[]) from jerror.c, and alter format_message to do
something reasonable without it.  You could output the numeric value of the
message code number, for example.  If you do this, you can also save a couple
more K by modifying the TRACEMSn() macros in jerror.h to expand to nothing;
you don't need trace capability anyway, right?


Portability considerations
--------------------------

The JPEG library has been written to be extremely portable; the sample
applications cjpeg and djpeg are slightly less so.  This section summarizes
the design goals in this area.  (If you encounter any bugs that cause the
library to be less portable than is claimed here, we'd appreciate hearing
about them.)

The code works fine on ANSI C, C++, and pre-ANSI C compilers, using any of
the popular system include file setups, and some not-so-popular ones too.
See install.doc for configuration procedures.

The code is not dependent on the exact sizes of the C data types.  As
distributed, we make the assumptions that
	char	is at least 8 bits wide
	short	is at least 16 bits wide
	int	is at least 16 bits wide
	long	is at least 32 bits wide
(These are the minimum requirements of the ANSI C standard.)  Wider types will
work fine, although memory may be used inefficiently if char is much larger
than 8 bits or short is much bigger than 16 bits.  The code should work
equally well with 16- or 32-bit ints.

In a system where these assumptions are not met, you may be able to make the
code work by modifying the typedefs in jmorecfg.h.  However, you will probably
have difficulty if int is less than 16 bits wide, since references to plain
int abound in the code.

char can be either signed or unsigned, although the code runs faster if an
unsigned char type is available.  If char is wider than 8 bits, you will need
to redefine JOCTET and/or provide custom data source/destination managers so
that JOCTET represents exactly 8 bits of data on external storage.

The JPEG library proper does not assume ASCII representation of characters.
But some of the image file I/O modules in cjpeg/djpeg do have ASCII
dependencies in file-header manipulation; so does cjpeg's select_file_type()
routine.

The JPEG library does not rely heavily on the C library.  In particular, C
stdio is used only by the data source/destination modules and the error
handler, all of which are application-replaceable.  (cjpeg/djpeg are more
heavily dependent on stdio.)  malloc and free are called only from the memory
manager "back end" module, so you can use a different memory allocator by
replacing that one file.

The code generally assumes that C names must be unique in the first 15
characters.  However, global function names can be made unique in the
first 6 characters by defining NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES.

More info about porting the code may be gleaned by reading jconfig.doc,
jmorecfg.h, and jinclude.h.


Notes for MS-DOS implementors
-----------------------------

The IJG code is designed to work efficiently in 80x86 "small" or "medium"
memory models (i.e., data pointers are 16 bits unless explicitly declared
"far"; code pointers can be either size).  You may be able to use small
model to compile cjpeg or djpeg by itself, but you will probably have to use
medium model for any larger application.  This won't make much difference in
performance.  You *will* take a noticeable performance hit if you use a
large-data memory model (perhaps 10%-25%), and you should avoid "huge" model
if at all possible.

The JPEG library typically needs 2Kb-3Kb of stack space.  It will also
malloc about 20K-30K of near heap space while executing (and lots of far
heap, but that doesn't count in this calculation).  This figure will vary
depending on selected operating mode, and to a lesser extent on image size.
There is also about 5Kb-6Kb of constant data which will be allocated in the
near data segment (about 4Kb of this is the error message table).
Thus you have perhaps 20K available for other modules' static data and near
heap space before you need to go to a larger memory model.  The C library's
static data will account for several K of this, but that still leaves a good
deal for your needs.  (If you are tight on space, you could reduce the sizes
of the I/O buffers allocated by jdatasrc.c and jdatadst.c, say from 4K to
1K.  Another possibility is to move the error message table to far memory;
this should be doable with only localized hacking on jerror.c.)

About 2K of the near heap space is "permanent" memory that will not be
released until you destroy the JPEG object.  This is only an issue if you
save a JPEG object between compression or decompression operations.

Far data space may also be a tight resource when you are dealing with large
images.  The most memory-intensive case is decompression with two-pass color
quantization, or single-pass quantization to an externally supplied color
map.  This requires a 128Kb color lookup table plus strip buffers amounting
to about 40 bytes per column for typical sampling ratios (eg, about 25600
bytes for a 640-pixel-wide image).  You may not be able to process wide
images if you have large data structures of your own.

Of course, all of these concerns vanish if you use a 32-bit flat-memory-model
compiler, such as DJGPP or Watcom C.  We highly recommend flat model if you
can use it; the JPEG library is significantly faster in flat model.

Advanced usage instructions for the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software
==========================================================================

This file describes cjpeg's "switches for wizards".

The "wizard" switches are intended for experimentation with JPEG by persons
who are reasonably knowledgeable about the JPEG standard.  If you don't know
what you are doing, DON'T USE THESE SWITCHES.  You'll likely produce files
with worse image quality and/or poorer compression than you'd get from the
default settings.  Furthermore, these switches must be used with caution
when making files intended for general use, because not all JPEG decoders
will support unusual JPEG parameter settings.


Quantization Table Adjustment
-----------------------------

Ordinarily, cjpeg starts with a default set of tables (the same ones given
as examples in the JPEG standard) and scales them up or down according to
the -quality setting.  The details of the scaling algorithm can be found in
jcparam.c.  At very low quality settings, some quantization table entries
can get scaled up to values exceeding 255.  Although 2-byte quantization
values are supported by the IJG software, this feature is not in baseline
JPEG and is not supported by all implementations.  If you need to ensure
wide compatibility of low-quality files, you can constrain the scaled
quantization values to no more than 255 by giving the -baseline switch.
Note that use of -baseline will result in poorer quality for the same file
size, since more bits than necessary are expended on higher AC coefficients.

You can substitute a different set of quantization values by using the
-qtables switch:

	-qtables file	Use the quantization tables given in the named file.

The specified file should be a text file containing decimal quantization
values.  The file should contain one to four tables, each of 64 elements.
The tables are implicitly numbered 0,1,etc. in order of appearance.  Table
entries appear in normal array order (NOT in the zigzag order in which they
will be stored in the JPEG file).

Quantization table files are free format, in that arbitrary whitespace can
appear between numbers.  Also, comments can be included: a comment starts
with '#' and extends to the end of the line.  Here is an example file that
duplicates the default quantization tables:

	# Quantization tables given in JPEG spec, section K.1

	# This is table 0 (the luminance table):
	  16  11  10  16  24  40  51  61
	  12  12  14  19  26  58  60  55
	  14  13  16  24  40  57  69  56
	  14  17  22  29  51  87  80  62
	  18  22  37  56  68 109 103  77
	  24  35  55  64  81 104 113  92
	  49  64  78  87 103 121 120 101
	  72  92  95  98 112 100 103  99

	# This is table 1 (the chrominance table):
	  17  18  24  47  99  99  99  99
	  18  21  26  66  99  99  99  99
	  24  26  56  99  99  99  99  99
	  47  66  99  99  99  99  99  99
	  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  99
	  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  99
	  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  99
	  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  99

If the -qtables switch is used without -quality, then the specified tables
are used exactly as-is.  If both -qtables and -quality are used, then the
tables taken from the file are scaled in the same fashion that the default
tables would be scaled for that quality setting.  If -baseline appears, then
the quantization values are constrained to the range 1-255.

By default, cjpeg will use quantization table 0 for luminance components and
table 1 for chrominance components.  To override this choice, use the -qslots
switch:

	-qslots N[,...]		Select which quantization table to use for
				each color component.

The -qslots switch specifies a quantization table number for each color
component, in the order in which the components appear in the JPEG SOF marker.
For example, to create a separate table for each of Y,Cb,Cr, you could
provide a -qtables file that defines three quantization tables and say
"-qslots 0,1,2".  If -qslots gives fewer table numbers than there are color
components, then the last table number is repeated as necessary.


Sampling Factor Adjustment
--------------------------

By default, cjpeg uses 2:1 horizontal and vertical downsampling when
compressing YCbCr data, and no downsampling for all other color spaces.
You can override this default with the -sample switch:

	-sample HxV[,...]	Set JPEG sampling factors for each color
				component.

The -sample switch specifies the JPEG sampling factors for each color
component, in the order in which they appear in the JPEG SOF marker.
If you specify fewer HxV pairs than there are components, the remaining
components are set to 1x1 sampling.  For example, the default YCbCr setting
is equivalent to "-sample 2x2,1x1,1x1", which can be abbreviated to
"-sample 2x2".

There are still some JPEG decoders in existence that support only 2x1
sampling (also called 4:2:2 sampling).  Compatibility with such decoders can
be achieved by specifying "-sample 2x1".  This is not recommended unless
really necessary, since it increases file size and encoding/decoding time
with very little quality gain.


Multiple Scan / Progression Control
-----------------------------------

By default, cjpeg emits a single-scan sequential JPEG file.  The
-progressive switch generates a progressive JPEG file using a default series
of progression parameters.  You can create multiple-scan sequential JPEG
files or progressive JPEG files with custom progression parameters by using
the -scans switch:

	-scans file	Use the scan sequence given in the named file.

The specified file should be a text file containing a "scan script".
The script specifies the contents and ordering of the scans to be emitted.
Each entry in the script defines one scan.  A scan definition specifies
the components to be included in the scan, and for progressive JPEG it also
specifies the progression parameters Ss,Se,Ah,Al for the scan.  Scan
definitions are separated by semicolons (';').  A semicolon after the last
scan definition is optional.

Each scan definition contains one to four component indexes, optionally
followed by a colon (':') and the four progressive-JPEG parameters.  The
component indexes denote which color component(s) are to be transmitted in
the scan.  Components are numbered in the order in which they appear in the
JPEG SOF marker, with the first component being numbered 0.  (Note that these
indexes are not the "component ID" codes assigned to the components, just
positional indexes.)

The progression parameters for each scan are:
	Ss	Zigzag index of first coefficient included in scan
	Se	Zigzag index of last coefficient included in scan
	Ah	Zero for first scan of a coefficient, else Al of prior scan
	Al	Successive approximation low bit position for scan
If the progression parameters are omitted, the values 0,63,0,0 are used,
producing a sequential JPEG file.  cjpeg automatically determines whether
the script represents a progressive or sequential file, by observing whether
Ss and Se values other than 0 and 63 appear.  (The -progressive switch is
not needed to specify this; in fact, it is ignored when -scans appears.)
The scan script must meet the JPEG restrictions on progression sequences.
(cjpeg checks that the spec's requirements are obeyed.)

Scan script files are free format, in that arbitrary whitespace can appear
between numbers and around punctuation.  Also, comments can be included: a
comment starts with '#' and extends to the end of the line.  For additional
legibility, commas or dashes can be placed between values.  (Actually, any
single punctuation character other than ':' or ';' can be inserted.)  For
example, the following two scan definitions are equivalent:
	0 1 2: 0 63 0 0;
	0,1,2 : 0-63, 0,0 ;

Here is an example of a scan script that generates a partially interleaved
sequential JPEG file:

	0;			# Y only in first scan
	1 2;			# Cb and Cr in second scan

Here is an example of a progressive scan script using only spectral selection
(no successive approximation):

	# Interleaved DC scan for Y,Cb,Cr:
	0,1,2: 0-0,   0, 0 ;
	# AC scans:
	0:     1-2,   0, 0 ;	# First two Y AC coefficients
	0:     3-5,   0, 0 ;	# Three more
	1:     1-63,  0, 0 ;	# All AC coefficients for Cb
	2:     1-63,  0, 0 ;	# All AC coefficients for Cr
	0:     6-9,   0, 0 ;	# More Y coefficients
	0:     10-63, 0, 0 ;	# Remaining Y coefficients

Here is an example of a successive-approximation script.  This is equivalent
to the default script used by "cjpeg -progressive" for YCbCr images:

	# Initial DC scan for Y,Cb,Cr (lowest bit not sent)
	0,1,2: 0-0,   0, 1 ;
	# First AC scan: send first 5 Y AC coefficients, minus 2 lowest bits:
	0:     1-5,   0, 2 ;
	# Send all Cr,Cb AC coefficients, minus lowest bit:
	# (chroma data is usually too small to be worth subdividing further;
	#  but note we send Cr first since eye is least sensitive to Cb)
	2:     1-63,  0, 1 ;
	1:     1-63,  0, 1 ;
	# Send remaining Y AC coefficients, minus 2 lowest bits:
	0:     6-63,  0, 2 ;
	# Send next-to-lowest bit of all Y AC coefficients:
	0:     1-63,  2, 1 ;
	# At this point we've sent all but the lowest bit of all coefficients.
	# Send lowest bit of DC coefficients
	0,1,2: 0-0,   1, 0 ;
	# Send lowest bit of AC coefficients
	2:     1-63,  1, 0 ;
	1:     1-63,  1, 0 ;
	# Y AC lowest bit scan is last; it's usually the largest scan
	0:     1-63,  1, 0 ;

It may be worth pointing out that this script is tuned for quality settings
of around 50 to 75.  For lower quality settings, you'd probably want to use
a script with fewer stages of successive approximation (otherwise the
initial scans will be really bad).  For higher quality settings, you might
want to use more stages of successive approximation (so that the initial
scans are not too large).

USAGE instructions for the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software
=================================================================

This file describes usage of the JPEG conversion programs cjpeg and djpeg,
as well as the utility programs jpegtran, rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom.  (See
the other documentation files if you wish to use the JPEG library within
your own programs.)

If you are on a Unix machine you may prefer to read the Unix-style manual
pages in files cjpeg.1, djpeg.1, jpegtran.1, rdjpgcom.1, wrjpgcom.1.


INTRODUCTION

These programs implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG
(pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color
and gray-scale images.  JPEG is designed to handle "real-world" scenes,
for example scanned photographs.  Cartoons, line drawings, and other
non-realistic images are not JPEG's strong suit; on that sort of material
you may get poor image quality and/or little compression.

JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not necessarily identical to
the input image.  Hence you should not use JPEG if you have to have identical
output bits.  However, on typical real-world images, very good compression
levels can be obtained with no visible change, and amazingly high compression
is possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.  You can trade off image
quality against file size by adjusting the compressor's "quality" setting.


GENERAL USAGE

We provide two programs, cjpeg to compress an image file into JPEG format,
and djpeg to decompress a JPEG file back into a conventional image format.

On Unix-like systems, you say:
	cjpeg [switches] [imagefile] >jpegfile
or
	djpeg [switches] [jpegfile]  >imagefile
The programs read the specified input file, or standard input if none is
named.  They always write to standard output (with trace/error messages to
standard error).  These conventions are handy for piping images between
programs.

On most non-Unix systems, you say:
	cjpeg [switches] imagefile jpegfile
or
	djpeg [switches] jpegfile  imagefile
i.e., both the input and output files are named on the command line.  This
style is a little more foolproof, and it loses no functionality if you don't
have pipes.  (You can get this style on Unix too, if you prefer, by defining
TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE when you compile the programs; see install.doc.)

You can also say:
	cjpeg [switches] -outfile jpegfile  imagefile
or
	djpeg [switches] -outfile imagefile  jpegfile
This syntax works on all systems, so it is useful for scripts.

The currently supported image file formats are: PPM (PBMPLUS color format),
PGM (PBMPLUS gray-scale format), BMP, Targa, and RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit
format).  (RLE is supported only if the URT library is available.)
cjpeg recognizes the input image format automatically, with the exception
of some Targa-format files.  You have to tell djpeg which format to generate.

JPEG files are in the defacto standard JFIF file format.  There are other,
less widely used JPEG-based file formats, but we don't support them.

All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, -grayscale may be written
-gray or -gr.  Most of the "basic" switches can be abbreviated to as little as
one letter.  Upper and lower case are equivalent (-BMP is the same as -bmp).
British spellings are also accepted (e.g., -greyscale), though for brevity
these are not mentioned below.


CJPEG DETAILS

The basic command line switches for cjpeg are:

	-quality N	Scale quantization tables to adjust image quality.
			Quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75.
			(See below for more info.)

	-grayscale	Create monochrome JPEG file from color input.
			Be sure to use this switch when compressing a grayscale
			BMP file, because cjpeg isn't bright enough to notice
			whether a BMP file uses only shades of gray.  By
			saying -grayscale, you'll get a smaller JPEG file that
			takes less time to process.

	-optimize	Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters.
			Without this, default encoding parameters are used.
			-optimize usually makes the JPEG file a little smaller,
			but cjpeg runs somewhat slower and needs much more
			memory.  Image quality and speed of decompression are
			unaffected by -optimize.

	-progressive	Create progressive JPEG file (see below).

	-targa		Input file is Targa format.  Targa files that contain
			an "identification" field will not be automatically
			recognized by cjpeg; for such files you must specify
			-targa to make cjpeg treat the input as Targa format.
			For most Targa files, you won't need this switch.

The -quality switch lets you trade off compressed file size against quality of
the reconstructed image: the higher the quality setting, the larger the JPEG
file, and the closer the output image will be to the original input.  Normally
you want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that decompresses
into something visually indistinguishable from the original image.  For this
purpose the quality setting should be between 50 and 95; the default of 75 is
often about right.  If you see defects at -quality 75, then go up 5 or 10
counts at a time until you are happy with the output image.  (The optimal
setting will vary from one image to another.)

-quality 100 will generate a quantization table of all 1's, minimizing loss
in the quantization step (but there is still information loss in subsampling,
as well as roundoff error).  This setting is mainly of interest for
experimental purposes.  Quality values above about 95 are NOT recommended for
normal use; the compressed file size goes up dramatically for hardly any gain
in output image quality.

In the other direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small files
of low image quality.  Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an
index of a large image library, for example.  Try -quality 2 (or so) for some
amusing Cubist effects.  (Note: quality values below about 25 generate 2-byte
quantization tables, which are considered optional in the JPEG standard.
cjpeg emits a warning message when you give such a quality value, because some
other JPEG programs may be unable to decode the resulting file.  Use -baseline
if you need to ensure compatibility at low quality values.)

The -progressive switch creates a "progressive JPEG" file.  In this type of
JPEG file, the data is stored in multiple scans of increasing quality.  If the
file is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the decoder can use
the first scan to display a low-quality image very quickly, and can then
improve the display with each subsequent scan.  The final image is exactly
equivalent to a standard JPEG file of the same quality setting, and the total
file size is about the same --- often a little smaller.  CAUTION: progressive
JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many decoders will be unable to view a
progressive JPEG file at all.

Switches for advanced users:

	-dct int	Use integer DCT method (default).
	-dct fast	Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).
	-dct float	Use floating-point DCT method.
			The float method is very slightly more accurate than
			the int method, but is much slower unless your machine
			has very fast floating-point hardware.  Also note that
			results of the floating-point method may vary slightly
			across machines, while the integer methods should give
			the same results everywhere.  The fast integer method
			is much less accurate than the other two.

	-restart N	Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every
			N MCU blocks if "B" is attached to the number.
			-restart 0 (the default) means no restart markers.

	-smooth N	Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering noise.
			N, ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of
			smoothing.  0 (the default) means no smoothing.

	-maxmemory N	Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing
			large images.  Value is in thousands of bytes, or
			millions of bytes if "M" is attached to the number.
			For example, -max 4m selects 4000000 bytes.  If more
			space is needed, temporary files will be used.

	-verbose	Enable debug printout.  More -v's give more printout.
	or  -debug	Also, version information is printed at startup.

The -restart option inserts extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder to
resynchronize after a transmission error.  Without restart markers, any damage
to a compressed file will usually ruin the image from the point of the error
to the end of the image; with restart markers, the damage is usually confined
to the portion of the image up to the next restart marker.  Of course, the
restart markers occupy extra space.  We recommend -restart 1 for images that
will be transmitted across unreliable networks such as Usenet.

The -smooth option filters the input to eliminate fine-scale noise.  This is
often useful when converting dithered images to JPEG: a moderate smoothing
factor of 10 to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file, resulting
in a smaller JPEG file and a better-looking image.  Too large a smoothing
factor will visibly blur the image, however.

Switches for wizards:

	-baseline	Force baseline-compatible quantization tables to be
			generated.  This clamps quantization values to 8 bits
			even at low quality settings.  (This switch is poorly
			named, since it does not ensure that the output is
			actually baseline JPEG.  For example, you can use
			-baseline and -progressive together.)

	-qtables file	Use the quantization tables given in the specified
			text file.

	-qslots N[,...] Select which quantization table to use for each color
			component.

	-sample HxV[,...]  Set JPEG sampling factors for each color component.

	-scans file	Use the scan script given in the specified text file.

The "wizard" switches are intended for experimentation with JPEG.  If you
don't know what you are doing, DON'T USE THEM.  These switches are documented
further in the file wizard.doc.


DJPEG DETAILS

The basic command line switches for djpeg are:

	-colors N	Reduce image to at most N colors.  This reduces the
	or -quantize N	number of colors used in the output image, so that it
			can be displayed on a colormapped display or stored in
			a colormapped file format.  For example, if you have
			an 8-bit display, you'd need to reduce to 256 or fewer
			colors.  (-colors is the recommended name, -quantize
			is provided only for backwards compatibility.)

	-fast		Select recommended processing options for fast, low
			quality output.  (The default options are chosen for
			highest quality output.)  Currently, this is equivalent
			to "-dct fast -nosmooth -onepass -dither ordered".

	-grayscale	Force gray-scale output even if JPEG file is color.
			Useful for viewing on monochrome displays; also,
			djpeg runs noticeably faster in this mode.

	-scale M/N	Scale the output image by a factor M/N.  Currently
			the scale factor must be 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8.
			Scaling is handy if the image is larger than your
			screen; also, djpeg runs much faster when scaling
			down the output.

	-bmp		Select BMP output format (Windows flavor).  8-bit
			colormapped format is emitted if -colors or -grayscale
			is specified, or if the JPEG file is gray-scale;
			otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is emitted.

	-gif		Select GIF output format.  Since GIF does not support
			more than 256 colors, -colors 256 is assumed (unless
			you specify a smaller number of colors).  If you
			specify -fast, the default number of colors is 216.

	-os2		Select BMP output format (OS/2 1.x flavor).  8-bit
			colormapped format is emitted if -colors or -grayscale
			is specified, or if the JPEG file is gray-scale;
			otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is emitted.

	-pnm		Select PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM) output format (this is the
			default format).  PGM is emitted if the JPEG file is
			gray-scale or if -grayscale is specified; otherwise
			PPM is emitted.

	-rle		Select RLE output format.  (Requires URT library.)

	-targa		Select Targa output format.  Gray-scale format is
			emitted if the JPEG file is gray-scale or if
			-grayscale is specified; otherwise, colormapped format
			is emitted if -colors is specified; otherwise, 24-bit
			full-color format is emitted.

Switches for advanced users:

	-dct int	Use integer DCT method (default).
	-dct fast	Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).
	-dct float	Use floating-point DCT method.
			The float method is very slightly more accurate than
			the int method, but is much slower unless your machine
			has very fast floating-point hardware.  Also note that
			results of the floating-point method may vary slightly
			across machines, while the integer methods should give
			the same results everywhere.  The fast integer method
			is much less accurate than the other two.

	-dither fs	Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering in color quantization.
	-dither ordered	Use ordered dithering in color quantization.
	-dither none	Do not use dithering in color quantization.
			By default, Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied when
			quantizing colors; this is slow but usually produces
			the best results.  Ordered dither is a compromise
			between speed and quality; no dithering is fast but
			usually looks awful.  Note that these switches have
			no effect unless color quantization is being done.
			Ordered dither is only available in -onepass mode.

	-map FILE	Quantize to the colors used in the specified image
			file.  This is useful for producing multiple files
			with identical color maps, or for forcing a predefined
			set of colors to be used.  The FILE must be a GIF
			or PPM file.  This option overrides -colors and
			-onepass.

	-nosmooth	Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling routine.

	-onepass	Use one-pass instead of two-pass color quantization.
			The one-pass method is faster and needs less memory,
			but it produces a lower-quality image.  -onepass is
			ignored unless you also say -colors N.  Also,
			the one-pass method is always used for gray-scale
			output (the two-pass method is no improvement then).

	-maxmemory N	Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing
			large images.  Value is in thousands of bytes, or
			millions of bytes if "M" is attached to the number.
			For example, -max 4m selects 4000000 bytes.  If more
			space is needed, temporary files will be used.

	-verbose	Enable debug printout.  More -v's give more printout.
	or  -debug	Also, version information is printed at startup.


HINTS FOR CJPEG

Color GIF files are not the ideal input for JPEG; JPEG is really intended for
compressing full-color (24-bit) images.  In particular, don't try to convert
cartoons, line drawings, and other images that have only a few distinct
colors.  GIF works great on these, JPEG does not.  If you want to convert a
GIF to JPEG, you should experiment with cjpeg's -quality and -smooth options
to get a satisfactory conversion.  -smooth 10 or so is often helpful.

Avoid running an image through a series of JPEG compression/decompression
cycles.  Image quality loss will accumulate; after ten or so cycles the image
may be noticeably worse than it was after one cycle.  It's best to use a
lossless format while manipulating an image, then convert to JPEG format when
you are ready to file the image away.

The -optimize option to cjpeg is worth using when you are making a "final"
version for posting or archiving.  It's also a win when you are using low
quality settings to make very small JPEG files; the percentage improvement
is often a lot more than it is on larger files.  (At present, -optimize
mode is always selected when generating progressive JPEG files.)

GIF input files are no longer supported, to avoid the Unisys LZW patent.
Use a Unisys-licensed program if you need to read a GIF file.  (Conversion
of GIF files to JPEG is usually a bad idea anyway.)


HINTS FOR DJPEG

To get a quick preview of an image, use the -grayscale and/or -scale switches.
"-grayscale -scale 1/8" is the fastest case.

Several options are available that trade off image quality to gain speed.
"-fast" turns on the recommended settings.

"-dct fast" and/or "-nosmooth" gain speed at a small sacrifice in quality.
When producing a color-quantized image, "-onepass -dither ordered" is fast but
much lower quality than the default behavior.  "-dither none" may give
acceptable results in two-pass mode, but is seldom tolerable in one-pass mode.

If you are fortunate enough to have very fast floating point hardware,
"-dct float" may be even faster than "-dct fast".  But on most machines
"-dct float" is slower than "-dct int"; in this case it is not worth using,
because its theoretical accuracy advantage is too small to be significant
in practice.

Two-pass color quantization requires a good deal of memory; on MS-DOS machines
it may run out of memory even with -maxmemory 0.  In that case you can still
decompress, with some loss of image quality, by specifying -onepass for
one-pass quantization.

To avoid the Unisys LZW patent, djpeg produces uncompressed GIF files.  These
are larger than they should be, but are readable by standard GIF decoders.


HINTS FOR BOTH PROGRAMS

If more space is needed than will fit in the available main memory (as
determined by -maxmemory), temporary files will be used.  (MS-DOS versions
will try to get extended or expanded memory first.)  The temporary files are
often rather large: in typical cases they occupy three bytes per pixel, for
example 3*800*600 = 1.44Mb for an 800x600 image.  If you don't have enough
free disk space, leave out -progressive and -optimize (for cjpeg) or specify
-onepass (for djpeg).

On MS-DOS, the temporary files are created in the directory named by the TMP
or TEMP environment variable, or in the current directory if neither of those
exist.  Amiga implementations put the temp files in the directory named by
JPEGTMP:, so be sure to assign JPEGTMP: to a disk partition with adequate free
space.

The default memory usage limit (-maxmemory) is set when the software is
compiled.  If you get an "insufficient memory" error, try specifying a smaller
-maxmemory value, even -maxmemory 0 to use the absolute minimum space.  You
may want to recompile with a smaller default value if this happens often.

On machines that have "environment" variables, you can define the environment
variable JPEGMEM to set the default memory limit.  The value is specified as
described for the -maxmemory switch.  JPEGMEM overrides the default value
specified when the program was compiled, and itself is overridden by an
explicit -maxmemory switch.

On MS-DOS machines, -maxmemory is the amount of main (conventional) memory to
use.  (Extended or expanded memory is also used if available.)  Most
DOS-specific versions of this software do their own memory space estimation
and do not need you to specify -maxmemory.


JPEGTRAN

jpegtran performs various useful transformations of JPEG files.
It can translate the coded representation from one variant of JPEG to another,
for example from baseline JPEG to progressive JPEG or vice versa.  It can also
perform some rearrangements of the image data, for example turning an image
from landscape to portrait format by rotation.

jpegtran works by rearranging the compressed data (DCT coefficients), without
ever fully decoding the image.  Therefore, its transformations are lossless:
there is no image degradation at all, which would not be true if you used
djpeg followed by cjpeg to accomplish the same conversion.  But by the same
token, jpegtran cannot perform lossy operations such as changing the image
quality.

jpegtran uses a command line syntax similar to cjpeg or djpeg.
On Unix-like systems, you say:
	jpegtran [switches] [inputfile] >outputfile
On most non-Unix systems, you say:
	jpegtran [switches] inputfile outputfile
where both the input and output files are JPEG files.

To specify the coded JPEG representation used in the output file,
jpegtran accepts a subset of the switches recognized by cjpeg:
	-optimize	Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters.
	-progressive	Create progressive JPEG file.
	-restart N	Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every
			N MCU blocks if "B" is attached to the number.
	-scans file	Use the scan script given in the specified text file.
See the previous discussion of cjpeg for more details about these switches.
If you specify none of these switches, you get a plain baseline-JPEG output
file.  The quality setting and so forth are determined by the input file.

The image can be losslessly transformed by giving one of these switches:
	-flip horizontal	Mirror image horizontally (left-right).
	-flip vertical		Mirror image vertically (top-bottom).
	-rotate 90		Rotate image 90 degrees clockwise.
	-rotate 180		Rotate image 180 degrees.
	-rotate 270		Rotate image 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 ccw).
	-transpose		Transpose image (across UL-to-LR axis).
	-transverse		Transverse transpose (across UR-to-LL axis).

The transpose transformation has no restrictions regarding image dimensions.
The other transformations operate rather oddly if the image dimensions are not
a multiple of the iMCU size (usually 8 or 16 pixels), because they can only
transform complete blocks of DCT coefficient data in the desired way.

jpegtran's default behavior when transforming an odd-size image is designed
to preserve exact reversibility and mathematical consistency of the
transformation set.  As stated, transpose is able to flip the entire image
area.  Horizontal mirroring leaves any partial iMCU column at the right edge
untouched, but is able to flip all rows of the image.  Similarly, vertical
mirroring leaves any partial iMCU row at the bottom edge untouched, but is
able to flip all columns.  The other transforms can be built up as sequences
of transpose and flip operations; for consistency, their actions on edge
pixels are defined to be the same as the end result of the corresponding
transpose-and-flip sequence.

For practical use, you may prefer to discard any untransformable edge pixels
rather than having a strange-looking strip along the right and/or bottom edges
of a transformed image.  To do this, add the -trim switch:
	-trim		Drop non-transformable edge blocks.
Obviously, a transformation with -trim is not reversible, so strictly speaking
jpegtran with this switch is not lossless.  Also, the expected mathematical
equivalences between the transformations no longer hold.  For example,
"-rot 270 -trim" trims only the bottom edge, but "-rot 90 -trim" followed by
"-rot 180 -trim" trims both edges.

Another not-strictly-lossless transformation switch is:
	-grayscale	Force grayscale output.
This option discards the chrominance channels if the input image is YCbCr
(ie, a standard color JPEG), resulting in a grayscale JPEG file.  The
luminance channel is preserved exactly, so this is a better method of reducing
to grayscale than decompression, conversion, and recompression.  This switch
is particularly handy for fixing a monochrome picture that was mistakenly
encoded as a color JPEG.  (In such a case, the space savings from getting rid
of the near-empty chroma channels won't be large; but the decoding time for
a grayscale JPEG is substantially less than that for a color JPEG.)

jpegtran also recognizes these switches that control what to do with "extra"
markers, such as comment blocks:
	-copy none	Copy no extra markers from source file.  This setting
			suppresses all comments and other excess baggage
			present in the source file.
	-copy comments	Copy only comment markers.  This setting copies
			comments from the source file, but discards
			any other inessential data. 
	-copy all	Copy all extra markers.  This setting preserves
			miscellaneous markers found in the source file, such
			as JFIF thumbnails and Photoshop settings.  In some
			files these extra markers can be sizable.
The default behavior is -copy comments.  (Note: in IJG releases v6 and v6a,
jpegtran always did the equivalent of -copy none.)

Additional switches recognized by jpegtran are:
	-outfile filename
	-maxmemory N
	-verbose
	-debug
These work the same as in cjpeg or djpeg.


THE COMMENT UTILITIES

The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.
Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they
are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings.  This lets you add
annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve
them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in the JPEG
file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of
them as you like in one JPEG file.

We provide two utility programs to display COM block contents and add COM
blocks to a JPEG file.

rdjpgcom searches a JPEG file and prints the contents of any COM blocks on
standard output.  The command line syntax is
	rdjpgcom [-verbose] [inputfilename]
The switch "-verbose" (or just "-v") causes rdjpgcom to also display the JPEG
image dimensions.  If you omit the input file name from the command line,
the JPEG file is read from standard input.  (This may not work on some
operating systems, if binary data can't be read from stdin.)

wrjpgcom adds a COM block, containing text you provide, to a JPEG file.
Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any existing COM blocks, but you
can delete the old COM blocks if you wish.  wrjpgcom produces a new JPEG
file; it does not modify the input file.  DO NOT try to overwrite the input
file by directing wrjpgcom's output back into it; on most systems this will
just destroy your file.

The command line syntax for wrjpgcom is similar to cjpeg's.  On Unix-like
systems, it is
	wrjpgcom [switches] [inputfilename]
The output file is written to standard output.  The input file comes from
the named file, or from standard input if no input file is named.

On most non-Unix systems, the syntax is
	wrjpgcom [switches] inputfilename outputfilename
where both input and output file names must be given explicitly.

wrjpgcom understands three switches:
	-replace		 Delete any existing COM blocks from the file.
	-comment "Comment text"	 Supply new COM text on command line.
	-cfile name		 Read text for new COM block from named file.
(Switch names can be abbreviated.)  If you have only one line of comment text
to add, you can provide it on the command line with -comment.  The comment
text must be surrounded with quotes so that it is treated as a single
argument.  Longer comments can be read from a text file.

If you give neither -comment nor -cfile, then wrjpgcom will read the comment
text from standard input.  (In this case an input image file name MUST be
supplied, so that the source JPEG file comes from somewhere else.)  You can
enter multiple lines, up to 64KB worth.  Type an end-of-file indicator
(usually control-D or control-Z) to terminate the comment text entry.

wrjpgcom will not add a COM block if the provided comment string is empty.
Therefore -replace -comment "" can be used to delete all COM blocks from a
file.

These utility programs do not depend on the IJG JPEG library.  In
particular, the source code for rdjpgcom is intended as an illustration of
the minimum amount of code required to parse a JPEG file header correctly.

Copyright (C) 1991-1995, Thomas G. Lane.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.


This file provides an overview of the architecture of the IJG JPEG software;
that is, the functions of the various modules in the system and the interfaces
between modules.  For more precise details about any data structure or calling
convention, see the include files and comments in the source code.

We assume that the reader is already somewhat familiar with the JPEG standard.
The README file includes references for learning about JPEG.  The file
libjpeg.doc describes the library from the viewpoint of an application
programmer using the library; it's best to read that file before this one.
Also, the file coderules.doc describes the coding style conventions we use.

In this document, JPEG-specific terminology follows the JPEG standard:
  A "component" means a color channel, e.g., Red or Luminance.
  A "sample" is a single component value (i.e., one number in the image data).
  A "coefficient" is a frequency coefficient (a DCT transform output number).
  A "block" is an 8x8 group of samples or coefficients.
  An "MCU" (minimum coded unit) is an interleaved set of blocks of size
	determined by the sampling factors, or a single block in a
	noninterleaved scan.
We do not use the terms "pixel" and "sample" interchangeably.  When we say
pixel, we mean an element of the full-size image, while a sample is an element
of the downsampled image.  Thus the number of samples may vary across
components while the number of pixels does not.  (This terminology is not used
rigorously throughout the code, but it is used in places where confusion would
otherwise result.)


*** System features ***

The IJG distribution contains two parts:
  * A subroutine library for JPEG compression and decompression.
  * cjpeg/djpeg, two sample applications that use the library to transform
    JFIF JPEG files to and from several other image formats.
cjpeg/djpeg are of no great intellectual complexity: they merely add a simple
command-line user interface and I/O routines for several uncompressed image
formats.  This document concentrates on the library itself.

We desire the library to be capable of supporting all JPEG baseline, extended
sequential, and progressive DCT processes.  Hierarchical processes are not
supported.

The library does not support the lossless (spatial) JPEG process.  Lossless
JPEG shares little or no code with lossy JPEG, and would normally be used
without the extensive pre- and post-processing provided by this library.
We feel that lossless JPEG is better handled by a separate library.

Within these limits, any set of compression parameters allowed by the JPEG
spec should be readable for decompression.  (We can be more restrictive about
what formats we can generate.)  Although the system design allows for all
parameter values, some uncommon settings are not yet implemented and may
never be; nonintegral sampling ratios are the prime example.  Furthermore,
we treat 8-bit vs. 12-bit data precision as a compile-time switch, not a
run-time option, because most machines can store 8-bit pixels much more
compactly than 12-bit.

For legal reasons, JPEG arithmetic coding is not currently supported, but
extending the library to include it would be straightforward.

By itself, the library handles only interchange JPEG datastreams --- in
particular the widely used JFIF file format.  The library can be used by
surrounding code to process interchange or abbreviated JPEG datastreams that
are embedded in more complex file formats.  (For example, libtiff uses this
library to implement JPEG compression within the TIFF file format.)

The library includes a substantial amount of code that is not covered by the
JPEG standard but is necessary for typical applications of JPEG.  These
functions preprocess the image before JPEG compression or postprocess it after
decompression.  They include colorspace conversion, downsampling/upsampling,
and color quantization.  This code can be omitted if not needed.

A wide range of quality vs. speed tradeoffs are possible in JPEG processing,
and even more so in decompression postprocessing.  The decompression library
provides multiple implementations that cover most of the useful tradeoffs,
ranging from very-high-quality down to fast-preview operation.  On the
compression side we have generally not provided low-quality choices, since
compression is normally less time-critical.  It should be understood that the
low-quality modes may not meet the JPEG standard's accuracy requirements;
nonetheless, they are useful for viewers.


*** Portability issues ***

Portability is an essential requirement for the library.  The key portability
issues that show up at the level of system architecture are:

1.  Memory usage.  We want the code to be able to run on PC-class machines
with limited memory.  Images should therefore be processed sequentially (in
strips), to avoid holding the whole image in memory at once.  Where a
full-image buffer is necessary, we should be able to use either virtual memory
or temporary files.

2.  Near/far pointer distinction.  To run efficiently on 80x86 machines, the
code should distinguish "small" objects (kept in near data space) from
"large" ones (kept in far data space).  This is an annoying restriction, but
fortunately it does not impact code quality for less brain-damaged machines,
and the source code clutter turns out to be minimal with sufficient use of
pointer typedefs.

3. Data precision.  We assume that "char" is at least 8 bits, "short" and
"int" at least 16, "long" at least 32.  The code will work fine with larger
data sizes, although memory may be used inefficiently in some cases.  However,
the JPEG compressed datastream must ultimately appear on external storage as a
sequence of 8-bit bytes if it is to conform to the standard.  This may pose a
problem on machines where char is wider than 8 bits.  The library represents
compressed data as an array of values of typedef JOCTET.  If no data type
exactly 8 bits wide is available, custom data source and data destination
modules must be written to unpack and pack the chosen JOCTET datatype into
8-bit external representation.


*** System overview ***

The compressor and decompressor are each divided into two main sections:
the JPEG compressor or decompressor proper, and the preprocessing or
postprocessing functions.  The interface between these two sections is the
image data that the official JPEG spec regards as its input or output: this
data is in the colorspace to be used for compression, and it is downsampled
to the sampling factors to be used.  The preprocessing and postprocessing
steps are responsible for converting a normal image representation to or from
this form.  (Those few applications that want to deal with YCbCr downsampled
data can skip the preprocessing or postprocessing step.)

Looking more closely, the compressor library contains the following main
elements:

  Preprocessing:
    * Color space conversion (e.g., RGB to YCbCr).
    * Edge expansion and downsampling.  Optionally, this step can do simple
      smoothing --- this is often helpful for low-quality source data.
  JPEG proper:
    * MCU assembly, DCT, quantization.
    * Entropy coding (sequential or progressive, Huffman or arithmetic).

In addition to these modules we need overall control, marker generation,
and support code (memory management & error handling).  There is also a
module responsible for physically writing the output data --- typically
this is just an interface to fwrite(), but some applications may need to
do something else with the data.

The decompressor library contains the following main elements:

  JPEG proper:
    * Entropy decoding (sequential or progressive, Huffman or arithmetic).
    * Dequantization, inverse DCT, MCU disassembly.
  Postprocessing:
    * Upsampling.  Optionally, this step may be able to do more general
      rescaling of the image.
    * Color space conversion (e.g., YCbCr to RGB).  This step may also
      provide gamma adjustment [ currently it does not ].
    * Optional color quantization (e.g., reduction to 256 colors).
    * Optional color precision reduction (e.g., 24-bit to 15-bit color).
      [This feature is not currently implemented.]

We also need overall control, marker parsing, and a data source module.
The support code (memory management & error handling) can be shared with
the compression half of the library.

There may be several implementations of each of these elements, particularly
in the decompressor, where a wide range of speed/quality tradeoffs is very
useful.  It must be understood that some of the best speedups involve
merging adjacent steps in the pipeline.  For example, upsampling, color space
conversion, and color quantization might all be done at once when using a
low-quality ordered-dither technique.  The system architecture is designed to
allow such merging where appropriate.


Note: it is convenient to regard edge expansion (padding to block boundaries)
as a preprocessing/postprocessing function, even though the JPEG spec includes
it in compression/decompression.  We do this because downsampling/upsampling
can be simplified a little if they work on padded data: it's not necessary to
have special cases at the right and bottom edges.  Therefore the interface
buffer is always an integral number of blocks wide and high, and we expect
compression preprocessing to pad the source data properly.  Padding will occur
only to the next block (8-sample) boundary.  In an interleaved-scan situation,
additional dummy blocks may be used to fill out MCUs, but the MCU assembly and
disassembly logic will create or discard these blocks internally.  (This is
advantageous for speed reasons, since we avoid DCTing the dummy blocks.
It also permits a small reduction in file size, because the compressor can
choose dummy block contents so as to minimize their size in compressed form.
Finally, it makes the interface buffer specification independent of whether
the file is actually interleaved or not.)  Applications that wish to deal
directly with the downsampled data must provide similar buffering and padding
for odd-sized images.


*** Poor man's object-oriented programming ***

It should be clear by now that we have a lot of quasi-independent processing
steps, many of which have several possible behaviors.  To avoid cluttering the
code with lots of switch statements, we use a simple form of object-style
programming to separate out the different possibilities.

For example, two different color quantization algorithms could be implemented
as two separate modules that present the same external interface; at runtime,
the calling code will access the proper module indirectly through an "object".

We can get the limited features we need while staying within portable C.
The basic tool is a function pointer.  An "object" is just a struct
containing one or more function pointer fields, each of which corresponds to
a method name in real object-oriented languages.  During initialization we
fill in the function pointers with references to whichever module we have
determined we need to use in this run.  Then invocation of the module is done
by indirecting through a function pointer; on most machines this is no more
expensive than a switch statement, which would be the only other way of
making the required run-time choice.  The really significant benefit, of
course, is keeping the source code clean and well structured.

We can also arrange to have private storage that varies between different
implementations of the same kind of object.  We do this by making all the
module-specific object structs be separately allocated entities, which will
be accessed via pointers in the master compression or decompression struct.
The "public" fields or methods for a given kind of object are specified by
a commonly known struct.  But a module's initialization code can allocate
a larger struct that contains the common struct as its first member, plus
additional private fields.  With appropriate pointer casting, the module's
internal functions can access these private fields.  (For a simple example,
see jdatadst.c, which implements the external interface specified by struct
jpeg_destination_mgr, but adds extra fields.)

(Of course this would all be a lot easier if we were using C++, but we are
not yet prepared to assume that everyone has a C++ compiler.)

An important benefit of this scheme is that it is easy to provide multiple
versions of any method, each tuned to a particular case.  While a lot of
precalculation might be done to select an optimal implementation of a method,
the cost per invocation is constant.  For example, the upsampling step might
have a "generic" method, plus one or more "hardwired" methods for the most
popular sampling factors; the hardwired methods would be faster because they'd
use straight-line code instead of for-loops.  The cost to determine which
method to use is paid only once, at startup, and the selection criteria are
hidden from the callers of the method.

This plan differs a little bit from usual object-oriented structures, in that
only one instance of each object class will exist during execution.  The
reason for having the class structure is that on different runs we may create
different instances (choose to execute different modules).  You can think of
the term "method" as denoting the common interface presented by a particular
set of interchangeable functions, and "object" as denoting a group of related
methods, or the total shared interface behavior of a group of modules.


*** Overall control structure ***

We previously mentioned the need for overall control logic in the compression
and decompression libraries.  In IJG implementations prior to v5, overall
control was mostly provided by "pipeline control" modules, which proved to be
large, unwieldy, and hard to understand.  To improve the situation, the
control logic has been subdivided into multiple modules.  The control modules
consist of:

1. Master control for module selection and initialization.  This has two
responsibilities:

   1A.  Startup initialization at the beginning of image processing.
        The individual processing modules to be used in this run are selected
        and given initialization calls.

   1B.  Per-pass control.  This determines how many passes will be performed
        and calls each active processing module to configure itself
        appropriately at the beginning of each pass.  End-of-pass processing,
	where necessary, is also invoked from the master control module.

   Method selection is partially distributed, in that a particular processing
   module may contain several possible implementations of a particular method,
   which it will select among when given its initialization call.  The master
   control code need only be concerned with decisions that affect more than
   one module.
 
2. Data buffering control.  A separate control module exists for each
   inter-processing-step data buffer.  This module is responsible for
   invoking the processing steps that write or read that data buffer.

Each buffer controller sees the world as follows:

input data => processing step A => buffer => processing step B => output data
                      |              |               |
              ------------------ controller ------------------

The controller knows the dataflow requirements of steps A and B: how much data
they want to accept in one chunk and how much they output in one chunk.  Its
function is to manage its buffer and call A and B at the proper times.

A data buffer control module may itself be viewed as a processing step by a
higher-level control module; thus the control modules form a binary tree with
elementary processing steps at the leaves of the tree.

The control modules are objects.  A considerable amount of flexibility can
be had by replacing implementations of a control module.  For example:
* Merging of adjacent steps in the pipeline is done by replacing a control
  module and its pair of processing-step modules with a single processing-
  step module.  (Hence the possible merges are determined by the tree of
  control modules.)
* In some processing modes, a given interstep buffer need only be a "strip"
  buffer large enough to accommodate the desired data chunk sizes.  In other
  modes, a full-image buffer is needed and several passes are required.
  The control module determines which kind of buffer is used and manipulates
  virtual array buffers as needed.  One or both processing steps may be
  unaware of the multi-pass behavior.

In theory, we might be able to make all of the data buffer controllers
interchangeable and provide just one set of implementations for all.  In
practice, each one contains considerable special-case processing for its
particular job.  The buffer controller concept should be regarded as an
overall system structuring principle, not as a complete description of the
task performed by any one controller.


*** Compression object structure ***

Here is a sketch of the logical structure of the JPEG compression library:

                                                 |-- Colorspace conversion
                  |-- Preprocessing controller --|
                  |                              |-- Downsampling
Main controller --|
                  |                            |-- Forward DCT, quantize
                  |-- Coefficient controller --|
                                               |-- Entropy encoding

This sketch also describes the flow of control (subroutine calls) during
typical image data processing.  Each of the components shown in the diagram is
an "object" which may have several different implementations available.  One
or more source code files contain the actual implementation(s) of each object.

The objects shown above are:

* Main controller: buffer controller for the subsampled-data buffer, which
  holds the preprocessed input data.  This controller invokes preprocessing to
  fill the subsampled-data buffer, and JPEG compression to empty it.  There is
  usually no need for a full-image buffer here; a strip buffer is adequate.

* Preprocessing controller: buffer controller for the downsampling input data
  buffer, which lies between colorspace conversion and downsampling.  Note
  that a unified conversion/downsampling module would probably replace this
  controller entirely.

* Colorspace conversion: converts application image data into the desired
  JPEG color space; also changes the data from pixel-interleaved layout to
  separate component planes.  Processes one pixel row at a time.

* Downsampling: performs reduction of chroma components as required.
  Optionally may perform pixel-level smoothing as well.  Processes a "row
  group" at a time, where a row group is defined as Vmax pixel rows of each
  component before downsampling, and Vk sample rows afterwards (remember Vk
  differs across components).  Some downsampling or smoothing algorithms may
  require context rows above and below the current row group; the
  preprocessing controller is responsible for supplying these rows via proper
  buffering.  The downsampler is responsible for edge expansion at the right
  edge (i.e., extending each sample row to a multiple of 8 samples); but the
  preprocessing controller is responsible for vertical edge expansion (i.e.,
  duplicating the bottom sample row as needed to make a multiple of 8 rows).

* Coefficient controller: buffer controller for the DCT-coefficient data.
  This controller handles MCU assembly, including insertion of dummy DCT
  blocks when needed at the right or bottom edge.  When performing
  Huffman-code optimization or emitting a multiscan JPEG file, this
  controller is responsible for buffering the full image.  The equivalent of
  one fully interleaved MCU row of subsampled data is processed per call,
  even when the JPEG file is noninterleaved.

* Forward DCT and quantization: Perform DCT, quantize, and emit coefficients.
  Works on one or more DCT blocks at a time.  (Note: the coefficients are now
  emitted in normal array order, which the entropy encoder is expected to
  convert to zigzag order as necessary.  Prior versions of the IJG code did
  the conversion to zigzag order within the quantization step.)

* Entropy encoding: Perform Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding and emit the
  coded data to the data destination module.  Works on one MCU per call.
  For progressive JPEG, the same DCT blocks are fed to the entropy coder
  during each pass, and the coder must emit the appropriate subset of
  coefficients.

In addition to the above objects, the compression library includes these
objects:

* Master control: determines the number of passes required, controls overall
  and per-pass initialization of the other modules.

* Marker writing: generates JPEG markers (except for RSTn, which is emitted
  by the entropy encoder when needed).

* Data destination manager: writes the output JPEG datastream to its final
  destination (e.g., a file).  The destination manager supplied with the
  library knows how to write to a stdio stream; for other behaviors, the
  surrounding application may provide its own destination manager.

* Memory manager: allocates and releases memory, controls virtual arrays
  (with backing store management, where required).

* Error handler: performs formatting and output of error and trace messages;
  determines handling of nonfatal errors.  The surrounding application may
  override some or all of this object's methods to change error handling.

* Progress monitor: supports output of "percent-done" progress reports.
  This object represents an optional callback to the surrounding application:
  if wanted, it must be supplied by the application.

The error handler, destination manager, and progress monitor objects are
defined as separate objects in order to simplify application-specific
customization of the JPEG library.  A surrounding application may override
individual methods or supply its own all-new implementation of one of these
objects.  The object interfaces for these objects are therefore treated as
part of the application interface of the library, whereas the other objects
are internal to the library.

The error handler and memory manager are shared by JPEG compression and
decompression; the progress monitor, if used, may be shared as well.


*** Decompression object structure ***

Here is a sketch of the logical structure of the JPEG decompression library:

                                               |-- Entropy decoding
                  |-- Coefficient controller --|
                  |                            |-- Dequantize, Inverse DCT
Main controller --|
                  |                               |-- Upsampling
                  |-- Postprocessing controller --|   |-- Colorspace conversion
                                                  |-- Color quantization
                                                  |-- Color precision reduction

As before, this diagram also represents typical control flow.  The objects
shown are:

* Main controller: buffer controller for the subsampled-data buffer, which
  holds the output of JPEG decompression proper.  This controller's primary
  task is to feed the postprocessing procedure.  Some upsampling algorithms
  may require context rows above and below the current row group; when this
  is true, the main controller is responsible for managing its buffer so as
  to make context rows available.  In the current design, the main buffer is
  always a strip buffer; a full-image buffer is never required.

* Coefficient controller: buffer controller for the DCT-coefficient data.
  This controller handles MCU disassembly, including deletion of any dummy
  DCT blocks at the right or bottom edge.  When reading a multiscan JPEG
  file, this controller is responsible for buffering the full image.
  (Buffering DCT coefficients, rather than samples, is necessary to support
  progressive JPEG.)  The equivalent of one fully interleaved MCU row of
  subsampled data is processed per call, even when the source JPEG file is
  noninterleaved.

* Entropy decoding: Read coded data from the data source module and perform
  Huffman or arithmetic entropy decoding.  Works on one MCU per call.
  For progressive JPEG decoding, the coefficient controller supplies the prior
  coefficients of each MCU (initially all zeroes), which the entropy decoder
  modifies in each scan.

* Dequantization and inverse DCT: like it says.  Note that the coefficients
  buffered by the coefficient controller have NOT been dequantized; we
  merge dequantization and inverse DCT into a single step for speed reasons.
  When scaled-down output is asked for, simplified DCT algorithms may be used
  that emit only 1x1, 2x2, or 4x4 samples per DCT block, not the full 8x8.
  Works on one DCT block at a time.

* Postprocessing controller: buffer controller for the color quantization
  input buffer, when quantization is in use.  (Without quantization, this
  controller just calls the upsampler.)  For two-pass quantization, this
  controller is responsible for buffering the full-image data.

* Upsampling: restores chroma components to full size.  (May support more
  general output rescaling, too.  Note that if undersized DCT outputs have
  been emitted by the DCT module, this module must adjust so that properly
  sized outputs are created.)  Works on one row group at a time.  This module
  also calls the color conversion module, so its top level is effectively a
  buffer controller for the upsampling->color conversion buffer.  However, in
  all but the highest-quality operating modes, upsampling and color
  conversion are likely to be merged into a single step.

* Colorspace conversion: convert from JPEG color space to output color space,
  and change data layout from separate component planes to pixel-interleaved.
  Works on one pixel row at a time.

* Color quantization: reduce the data to colormapped form, using either an
  externally specified colormap or an internally generated one.  This module
  is not used for full-color output.  Works on one pixel row at a time; may
  require two passes to generate a color map.  Note that the output will
  always be a single component representing colormap indexes.  In the current
  design, the output values are JSAMPLEs, so an 8-bit compilation cannot
  quantize to more than 256 colors.  This is unlikely to be a problem in
  practice.

* Color reduction: this module handles color precision reduction, e.g.,
  generating 15-bit color (5 bits/primary) from JPEG's 24-bit output.
  Not quite clear yet how this should be handled... should we merge it with
  colorspace conversion???

Note that some high-speed operating modes might condense the entire
postprocessing sequence to a single module (upsample, color convert, and
quantize in one step).

In addition to the above objects, the decompression library includes these
objects:

* Master control: determines the number of passes required, controls overall
  and per-pass initialization of the other modules.  This is subdivided into
  input and output control: jdinput.c controls only input-side processing,
  while jdmaster.c handles overall initialization and output-side control.

* Marker reading: decodes JPEG markers (except for RSTn).

* Data source manager: supplies the input JPEG datastream.  The source
  manager supplied with the library knows how to read from a stdio stream;
  for other behaviors, the surrounding application may provide its own source
  manager.

* Memory manager: same as for compression library.

* Error handler: same as for compression library.

* Progress monitor: same as for compression library.

As with compression, the data source manager, error handler, and progress
monitor are candidates for replacement by a surrounding application.


*** Decompression input and output separation ***

To support efficient incremental display of progressive JPEG files, the
decompressor is divided into two sections that can run independently:

1. Data input includes marker parsing, entropy decoding, and input into the
   coefficient controller's DCT coefficient buffer.  Note that this
   processing is relatively cheap and fast.

2. Data output reads from the DCT coefficient buffer and performs the IDCT
   and all postprocessing steps.

For a progressive JPEG file, the data input processing is allowed to get
arbitrarily far ahead of the data output processing.  (This occurs only
if the application calls jpeg_consume_input(); otherwise input and output
run in lockstep, since the input section is called only when the output
section needs more data.)  In this way the application can avoid making
extra display passes when data is arriving faster than the display pass
can run.  Furthermore, it is possible to abort an output pass without
losing anything, since the coefficient buffer is read-only as far as the
output section is concerned.  See libjpeg.doc for more detail.

A full-image coefficient array is only created if the JPEG file has multiple
scans (or if the application specifies buffered-image mode anyway).  When
reading a single-scan file, the coefficient controller normally creates only
a one-MCU buffer, so input and output processing must run in lockstep in this
case.  jpeg_consume_input() is effectively a no-op in this situation.

The main impact of dividing the decompressor in this fashion is that we must
be very careful with shared variables in the cinfo data structure.  Each
variable that can change during the course of decompression must be
classified as belonging to data input or data output, and each section must
look only at its own variables.  For example, the data output section may not
depend on any of the variables that describe the current scan in the JPEG
file, because these may change as the data input section advances into a new
scan.

The progress monitor is (somewhat arbitrarily) defined to treat input of the
file as one pass when buffered-image mode is not used, and to ignore data
input work completely when buffered-image mode is used.  Note that the
library has no reliable way to predict the number of passes when dealing
with a progressive JPEG file, nor can it predict the number of output passes
in buffered-image mode.  So the work estimate is inherently bogus anyway.

No comparable division is currently made in the compression library, because
there isn't any real need for it.


*** Data formats ***

Arrays of pixel sample values use the following data structure:

    typedef something JSAMPLE;		a pixel component value, 0..MAXJSAMPLE
    typedef JSAMPLE *JSAMPROW;		ptr to a row of samples
    typedef JSAMPROW *JSAMPARRAY;	ptr to a list of rows
    typedef JSAMPARRAY *JSAMPIMAGE;	ptr to a list of color-component arrays

The basic element type JSAMPLE will typically be one of unsigned char,
(signed) char, or short.  Short will be used if samples wider than 8 bits are
to be supported (this is a compile-time option).  Otherwise, unsigned char is
used if possible.  If the compiler only supports signed chars, then it is
necessary to mask off the value when reading.  Thus, all reads of JSAMPLE
values must be coded as "GETJSAMPLE(value)", where the macro will be defined
as "((value) & 0xFF)" on signed-char machines and "((int) (value))" elsewhere.

With these conventions, JSAMPLE values can be assumed to be >= 0.  This helps
simplify correct rounding during downsampling, etc.  The JPEG standard's
specification that sample values run from -128..127 is accommodated by
subtracting 128 just as the sample value is copied into the source array for
the DCT step (this will be an array of signed ints).  Similarly, during
decompression the output of the IDCT step will be immediately shifted back to
0..255.  (NB: different values are required when 12-bit samples are in use.
The code is written in terms of MAXJSAMPLE and CENTERJSAMPLE, which will be
defined as 255 and 128 respectively in an 8-bit implementation, and as 4095
and 2048 in a 12-bit implementation.)

We use a pointer per row, rather than a two-dimensional JSAMPLE array.  This
choice costs only a small amount of memory and has several benefits:
* Code using the data structure doesn't need to know the allocated width of
  the rows.  This simplifies edge expansion/compression, since we can work
  in an array that's wider than the logical picture width.
* Indexing doesn't require multiplication; this is a performance win on many
  machines.
* Arrays with more than 64K total elements can be supported even on machines
  where malloc() cannot allocate chunks larger than 64K.
* The rows forming a component array may be allocated at different times
  without extra copying.  This trick allows some speedups in smoothing steps
  that need access to the previous and next rows.

Note that each color component is stored in a separate array; we don't use the
traditional layout in which the components of a pixel are stored together.
This simplifies coding of modules that work on each component independently,
because they don't need to know how many components there are.  Furthermore,
we can read or write each component to a temporary file independently, which
is helpful when dealing with noninterleaved JPEG files.

In general, a specific sample value is accessed by code such as
	GETJSAMPLE(image[colorcomponent][row][col])
where col is measured from the image left edge, but row is measured from the
first sample row currently in memory.  Either of the first two indexings can
be precomputed by copying the relevant pointer.


Since most image-processing applications prefer to work on images in which
the components of a pixel are stored together, the data passed to or from the
surrounding application uses the traditional convention: a single pixel is
represented by N consecutive JSAMPLE values, and an image row is an array of
(# of color components)*(image width) JSAMPLEs.  One or more rows of data can
be represented by a pointer of type JSAMPARRAY in this scheme.  This scheme is
converted to component-wise storage inside the JPEG library.  (Applications
that want to skip JPEG preprocessing or postprocessing will have to contend
with component-wise storage.)


Arrays of DCT-coefficient values use the following data structure:

    typedef short JCOEF;		a 16-bit signed integer
    typedef JCOEF JBLOCK[DCTSIZE2];	an 8x8 block of coefficients
    typedef JBLOCK *JBLOCKROW;		ptr to one horizontal row of 8x8 blocks
    typedef JBLOCKROW *JBLOCKARRAY;	ptr to a list of such rows
    typedef JBLOCKARRAY *JBLOCKIMAGE;	ptr to a list of color component arrays

The underlying type is at least a 16-bit signed integer; while "short" is big
enough on all machines of interest, on some machines it is preferable to use
"int" for speed reasons, despite the storage cost.  Coefficients are grouped
into 8x8 blocks (but we always use #defines DCTSIZE and DCTSIZE2 rather than
"8" and "64").

The contents of a coefficient block may be in either "natural" or zigzagged
order, and may be true values or divided by the quantization coefficients,
depending on where the block is in the processing pipeline.  In the current
library, coefficient blocks are kept in natural order everywhere; the entropy
codecs zigzag or dezigzag the data as it is written or read.  The blocks
contain quantized coefficients everywhere outside the DCT/IDCT subsystems.
(This latter decision may need to be revisited to support variable
quantization a la JPEG Part 3.)

Notice that the allocation unit is now a row of 8x8 blocks, corresponding to
eight rows of samples.  Otherwise the structure is much the same as for
samples, and for the same reasons.

On machines where malloc() can't handle a request bigger than 64Kb, this data
structure limits us to rows of less than 512 JBLOCKs, or a picture width of
4000+ pixels.  This seems an acceptable restriction.


On 80x86 machines, the bottom-level pointer types (JSAMPROW and JBLOCKROW)
must be declared as "far" pointers, but the upper levels can be "near"
(implying that the pointer lists are allocated in the DS segment).
We use a #define symbol FAR, which expands to the "far" keyword when
compiling on 80x86 machines and to nothing elsewhere.


*** Suspendable processing ***

In some applications it is desirable to use the JPEG library as an
incremental, memory-to-memory filter.  In this situation the data source or
destination may be a limited-size buffer, and we can't rely on being able to
empty or refill the buffer at arbitrary times.  Instead the application would
like to have control return from the library at buffer overflow/underrun, and
then resume compression or decompression at a later time.

This scenario is supported for simple cases.  (For anything more complex, we
recommend that the application "bite the bullet" and develop real multitasking
capability.)  The libjpeg.doc file goes into more detail about the usage and
limitations of this capability; here we address the implications for library
structure.

The essence of the problem is that the entropy codec (coder or decoder) must
be prepared to stop at arbitrary times.  In turn, the controllers that call
the entropy codec must be able to stop before having produced or consumed all
the data that they normally would handle in one call.  That part is reasonably
straightforward: we make the controller call interfaces include "progress
counters" which indicate the number of data chunks successfully processed, and
we require callers to test the counter rather than just assume all of the data
was processed.

Rather than trying to restart at an arbitrary point, the current Huffman
codecs are designed to restart at the beginning of the current MCU after a
suspension due to buffer overflow/underrun.  At the start of each call, the
codec's internal state is loaded from permanent storage (in the JPEG object
structures) into local variables.  On successful completion of the MCU, the
permanent state is updated.  (This copying is not very expensive, and may even
lead to *improved* performance if the local variables can be registerized.)
If a suspension occurs, the codec simply returns without updating the state,
thus effectively reverting to the start of the MCU.  Note that this implies
leaving some data unprocessed in the source/destination buffer (ie, the
compressed partial MCU).  The data source/destination module interfaces are
specified so as to make this possible.  This also implies that the data buffer
must be large enough to hold a worst-case compressed MCU; a couple thousand
bytes should be enough.

In a successive-approximation AC refinement scan, the progressive Huffman
decoder has to be able to undo assignments of newly nonzero coefficients if it
suspends before the MCU is complete, since decoding requires distinguishing
previously-zero and previously-nonzero coefficients.  This is a bit tedious
but probably won't have much effect on performance.  Other variants of Huffman
decoding need not worry about this, since they will just store the same values
again if forced to repeat the MCU.

This approach would probably not work for an arithmetic codec, since its
modifiable state is quite large and couldn't be copied cheaply.  Instead it
would have to suspend and resume exactly at the point of the buffer end.

The JPEG marker reader is designed to cope with suspension at an arbitrary
point.  It does so by backing up to the start of the marker parameter segment,
so the data buffer must be big enough to hold the largest marker of interest.
Again, a couple KB should be adequate.  (A special "skip" convention is used
to bypass COM and APPn markers, so these can be larger than the buffer size
without causing problems; otherwise a 64K buffer would be needed in the worst
case.)

The JPEG marker writer currently does *not* cope with suspension.  I feel that
this is not necessary; it is much easier simply to require the application to
ensure there is enough buffer space before starting.  (An empty 2K buffer is
more than sufficient for the header markers; and ensuring there are a dozen or
two bytes available before calling jpeg_finish_compress() will suffice for the
trailer.)  This would not work for writing multi-scan JPEG files, but
we simply do not intend to support that capability with suspension.


*** Memory manager services ***

The JPEG library's memory manager controls allocation and deallocation of
memory, and it manages large "virtual" data arrays on machines where the
operating system does not provide virtual memory.  Note that the same
memory manager serves both compression and decompression operations.

In all cases, allocated objects are tied to a particular compression or
decompression master record, and they will be released when that master
record is destroyed.

The memory manager does not provide explicit deallocation of objects.
Instead, objects are created in "pools" of free storage, and a whole pool
can be freed at once.  This approach helps prevent storage-leak bugs, and
it speeds up operations whenever malloc/free are slow (as they often are).
The pools can be regarded as lifetime identifiers for objects.  Two
pools/lifetimes are defined:
  * JPOOL_PERMANENT	lasts until master record is destroyed
  * JPOOL_IMAGE		lasts until done with image (JPEG datastream)
Permanent lifetime is used for parameters and tables that should be carried
across from one datastream to another; this includes all application-visible
parameters.  Image lifetime is used for everything else.  (A third lifetime,
JPOOL_PASS = one processing pass, was originally planned.  However it was
dropped as not being worthwhile.  The actual usage patterns are such that the
peak memory usage would be about the same anyway; and having per-pass storage
substantially complicates the virtual memory allocation rules --- see below.)

The memory manager deals with three kinds of object:
1. "Small" objects.  Typically these require no more than 10K-20K total.
2. "Large" objects.  These may require tens to hundreds of K depending on
   image size.  Semantically they behave the same as small objects, but we
   distinguish them for two reasons:
     * On MS-DOS machines, large objects are referenced by FAR pointers,
       small objects by NEAR pointers.
     * Pool allocation heuristics may differ for large and small objects.
   Note that individual "large" objects cannot exceed the size allowed by
   type size_t, which may be 64K or less on some machines.
3. "Virtual" objects.  These are large 2-D arrays of JSAMPLEs or JBLOCKs
   (typically large enough for the entire image being processed).  The
   memory manager provides stripwise access to these arrays.  On machines
   without virtual memory, the rest of the array may be swapped out to a
   temporary file.

(Note: JSAMPARRAY and JBLOCKARRAY data structures are a combination of large
objects for the data proper and small objects for the row pointers.  For
convenience and speed, the memory manager provides single routines to create
these structures.  Similarly, virtual arrays include a small control block
and a JSAMPARRAY or JBLOCKARRAY working buffer, all created with one call.)

In the present implementation, virtual arrays are only permitted to have image
lifespan.  (Permanent lifespan would not be reasonable, and pass lifespan is
not very useful since a virtual array's raison d'etre is to store data for
multiple passes through the image.)  We also expect that only "small" objects
will be given permanent lifespan, though this restriction is not required by
the memory manager.

In a non-virtual-memory machine, some performance benefit can be gained by
making the in-memory buffers for virtual arrays be as large as possible.
(For small images, the buffers might fit entirely in memory, so blind
swapping would be very wasteful.)  The memory manager will adjust the height
of the buffers to fit within a prespecified maximum memory usage.  In order
to do this in a reasonably optimal fashion, the manager needs to allocate all
of the virtual arrays at once.  Therefore, there isn't a one-step allocation
routine for virtual arrays; instead, there is a "request" routine that simply
allocates the control block, and a "realize" routine (called just once) that
determines space allocation and creates all of the actual buffers.  The
realize routine must allow for space occupied by non-virtual large objects.
(We don't bother to factor in the space needed for small objects, on the
grounds that it isn't worth the trouble.)

To support all this, we establish the following protocol for doing business
with the memory manager:
  1. Modules must request virtual arrays (which may have only image lifespan)
     during the initial setup phase, i.e., in their jinit_xxx routines.
  2. All "large" objects (including JSAMPARRAYs and JBLOCKARRAYs) must also be
     allocated during initial setup.
  3. realize_virt_arrays will be called at the completion of initial setup.
     The above conventions ensure that sufficient information is available
     for it to choose a good size for virtual array buffers.
Small objects of any lifespan may be allocated at any time.  We expect that
the total space used for small objects will be small enough to be negligible
in the realize_virt_arrays computation.

In a virtual-memory machine, we simply pretend that the available space is
infinite, thus causing realize_virt_arrays to decide that it can allocate all
the virtual arrays as full-size in-memory buffers.  The overhead of the
virtual-array access protocol is very small when no swapping occurs.

A virtual array can be specified to be "pre-zeroed"; when this flag is set,
never-yet-written sections of the array are set to zero before being made
available to the caller.  If this flag is not set, never-written sections
of the array contain garbage.  (This feature exists primarily because the
equivalent logic would otherwise be needed in jdcoefct.c for progressive
JPEG mode; we may as well make it available for possible other uses.)

The first write pass on a virtual array is required to occur in top-to-bottom
order; read passes, as well as any write passes after the first one, may
access the array in any order.  This restriction exists partly to simplify
the virtual array control logic, and partly because some file systems may not
support seeking beyond the current end-of-file in a temporary file.  The main
implication of this restriction is that rearrangement of rows (such as
converting top-to-bottom data order to bottom-to-top) must be handled while
reading data out of the virtual array, not while putting it in.


*** Memory manager internal structure ***

To isolate system dependencies as much as possible, we have broken the
memory manager into two parts.  There is a reasonably system-independent
"front end" (jmemmgr.c) and a "back end" that contains only the code
likely to change across systems.  All of the memory management methods
outlined above are implemented by the front end.  The back end provides
the following routines for use by the front end (none of these routines
are known to the rest of the JPEG code):

jpeg_mem_init, jpeg_mem_term	system-dependent initialization/shutdown

jpeg_get_small, jpeg_free_small	interface to malloc and free library routines
				(or their equivalents)

jpeg_get_large, jpeg_free_large	interface to FAR malloc/free in MSDOS machines;
				else usually the same as
				jpeg_get_small/jpeg_free_small

jpeg_mem_available		estimate available memory

jpeg_open_backing_store		create a backing-store object

read_backing_store,		manipulate a backing-store object
write_backing_store,
close_backing_store

On some systems there will be more than one type of backing-store object
(specifically, in MS-DOS a backing store file might be an area of extended
memory as well as a disk file).  jpeg_open_backing_store is responsible for
choosing how to implement a given object.  The read/write/close routines
are method pointers in the structure that describes a given object; this
lets them be different for different object types.

It may be necessary to ensure that backing store objects are explicitly
released upon abnormal program termination.  For example, MS-DOS won't free
extended memory by itself.  To support this, we will expect the main program
or surrounding application to arrange to call self_destruct (typically via
jpeg_destroy) upon abnormal termination.  This may require a SIGINT signal
handler or equivalent.  We don't want to have the back end module install its
own signal handler, because that would pre-empt the surrounding application's
ability to control signal handling.

The IJG distribution includes several memory manager back end implementations.
Usually the same back end should be suitable for all applications on a given
system, but it is possible for an application to supply its own back end at
need.


*** Implications of DNL marker ***

Some JPEG files may use a DNL marker to postpone definition of the image
height (this would be useful for a fax-like scanner's output, for instance).
In these files the SOF marker claims the image height is 0, and you only
find out the true image height at the end of the first scan.

We could read these files as follows:
1. Upon seeing zero image height, replace it by 65535 (the maximum allowed).
2. When the DNL is found, update the image height in the global image
   descriptor.
This implies that control modules must avoid making copies of the image
height, and must re-test for termination after each MCU row.  This would
be easy enough to do.

In cases where image-size data structures are allocated, this approach will
result in very inefficient use of virtual memory or much-larger-than-necessary
temporary files.  This seems acceptable for something that probably won't be a
mainstream usage.  People might have to forgo use of memory-hogging options
(such as two-pass color quantization or noninterleaved JPEG files) if they
want efficient conversion of such files.  (One could improve efficiency by
demanding a user-supplied upper bound for the height, less than 65536; in most
cases it could be much less.)

The standard also permits the SOF marker to overestimate the image height,
with a DNL to give the true, smaller height at the end of the first scan.
This would solve the space problems if the overestimate wasn't too great.
However, it implies that you don't even know whether DNL will be used.

This leads to a couple of very serious objections:
1. Testing for a DNL marker must occur in the inner loop of the decompressor's
   Huffman decoder; this implies a speed penalty whether the feature is used
   or not.
2. There is no way to hide the last-minute change in image height from an
   application using the decoder.  Thus *every* application using the IJG
   library would suffer a complexity penalty whether it cared about DNL or
   not.
We currently do not support DNL because of these problems.

A different approach is to insist that DNL-using files be preprocessed by a
separate program that reads ahead to the DNL, then goes back and fixes the SOF
marker.  This is a much simpler solution and is probably far more efficient.
Even if one wants piped input, buffering the first scan of the JPEG file needs
a lot smaller temp file than is implied by the maximum-height method.  For
this approach we'd simply treat DNL as a no-op in the decompressor (at most,
check that it matches the SOF image height).

We will not worry about making the compressor capable of outputting DNL.
Something similar to the first scheme above could be applied if anyone ever
wants to make that work.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\windows\advcore\gdiplus\test\16bpp\readme.txt ===
This is a test app for 16bpp bugs #294433, #292492, #298264, #298283, #351610, #321960.
To use it:

1) Put the machine in 16bpp mode (in Multimon, make sure all monitors are at 16bpp).
2) Run it.
3) Click the "Test" button; make sure the window is not obscured.
4) The output is written to "output.txt".

It shows the discrepancies between offscreen and onscreen rendering.
Also, if you run it on a Win9x and NT machine and compare the output, you can see
the onscreen rendering discrepancies between Win9x GDI and NT GDI.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\windows\advcore\gdiplus\test\cortest\readme.txt ===
This is a skeleton program demonstrating the usage of COM+ runtime.

You need to follow the COM+ runtime installation instructions in
GDIPLUS\tools\newcomer\README.doc before you can nmake in this directory.

The application excecutes vTest(HWND) (defined in test.c) when
the "Test" menu option is chosen.

See the gradienttst.cxx for an example of the test.  The gradienttst is derived
from the abstract Test class.  The test should implement the vEntry() virtual
function.  This is the function which will be called by the conform shell.
There is also an object factory, AcquireTst(), as well as the constructor for
the TestList class that need to be updated if you are adding new tests.  To
enable a test, you need to add the test object name in the gpcfm.scr script
file.

To run the test, type "gpcfm gpcfm.scr".  The test creates the gpcfm.log log
file.

If you are not enlisted to nttest, you will need the ntlog.h and ntlog.lib in
the ntlog directory to build...

libtest is obsolete, and should be removed eventually.
Its purpose was to check the linking of gdipstat.lib, but it's sufficiently
different from how Office links to gdipstat.lib, that it's effectively useless.

Instead, we have Engine\Flat\CrtCheck, which is an early-warning system for
our build lab to detect illegal CRT references, and of course there's
our Office build itself.

Directory structure: inc - common header files engine - GDI+ engine source code render - low-level rendering code native - builds a static library native.lib dll - builds GDIPLUS.DLL complus - managed com+ interface for GDI+ (currently abandoned) corwrap - com+ Java wrappers for GDI+ specs - documentation libtest - test program that statically links with native GDI+ libraries cortest - com+ test program that calls GDI+ through Java wrapper APIs (currently just a skeleton) dlltest - test program that links with GDI+ DLL (deprecated) To build GDI+ engine: cd <GDIPLUS>\engine build To build and run native code test program: cd <GDIPLUS>\test\libtest build obj\i386\test.exe (change i386 to alpha on alpha machines) Set up to build com+ Java wrappers for GDI+ (x86 only) Install VC 6.0: \\products\public\PRODUCTS\Rellang\VC60.98\pro\disk1\setup.exe. Reboot. Install latest Microsoft Java VM by running \\products\public\PRODUCTS\Rellang\VC60.98\SP1\MSJAVX86.EXE. Another reboot. Install latest com+ runtime drop: \\shocked\drop\com99\wk(bldXXXX)\retail\DSetup.exe.  Start a command window and run a modified version of <GDIPLUS>\tools\newcomer\corenv.cmd. Be sure to change %YOUR_VS60_DIRECTORY% and %YOUR_COR_DIRECTORY% placeholders to appropriate directory names. Type: cd <GDIPLUS>\corwrap nmake You should end up with a file named TEST.EXE in that directory. Run it, you should see a window with string "Hello World" displayed in it. To run other tests, modify the program Test.java (e.g. during the handling of WM_PAINT window message).
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\XPSP1\NT\windows\advcore\gdiplus\tools\stylechecker\readme.txt ===
This is a tool to check that source code complies with some of the rules
from the style document.

At the moment, it only checks the following:

* presence of tab characters
* lines exceeding 80 columns

But be warned: it already has code for spell-checking comments - it's just 
disabled until we have a full enough dictionary. And it will probably do more
checks in the future.


Usage:

style [<filespec>] ...

To use this script, you need to have perl in your path. If you don't already,
there's a copy of perl at \\agodfrey\public\perl; copy everything to a local
directory and add it to your path.

Run it without parameters, and it checks all source files in the current
directory. Otherwise, you can specify filespecs (with wildcards) to check just
certain files.

Output is in MSC error message format, which means you can load it into
VSlick and use the 'next-error' key to cycle through the errors.

       WIN32 APPLICATION : AppLaunch
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this AppLaunch application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your AppLaunch application.

AppLaunch.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

AppLaunch.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.
	

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named AppLaunch.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

       DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : SPCHHK
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this SPCHHK DLL for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your SPCHHK application.

SPCHHK.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

SPCHHK.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file.

	When created, this DLL does not export any symbols. As a result, it 
	will not produce a .lib file when it is built. If you wish this project
	to be a project dependency of some other project, you will either need to 
	add code to export some symbols from the DLL so that an export library 
	will be produced, or you can check the "doesn't produce lib" checkbox in 
	the Linker settings page for this project. 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named SPCHHK.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Internal Test Plan for RCML TitleTest Plan for RCML Paul de Goede Normal.dot t-kiranr Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU Test Plan for RCML Paul de Goede  Date:  Tuesday, July 06, 1999 Component Developed by: Functionality Basic Extensive (additional) 6 weeks 4 weeks Visual Conformance Basic Extensive (additional) 4 weeks 2 weeks RC to RCML dump utility 3 weeks 7/19/99 1 week Interoperability 2 weeks Accessibility 2 weeks Downlevel Testing 3 weeks International Issues 2 weeks Leak Testing 2 weeks Code Coverage 3 weeks Stress Framework Stress Test 4 weeks 2 weeks RCML Language Testing 3 weeks High Priority Testing  =sum(b2:b9)   weeks Post-Beta Testing  =sum(b10:b13)   weeks Milestone Test Signoff 8/16/99 M1 (Alpha) Testing Axes: Functionality Basic Controls & Dialogs   take a representative sample of controls and dialogs and test that they are functional (the buttons work, text entry is correct, DialogProc is functioning correctly). Extended Flags and Non-standard configurations   test dialogs with controls created with extended flags,  Property Sheet and Wizard Support   test that property sheets and wizards are correctly created and functionally correct. Create a number of representative wizards and property sheets and determine whether they can be used correctly and interact with the DialogProc(s) correctly. Dialog Resizing & Positioning Testing   since this is a new aspect of dialogs it is the area with a potential for a number of bugs.  Create a number of control and dialog configurations and test that they perform correctly when resized and the positioning flags are functioning. Extended functionality   JPG, GIF & AVI support, Font and Color additions, etc. This requires creating a number of dialogs with these different media options and verifying that they are created and function correctly. This needs a testing suite which does interactive testing, i.e. simulating user interaction with the dialogs. The current plan is to implement a Visual Test and C/C++ application which interact to automatically determine whether the dialog is functioning correctly. Visual Conformance Need to ensure that new dialogs match old style and appearance. We provide backward compatibility in terms of appearance.  This includes a large number of test cases: all the controls and their associated styles, resize effects, color and font changes. Write test application to do bit-wise correctness tests on a number of dialogs and perform regression tests with this set of images to determine that the appearance of the dialogs is consistent across different versions of the software. RC to RCML dump utility This utility provided by RCML Dev. allows dialogs from existing dialogs to be dumped to RCML style files. This needs to be tested significantly since it will aid migration from existing RC dialogs to RCML. In addition providing test coverage for this component will cover a portion of the visual verification needed for RCML. Develop a tool to drive the RCML dumper utility Setup the tool to run regression tests. Select a set of minimal functionality tests to be used as BVTs. Organize & optimize the BVTs to run as stand-alone tests. Interoperability Ensure correct functioning of RCML Dialogs when interacting with standard Win32 apps and vice versa.  This requires creating sets of test applications which ensure that windows messages and other mechanisms still function correctly when dealing with RCML dialogs. Accessibility Ensure that the dialog generation code produces dialogs which do not exhibit accessibility problems.  This requires creating a set of dialogs which cover the gamut of accessibility features and ensure that the XMLDialogProc and the dialog generation do not limit any of these features. Downlevel Testing Ensure all code is downlevel compatible Perform regression runs on downlevel platforms. International Issues RTL, Unicode & DBCS Issues. Develop Specific Tests for Far East character sets   specifically, what is required are a number of FE dialogs which have FE text and are also RTL enabled. Run regular regressions on FE builds Ensure RTL Conformance. This will take the form of regression runs which are done on RTL enabled systems. It will require a degree of test tweaking to visual conformance will need to have a separate result set for RTL. Leak Testing Do Leak testing runs of regression tests periodically Develop a set of tests specifically targeted to illicit leaks. Code Coverage Run code coverage analysis on the RCML code for regression runs Write and adjust tests to ensure maximum code coverage  Stress  Framework for automating easy generation of RCML programmatically. Place hooks in the framework for automating interactive with random dialogs Develop a stress test engine to that uses the framework and hooks to drive stress runs. RCML Language Testing Parser correctness and robustness XML Conformance Testing parameter  testing   invalid RCML input. Testing Schedule: The below tables reflects an estimated testing schedule based on full-time work. The sections in bold are high priority and essential. The other testing components will be post-Beta considerations based on available resources and time.  Component Functionality Basic Extensive (additional) 6 weeks 4 weeks Visual Conformance Basic Extensive (additional) 4 weeks 2 weeks RC to RCML dump utility 3 weeks 1 week Interoperability 2 weeks Accessibility 2 weeks Downlevel Testing 3 weeks International Issues 2 weeks Leak Testing 2 weeks Code Coverage 3 weeks Stress Framework Stress Test 4 weeks 2 weeks RCML Language Testing 3 weeks High Priority Testing  =sum(b2:b9)   weeks Post-Beta Testing  =sum(b10:b13)   weeks Testing Resources: Currently there is one tester from the User & GDI Test group working on this project.  Testing Status: Gain familiarity with RCML and XML Completed Initial Guerilla Testing Completed RC to RCML dump utility test Partially Completed

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation RCML: CONTROL CHANGES TitleRCML: CONTROL CHANGES t-kiranr Normal.dot t-kiranr Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU RCML: CONTROL CHANGES Overview There are two main categories that the control changes will fall into.  Changes that are necessary to get RCML as a viable option to existing and new resource file formats.  Changes that are necessary to get HTML-like support in the controls.  This means providing a way for the controls to handle rich text and other HTML type functions. RCML for all intensive purposes is already at the stage where it can be used on a limited basis. This is a list of possible control changes that should be made in order to enhance the RCML experience.  Some of these changes could actually be implemented by RCML.  For those changesI have put  RCML Change  next to the functionality. USER Controls Remarks Assigned To Edit Control Categorization - filename, date, time, currency etc.  RCML change NLS+ support - converting locale specific date, time to a 'standard' - perhaps on WM_GETTEXT  RCML change Ability to change the Edit Control Background color Image Control  Support of GDI+, jpeg, gif, png, bmp  Caching of GDI+ state  RCML change? Support of Animated images (maybe outside of GDI+)  AVI/MPEG support  Combo/ List Support  Implement full range of border-styles Allow hottracking (hotunderlineon, off, mouse overs) Label / Static  Support richer text using Text+ services or HTMLLite control.  Buttons  Set a mask color  (set a color in a buttons picture to be transparent) Style support for all controls (where applicable).  Set background color, font, color Disabled Picture, Down Picture Set Icon to be displayed  (on certain messages) RCML change? Scrollbars Need to implement Ownerdraw scrollbars Common Controls  Date/Time Picker Fix bug in way dates are displayed, instead of 7/ 4/99 7/4/99 Scroll bar Add background color All controls should enable the right click feature (like Scroll bars) Should have a field called Win32Styles= WS_Child, etc.  Win32StylesEX= WS_EX_Style .  This will allow people who want to turn off/on a bit to do it easily without Anding and Oring everthing together RCML Change Scroll bars should be implemented in all controls All controls should have tab indexes HTML-like Support The controls must be revised to handle a call to the DrawFormattedText API.  These specifications are contained in this document: \\letterbox\doc\text+api.doc
