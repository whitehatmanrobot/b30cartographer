Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Catalog Event Notification TitleCatalog Event Notification Murat Ersan Normal.dot Murat Ersan Microsoft Word 9.0 8i@i0bjbjU Catalog Event Notification Overview This is the design spec on how the event notification works in the Catalog. This includes initial requirements, the event notification technology considerations, how a consumer subscribes to events, what the catalog notification infrastructure looks like and unresolved issues. Requirements: The event notification mechanism should be simple and easy to consume events. It shouldn t pull other dependencies onto internal/external consumers. It should be reasonably fast, not causing performance bottlenecks on the provider (catalog server) and on the consumer.  The catalog events will be served to transient-only listeners. Providing events to consumers written in managed code is critical. The consumer should be able to specify the table and optionally the rows that it wants to receive change notification from. The catalog must be able to figure out whether there are any consumers who are listening for events and shouldn t fire events if there aren t any. Even when there are consumers listening to events, the catalog shouldn t fire events from tables that are not being listened to. Similarly, within a table, events should be fired only for those rows that the consumer is interested in. The schema could have knowledge as to whether a table can fire events or not. (Talked to Michel Murstein on this, the scenario he had in mind was for persistent consumers.) Eventing Technology Pros: WMI is the most commonly used instrumentation technology. It is easy to use. It is asynchronous. People are writing generic tools for event viewing. WMI ships or is freely distributable on all platforms (Win9X, NT4SPX, W2K) Cons: It is a heavyweight dependency. Do we want to force any product that wants to consume our events install WMI? Even though it ships with most products it is not installed by default, it is an option. WMI event notificating mechanism lives on another process. That means even for internal events there will be two process hops until the event reaches the comsumer. Why build in such a performance bottleneck into the product from the beginning? There is no easy way to provide events to managed code consumers.  t want COM+ Services dependency. Exists only on W2K. Doesn t provide an out of the box filtering or rule based firing. LCE for managed code is not implemented yet. Managed Code Consumers: There are two types of notification mechanisms evolving for managed code. Delegates (Tightly Coupled Events) and LCE (Publisher/Subscriber). Even though LCE provides more functionality and features it is not an option for the short term because the URT team will not implement this for the URT 1.0 release. Delegates sound like the managed form of COM Connection Points.  Connection Points: We are inclined to go with Connection Points because: The Cons of WMI. It is not clear whether the Catalog needs the sophisticated filtering mechanism that WMI provides. It would be nice. It would be an easy transition from Connection Points to Delegates (managed code). Connection points won t have the extra process round-trip that WMI does. Having the connection point interfaces doesn t prevent us from using WMI in the future. We would have an additional thin layer to provide WMI events. Issues: It is not totally asynchronous, but we will have the events fired from a separate thread. Types of events The following is a list of events that should fire change notifications: Insertion of a row to a simple table. Deletion of a row to a simple table. Update of a row to a simple table. As a consequence, the outgoing interface for the change notifications will look like this: interface ISimpleTableEvent : IUnknown HRESULT OnChange([in] ISimpleTableWrite2** i_apISTWrite,  [in] DWORD i_dwCookie); i_apISTWrite: An array of simple tables containing the changes that happened. The order of the tables is the same order as specified in the MultiSubscribe array (i_ams) specified in SimpleTableAdvise. If the user has subscribed for multiple events, the cookie can be used to identify the notification. i_dwCookie: If the user has subscribed for multiple events, the cookie can be used to identify the notification. The user needs to remember the cookie provided by SimpleTableAdvise. How does a client get event notifications? The client application that wants to receive notifications for catalog events needs to implement the ISTEvent interface. This is the outgoing interface defined by the catalog. This means the catalog will call the notification methods on this interface every time the corresponding event takes place. The client needs to go through some process to get to the IConnectionPoint interface. This can be either through the IConnectionPointContainer interface, or we can chose not to implement this container logic and return the connection point interface via a method call. The latter is a more efficient way of building the connection between the consumer and the provider because it requires less roundtrips. (This is a suggestion in Effective COM). Once the client obtains the connection point interface it will call the Advise method to let the catalog know about its interest to listening to Simple Table events. Here again, the client should be able to specify what table and what rows he is interested in. This will require us to implement an interface that the client can use to provide the catalog with more specific filtering information. interface ISimpleTableAdvise : IUnknown HRESULT SimpleTableAdvise([in] ISimpleTableEvent* i_pISTEvent, [in] DWORD i_snid, [in] MultiSubscribe *i_ams, [in] ULONG i_cms, [out] DWORD *o_pdwCookie); HRESULT SimpleTableUnadvise([in] DWORD i_dwCookie); typedef struct LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase; LPCWSTR i_wszTable; LPVOID i_QueryData; LPVOID i_QueryMeta; DWORD i_eQueryFormat; } MultiSubscribe; i_pISTEvent: This is the ISimpleTableEvent interface pointer that the user provides to the catalog. The catalog will use this interface to communicate with the consumer. i_snid: The id of the snapshot from which the consumer wants to get events. This means the consumer will get notified by the changes that happen to this snapshot and any following snapshots. i_wszDatabase, i_wszTable: The combination of a database and table uniquely identifies a table.  Both identifiers are  virtual .  A table name identifies a table having a certain logical schema independent of where its rows are actually stored.  A database name identifies a logical grouping of related table IDs. i_QueryData, i_QueryMeta, i_eQueryFormat: The query data, meta and format information.  The content of these parameters depends on the query format specified.  For more information on these parameters read the Technical Specification for Simple Tables v2. o_pdwCookie, i_dwCookie: The cookie passed back and forth between the catalog and the consumer. The cookie is used by the catalog to identify the consumer. For more information read IConnectionPoint::Advise and IConnectionPoint::Unadvise documentation. Snapshots and event notifications Using snapshots identifiers a catalog user can guarantee that multiple GetTable() calls will use the same snapshot of the underlying database. The snapshot ids (snid) can also be used with the notification system. By specifying a snid, a client tells the event manager that it wants to receive notifications from that snapshot onwards. For the event manager to be able to provide these events the snapshot that the consumer requested needs to be around. This can be done by getting a reference to the snapshot.  interface ISnapshotManager : IUnknown HRESULT ReferenceLatestSnapshot([in] DWORD* i_psnid); HRESULT ReleaseSnapshot([in] DWORD i_snid); The following is a sample that shows how a client would be able to subscribe to simple table events. The client has to implement the ISTEvent interface. The client would query for the connection point interface (ISimpleTableAdvise) off of the simple table dispenser object. Depending on what the client is interested in, it would call the Advise method specifying the Database name, Table name and the query of interest. The query format is the one used by the Simple Table infrastructure. In STConsumer::Init() the client specifies that he is interested in listening to the changes on a particular row in the namespace table. Once the connection is established, the catalog will call the client s ISTEvents methods depending on what action has happened. When the client is done processing the simple table events, he calls the Unadvise method to notify the catalog that he isn t interested in the events anymore. The connection will be removed. class STConsumer : public ISimpleTableEvent    HRESULT Init();    HRESULT Uninit();    HRESULT OnChange(in] ISimpleTableWrite2** i_apISTWrite, [in] DWORD i_dwCookie); private: ISimpleTableAdvise *m_pISTAdvise; DWORD m_dwCookie; HRESULT STConsumer::Init(DWORD i_iNamespaceID) ISnapshotManager *pISnap; HRESULT hr; STQueryCell filter; ULONG cCells // Get the Advise interface. hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (L , 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->QueryInterface(IID_ISnapshotManager, &pISnap); hr = pISnap->ReferenceLatestSnapshot(&snid); hr = pISTDisp->QueryInterface(IID_ISimpleTableAdvise, &m_pISTAdvise); // Specify the database, the table and optionally the columns  // that you want to listen to. STQueryCell filter = { &i_iNamespaceID, eST_OP_EQUAL, iTBLNAMESPACEIDS_ID, DBTYPE_UI4, sizeof(DWORD}; MultiSubscribe ms = { wszDATABASE_WONS, wszTABLEWONSIDS, &filter, 1, E_ST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS} hr = m_pISTAdvise->SimpleTableAdvise(this, snid, &ms, 1, &m_dwCookie); hr = pISnap->ReleaseSnapshot(snid); return hr; HRESULT STConsumer::OnChange([in] ISimpleTableWrite2** i_apISTWrite,  [in] DWORD i_dwCookie); ULONG cColumns, cRows; LPVOID *apData; hr = i_apISTWrite[0]->GetTableMeta(NULL, NULL, &cRows, &cColumns); apData = new LPVOID[cColumns]; for (int i = 0; i < cRows; i++) hr = i_apISTWrite[0]->GetWriteColumnValues(i, cColumns, NULL,  NULL, NULL, apData); // Do useful stuff with the column information. i_apISTWrite[0]->Release(); HRESULT STConsumer::Uninit() HRESULT hr; hr = m_pISTAdvise->SimpleTableUnadvise(m_dwCookie); m_pISTAdvise->Release(); return hr; Under construction Not up to date The interception mechanism: (This is a description of the notification implementation. Consumers don t need to know these details. It assumes that the reader has detailed information on the simple table implementation.)  The catalog code that deals with notification has two main components. These are the event manager and the event logic table. The event manager is a data member of the simple table dispenser. Therefore it is a singleton. The two interfaces that are relevant to event notification, namely ISimpleTableAdvise and ISimpleTableEventMgr, are served by the dispenser object. But all that the dispenser does is to delegate the calls on these interfaces to the corresponding methods on the event manager object.  The event logic table is responsible for providing the changes in simple tables to the event manager. This logic table will be wired to a table only if the table is a writable table and there exists a consumer who has subscribed to the events (ISimpleTableEventMgr::IsTableConsumed) of the table. If there are multiple logic tables that will be wired on to a data table, the event logic table will be the closest one to the data table. This way if another logic table performs some changes or cancels some updates, the event logic table will be able to pick up these changes. The logic table goes through the write cache and provides the event manager the changes that occurred (ISimpleTableEventMgr::CollectEvents). The event manager decides whether an update is interesting to some of the consumer. If it finds the change interesting then it will cache the row that has changed for the consumer. Once the data table successfully commits the changes, the event manager will fire the events to the consumers (ISimpleTableEventMgr::FireEvents). This will be done on a separate thread. Basically the event manager will have a queue of events to fire, and the worker thread will wake up when this queue is not empty and fire the events. In case of a failure the events won t be fired. They will get cancelled and deleted (ISimpleTableEventMgr::CancelEvents). interface ISimpleTableEventMgr : IUnknown     HRESULT IsTableConsumed([in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable);     HRESULT CollectEvents ([in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable,  [in] ISimpleTableWrite2 *i_pISTWrite, [in] ULONG i_iWriteRow);     HRESULT FireEvents();     HRESULT CancelEvents(); IsTableConsumed() is used by the wiring to figure out whether or not to hook up the event logic table. The event manager returns S_OK if there exists at least one consumer who subscribed to listen to events from this table. CollectEvents() is used by the event logic table to provide changed rows to the event manager. The logic table goes through every row and provides the event manager those that are marked as inserted, deleted, or updated. The event manager goes through the list of consumers and their queries. For each consumer that has subscribed to this change, it adds this row to the consumer s cache. FireEvents() and CancelEvents() should be used by the transaction coordinator. Once the transaction commits, FireEvents() should be called to notify the event manager to fire the events it has collected. In the same way, if the transaction aborts, CancelEvents() will be called. So the unit of work boundary is a transaction.  Details to resolve: How will the event calls be marshaled? Will we have a client side object that consumers will talk to? Will the user query contain filenames? If so what do we do? What if there are multiple threads updating the same or different table? The events should be isolated.

Also, backup files even when they are made often become out of date very rapidly, so in the event of an emergency are of less value. Through the availability of Automatic History files, that IIS generates each time the Metabase file (metabase.xml by default) was saved to disk, in the event of a configuration disaster, Hotpro.com would be able to recover to prior configuration, even if they did not make an explicit backup of their configuration. Automatic History does not eliminate the need to still do backups and especially backups to external storage mediums (tape, disk, etc API Definition The existing Restore method does not provide sufficient parameters to uniquely identify an Automatic History generated file.  Thus the following method signature is required to correctly identify an automatic history file for use with Restore: RestoreHistory IMSAdminBase2::RestoreHistory( LPCWSTR pszMDHistoryLocation, dwMDMajorVersion, dwMDMinorVersion, dwMDFlags Parameters: LPCWSTR pszMDHistoryLocation, This parameter would describe the path that should be searched for the file implied by the Major and Minor versions (or Flag).  Even though the History directory is in a well-known location, (%iisdir%\history) it provides for the ability to restore archived history files that may have been transferred to removable media (disk/cd/tape).  If this parameter is NULL we will default to the well-known location, (%iisdir%\history). dwMDMajorVersion, dwMDMinorVersion, These parameters correspond to the Metabase.xml file s version stamp.  They are used to construct the file name of the backup file.  History files are named: Metabase.xml.<Major Version #>.<Minor Version #> dwMDFlags The flag is set to RESTORE_LATEST would signal the API that the Major and Minor version parameters are to be ignored and the history file at the HistoryLocation with the largest Major (and corresponding largest Minor version) should be restored.  If this flag is specified, the dwMDMajorVersion, dwMDMinorVersion parameters must be set to 0 (zero). Return Values Returns an HRESULT that contains one of the values listed in the table below. Other errors can also be returned that are passed through from the file system, or from a CryptoAPI when secure metabase data is being saved, or from registry operations.  Value Description E_INVALIDARG An argument was invalid. ERROR_INVALID_DATA The data is invalid. ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY Insufficient memory to perform the operation. ERROR_SUCCESS The method succeeded. MD_ERROR_INVALID_VERSION The specified version is invalid. MD_WARNING_INVALID_DATA Invalid metabase data. MD_WARNING_PATH_NOT_FOUND The specified path was not found. Failure conditions Invalid location   in the event an invalid location is specified return MD_WARNING_PATH_NOT_FOUND. Invalid Major or Minor Version   version numbers are 32bit unsigned integer values.  If the corresponding metabase.xml file with the automatic history Major/Minor version is not found, return MD_ERROR_INVALID_VERSION. Invalid arguments or flags, return E_INVALIDARG. Restore fails, depending on the reason, return ERROR_INVALID_DATA, ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY, MD_WARNING_INVALID_DATA. EnumHistory The IMSAdminBase::EnumHistory method enumerates the automatic metabase history in a specified backup location. Repeated calls to this method, increasing dwMDEnumIndex from 0, will return information for each metabase history file in the history location until HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 (ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS) is returned.  IMSAdminBase2::EnumHistory( LPCWSTR pszMDHistoryLocation, pdwMDMajorVersion, pdwMDMinorVersion, pftMDHistoryTime dwMDEnumIndex Parameters pszMDHistoryLocation On input, a buffer of length MD_BACKUP_MAX_LEN times sizeof(WChar) containing an empty string or a string of up to MD_BACKUP_MAX_LEN Unicode characters that identifies the history location. If an empty string is input, the method will enumerate history in the default History file location (%IISDIR%\history), returning the history location in this parameter. If a history location is specified on input, only history files in the specified location will be enumerated. pdwMDMajorVersion Receives the major version number of the history file. pdwMDMinorVersion Receives the minor version number of the history file. pftMDHistoryTime Receives the date and time of the history file, in Universal Time Coordinate (UTC), formerly GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). dwMDEnumIndex Specifies the index number of the history file to be enumerated. Return Values Returns an HRESULT that contains one of the following values, or any errors from the file system converted to HRESULT. Value Description ERROR_INVALID_NAME Specified name is invalid. ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS No more items to enumerate. ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY Insufficient memory to perform the operation. ERROR_SUCCESS The method succeeded. Public Exposure The export and import methods need to be publicly available through Admin base object, ADSI, and WMI.   The UI should take advantage of these methods through Backup/Restore dialogs In ADSI and WMI, in both Enum and Restore APIs the pszMDHistoryLocation parameter should be optional.

Scenarios/Requirements Need other team s notification requirements. Ducttape Ducttape uses a persistent cache for its configuration information. Changes to configuration files must update the persistent cache. It must be possible to turn off automatic Cache update and trigger manual updates. If a group of files change (or the same file changes repeatedly), it should be possible to bundle the changes into a single cache update. Ducttape s Web Admin Service (WAS) must be notified of changes to the cache. The granularity of change notification should be at the item (= row) level. While WAS is performing the initial read, no changes must occur to the persistent cache (or at least to the snapshot that is being read). WAS must be notified of all file changes that might have occurred during the initial read. Do other consumers (Worker Processes etc.) have the same requirements for snapshoting/notifications? Does WAS need to be able to tell a worker process which snapshot to use? The number of directories on which change notification is monitored should be minimized.  XSP relies on in-memory caching. Changes to configuration files must flush the in-memory cache. Is it sufficient to flush all cache contents for a URL node+children? Selective for only those config objects that are actually affected by the change? It is not a requirement to repopulate the cache; instead the cache will be refilled on-demand as requests for configuration information are processed. Are there any consistency issues between Ducttape and XSP? Ex. a Ducttape worker process is running off an   snapshot finishing old requests/sessions while a new worker process is handling new requests. How will XSP in this worker process continue to use the old config? Lightning (EXE/Browser) For some config (version policy, security policy, search path), a running app domain should not pick up changes (i.e. run off a consistent snapshot), but a new instance of the same app (domain) should run with the new config. Other config needs to be picked up immediately and the consumer must be notified of the change. Need more details about notification granularity/content, managed vs. unmanaged. Change Notification mechanisms Notifying config consumers Consumers must be able to receive change notifications. The  HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/CatalogEvents.doc" Catalog Event Notification spec  describes the change notification delivery mechanism for unmanaged code consumers. When working over a persisted cache / snapshot, the change notifications will be guaranteed to give the consumer a complete and consistent view of the new snapshot. Change notifications will only be sent for items that have actually changed from the previous snapshot. The change notifications will also include an indication that no more notification for a snapshot will be sent. When working without a persisted snapshot, change notifications cannot guarantee consistent views, nor can the set of changes be minimized to items that have truly changed. However, all changes to config files are guaranteed to be reported to the consumer. Do we really need granular change notification for managed code or is cache invalidation sufficient? If we need it, at which level (collection, item, property)? How exact (we don t always have a snapshot to compare against File change notification The configuration system itself needs to monitor changes to the configuration files from which it has served/cached configuration information.  Native Config System The native config system will use a wrapper interface over the Win32 file change notification APIs, to facilitate possible sharing of change notification requests/processing with other system consumers in the same process: interface ISimpleFileAdvise : IUnknown HRESULT SimpleFileAdvise( [in] ISimpleFileEvent* i_pISTEvent, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszDirList, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszExtensionList, [in] DWORD i_eFlags, [out] DWORD *o_pdwCookie); HRESULT SimpleFileUnadvise([in] DWORD i_dwCookie); The user would need to implement ISimpleFileEvent interface to handle the changes in the file system. interface ISimpleFileEvent : IUnknown HRESULT OnFileCreate([in] LPCWSTR i_wszFilename); HRESULT OnFileModify([in] LPCWSTR i_wszFilename); HRESULT OnFileDelete([in] LPCWSTR i_wszFilename); How to track changes in the file system: Use Find*ChangeNotification methods and cache the filenames of interest so that we can figure out which files have changed. Use ReadDirectoryChangesW, which gives detailed info on what changed. This method is not available on Win95/98 and WinNT3.51. Once the event manager gets a request for file notification it will cache information (name, last modification time) about the files of interest. Then it will spawn a thread that will listen for file change notifications. As changes occur in the file system, this thread will need to update the cache of the files and report to the consumers the changes that occurred. The file information cache could get too big. Multiple directories in the search path would require multiple subscriptions for file change notification. This is because the FindFirstChangeNotification api works on a single directory and its subtree. What kind of filenames are we dealing with? Absolute, relative, UNC? What process will the file change listener live in? How do we batch multiple file changes into a single notification? Should this be at the file change notification level or at the consumer level? Managed code Config System The managed config system will likely use the XSP cache and the XSP file change notification system. How do we manage the circular dependency here?  How do we avoid duplicate notification requests from XSP/Managed Configsystem and DT/Unmanaged catalog? Do we want to tie this into the listener process? On W2K we can get file level notifications from the OS. At least on NT4/Win9x we only get directory level or even directory tree-level change notifications and have to check the individual files for changes. Should this be shared processing between XSP, config and potentially other file readers? Who should provide this infrastructure? Do we require XSP on all URT installations?  Should the cache/change notification be factored out of XSP? How can we keep cross assembly interfaces private (should we)? Persistent Cache updates ( Cookdown Snapshots In order to provide a consistent view to readers, the configuration system provides the ability to guarantee that all requests for configuration information come from a single snapshot. Snapshots require persistent caching of the configuration information. How do we manifest snapshots in the UI? Should this be an option on the table dispenser / config manager, making the dispenser statefull? Should all queries pass in a snapshot ID? When the persistent cache is created, the cached data contains references to  The files that contributed to the cache and Which files contributed to which collection in the cache. During update of the persistent cache, this information is used to compute the new snapshot from the old snapshot, applying only the minimal changes, i.e. if all the config files were edited, but the content did not change (i.e. only comments were added etc.), no new snapshot needs to be saved. Update of the persisted cache is triggered by invoking a configuration system API (currently CookDown entry point in cat.lib). Change notifications Change notifications for the persistent cache are computed at the time the new snapshot is written back to disk. Notifications include  added items (new values only) deleted items (primary key only) Do we need to provide the entire item? changed items (new values only, no information on which property has changed) Do we need property level notification? Indication on which snapshots the changes cover (old and new snapshot  Indication that no more changes will be received for this snapshot. Modes Manual A update to the persistent cache is triggered by invoking the  Cookdown  API. This API will be exposed as part of the administrative URT interfaces. There should also be a mechanism to trigger a complete recomputation of the entire persistent cache (currently forced by deleting the snapshot file). Although strictly not necessary, it is useful in recovery scenarios (corruptions of the persistent cache file, bugs in the cookdown mechanism etc.). Should this be a flag on the Cookdown API? How do we expose  methods  on the config manager/admin interfaces? The Admin UI should provide mechanisms to trigger both the manual cache update, as well as the full cache recomputation. Need to discuss with Lara/Boyd. Should the full recompute really be in the UI? Automatic with time-out A listener process must register for file change notification on all the files that contributed to the cache, as well as directory locations / files that would have contributed to the cache had they existed at the time of cookdown. On Windows 2000, the listener process will be implemented as a Win32 Service using the Services Host (svchost.exe) mechanism. This enables sharing the process with other services (likely WAS). Ducttape (SethP) is planning to write an equivalent wrapper for NT4. What do we do on Win9x? The listener process will use the file change notification wrapper interfaces described above to register for all the files that contributed to the current persisted cache, as well as files/directories that would have contributed, if they had existed when the cache was computed. The listener process will buffer file change notifications over a configurable interval ( BufferFileChangeInterval  in machine.cfg). This interval is reset with every new file change notification.  A second interval ( MaxFileChangeDelay  in machine.cfg), starts when the first file change notification is received. As soon as either of these intervals expires, the listener process triggers the update of the persistent cache by invoking the  Cookdown  API.  If during the cache update further file change notifications are received, the listener process buffers these as per the above algorithm, however it does not invoke the  CookDown  API again, even if one or both of the intervals expire. If upon completion of the cache update one or both intervals have expired, the listener process immediately invokes the CookDown API. Note that the cache update may pick up changes for which change notification is still queued in the listener process. However, since the cache update keeps track of the timestamp (and indirectly the content) of the files, a subsequent notification will simply have no effect. Do we want to leverage TxF to avoid these (benign) race conditions? In-memory Cache updates Currently only consumers of the managed configuration system require in memory caching. The managed config manager is likely going to use the XSP cache implementation, which already provides cache flushing on file change notification.

Configuration as part of the Programming Model The Configuration System is designed to give system runtimes, administrative tools, applications and other consumers of configuration information easy and efficient access to configuration information, regardless of the details of the storage format and location of the configuration information. By simply defining schema information for their application s configuration information, application developers obtain a large number of benefits: Common, human readable XML format for configuration information. Common APIs to read and write configuration information at runtime. Discoverability of configuration information to administrative tools. Automatic exposure through Microsoft s WMI infrastructure. Command-line scriptability from WSH (through WMI). Programmatic remote administration (through WMI). In the PDC release, some of the core COM+ 2.0 system components already use the configuration system to retrieve their configuration information at runtime (assembly binding resolution, AppDomain configuration). Other system components define their configuration information in such a way that it can be accessed through the configuration system (most ASP+ configuration), while others are currently only configurable by direct file manipulation or through specific APIs (code access security policy). The details on the configuration of COM+ 2.0 system components can be found in the respective specifications/documentation. Configuration Files While the configuration system is designed to be storage independent, and any applications or administrative tools written against configuration system APIs can be easily moved to a different backing store in the future, it is highly recommended to store configuration information in XML text files. Using XML text files has the following advantages: Low barrier of entry to configuration: any text-based tool can be used. Any file protocol (Windows s SMB/CIFS, FTP etc.) can be used for basic administration. XCOPY deployment: no registration is needed on application install, no cleanup is needed on application uninstall. XML editors can provide relatively rich consistency checking. Most COM+ 2.0 system configuration is stored in user-editable XML text files. Configuration File Format The XML format for configuration files is optimized for human readability: Configurable properties are expressed as XML attributes and related properties are grouped under XML elements, to render a compact, yet legible representation. Configurable properties should have a well-defined XML schema that can be used by XML editors and other XML-aware applications to perform validation or provide syntactic hints to the user. The XML schema also makes all configurable properties discoverable to generic consumers, like some administrative tools and development tools. Example 1: Singleton item   AppDomain configuration <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms"> <AppDomain      PrivatePath=".\bin;.\blaa"      SharedPath="c:\common\bin;c:\suite\utils"     ShadowCopy="True" </configuration> Example 1a: Singleton item   COM+ 2.0 AppDomain configuration Another example of a singleton configuration entry is the COM+ 2.0 AppDomain configuration: AppDomain settings can be specified at most once in each application configuration file: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms"> <AppDomain      PrivatePath=".\bin;.\blaa"      SharedPath="c:\common\bin;c:\suite\utils"     ShadowCopy="True" </configuration> The first line ( <?xml  ) declares that this file is an XML document. It is optional, but should be specified to leverage XML editing tools. The second line ( <configuration  ) defines the root element of the XML document and declares the XML schema to be used to validate the content of the root element. The  xmlns  attribute on the root <configuration> element is optional, but in order to fully leverage XML editing tools (ie. VS7 s XML editor with autocomplete etc.) it is highly recommended to include the  xmlns  attribute. The root element in URT configuration files must have the name  configuration . XML is case sensitive. For more details on XML refer to   HYPERLINK "http://www.w3c.org/xml"  http://www.w3c.org/xml The subsequent lines (<AppDomain />) carry actual configuration information, in this example the settings for the Application Domain. Individual configuration properties are expressed as XML attributes ( ShadowCopy  and  PrivatePath ). An XML element ( AppDomain> ) groups these properties into logical units. The last line ( /configuration> ) closes the root element and thus the XML document. Example 2: Collection of items   COM+ 2.0 CodeBase hints <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <CodeBase>     <CodeBaseHint Name="wininet" Version="0.5.0.10" CodeBase="http://ie" />     <CodeBaseHint Name="urlmon" Version="0.5.0.11" CodeBase="http://ie" />     <CodeBaseHint Name="mshtml" Version="0.5.0.9" CodeBase="http://ie" />   </CodeBase> </configuration>  The Assembly Codebase hint   used here again merely as an example of configuration information - is typically specified in an application configuration file and allows the COM+ 2.0 runtime to install or reinstall an assembly from the indicated location. There is one codebase hint for every assembly that is to be downloaded from a specific location. A code base hint has several properties ( Version  and the actual  Codebase In the configuration file, each code base hint is represented by an XML element ( CodeBaseHint ), while each of its properties is an attribute of this element. All code base hint elements are grouped together by a containing element ( <CodeBase> ), to ensure that all code base hints are stored in a single location in the file. Note: Refer to the  HYPERLINK "http://fusion/Projects/Helium/helium specs/policy_htm.htm" Fusion binding specification  and the   HYPERLINK "http://comrtime/specs/admin/Design%20Specification%20For%20Configuration%20Manifests.doc"  Lightning Configuration specification  for the actual/current definition of code base hints. Example 3: Nested Collections   Window/Toolbar positions Often, configuration information is more complex and requires one or more sub-items for each configuration entry. Take the example of a (fictitious) Windows application that needs to store information for each of its windows: the window position, the background color and the applicable toolbars and their position: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <Windows>     <Window Name="MainWindow" PosX=  PosY=  Width=  Height=  Color= Green       <Toolbar Name= Formatting  PosX=  PosY=       <Toolbar Name= Standard  PosX=  PosY=     </Window>     <Window Name="StockTicker" PosX=  PosY=  Width=  Height=  Color=       <Toolbar Name= BuySell  PosX=  PosY=     </Window>   </Windows> </configuration> This example represents the definition of two  Windows  (a collection of  Window  items). Each Window in turn has one or more  Toolbar  items. The simple properties of a  Window  are expressed as XML attributes (  etc.). The  Toolbars  that the used chose for each Window are expressed as  Toolbar  sub-elements of the  Window  element, which in turn have attributes.  The last line ( /configuration> ) closes the root element and thus the XML document. Configuration File Hierarchies Applications and hosting platforms have different requirements on their configuration and the levels at which configuration information must be specified. While the configuration system provides an open, flexible architecture to accommodate these different requirements, application and hosting platform authors are encouraged to strive for uniformity by choosing one or more of the following, commonly used configuration levels, when determining their configuration file hierarchy. Application configuration files Most applications have a well-defined root, typically corresponding to a root directory in the file system. The exact mechanism for determining the application root depends on the kind of application (more precisely: on the host that creates the application domain). For applications hosted in a web server, for example, the application root directory is the physical directory associated with the root URL of the application. For standalone executables, the application root directory is the directory containing the PE image. Other hosts can define their own semantics for determining the application root. Applications should store any configuration that applies to all instances of the application, regardless of currently logged on user or other context, in a configuration file in the application root directory. The configuration file name should be some derivative of the application.  Example: For standard EXEs, the exe host uses the root name of the executable with a   file extension as the file name of the configuration file (i.e.  Foo.cfg  for  Foo.exe ). This naming schema supports more than one EXE per file system directory. Example: For ASP+ applications, the web server host uses the same file name ( config.web ) for all its configuration files (it assumes at most one application per directory). Machine configuration files Some configuration information applies to all applications on a machine. This includes policy (security, version binding etc.) as well as defaults that should be applied if an application does not specify it s own configuration. In the PDC release, the COM+ 2.0 system itself uses several machine-level configuration files: %windir%\admin.cfg: administrative overrides for assembly binding policy. %windir%\complus\<complusversion>\config\machine.cfg: the machine-level defaults for application-specific configuration. %windir%\complus\<complusversion>\config.web: the default configuration file for web server (including MyWeb). %windir%\complus\<complusversion>\config\security.cfg: the default code-access security policy. User configuration files Some applications/hosts need to support per-user configuration information. This configuration information is typically stored in configuration files that reside in the user profile (%appdata% environment variable on Windows 2000). Per-user application settings Application specific settings that should only be visible to a single user, not to all users of an application, should be stored in a separate configuration file in the user profile. Hosts can define the name and location of the per-user/per-application configuration file as part of their configuration file merge hierarchy. Hosts should use a derivative of the application name as the filename (i.e. %appdata%\foo.cfg, for an application  foo.exe Applications can of course also choose to store their own configuration file in arbitrary locations, including the user profile. However, the configuration system merge view  will not include these file and administrative tools might not be able to discover these custom configuration files. Per-user system defaults Some system settings (example: code access security policy) need to be specified for each user, but apply to all applications . Hosts typically choose to store these settings in a well-known configuration file in the user profile (%appdata%\config.cfg). Merged View It is often desirable that the actual configuration for an application be a merge of the settings specified in the application s configuration file with any defaults specified in the machine configuration file and other configuration files.  Instead of the application (developer) doing this  merge  across different hierarchy levels for each configuration setting (and for each hierarchy/host that the application might need to support), an application can use the configuration system to compute a merged view across multiple configuration files. The caller only needs to indicate the kind of configuration information to retrieve; the configuration system computes the configuration file hierarchy (based on the host, and potentially the kind of configuration information) and performs the merge. This configuration system feature is not currently used for COM+ 2.0 system configuration (ASP+ configuration uses a different mechanism), but the COM+ 2.0 SDK contains samples that illustrate the mechanisms. Example 4: Directives In some cases, configuration information needs to be accumulated across a hierarchy of configuration files. Directives can be used to control the accumulation (or merge) process across the hierarchy: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <assemblies>       <add assembly="System.Data"/>       <add assembly="System.Web.Services"/>       <remove assembly="System.Xml.Serialization"/>       <add assembly="System"/>       <add assembly="System.Text.RegularExpressions"/>       <add assembly="System.Drawing"/>       <add assembly="*"/>   </assemblies> </configuration> In this example, the element name of each of the items in the <assemblies> list controls if the item is to be added to or removed from the list during merge of configuration files. Each item can carry one or more additional attributes, just like any configuration item. The only difference to regular configuration is that the element name is replaced with the directive. Accessing Configuration Information The configuration system provides uniform read and write access to all configuration information, regardless of the storage format or the location of the configuration. Some configuration information is not stored in XML files: In some cases the information might be operational information that changes frequently at application execution time and thus requires a more robust, higher performing store than a text file; in yet other cases, the information comes from legacy configuration stores (i.e. IIS meta base, COM+ 1.0 registry etc.) that application or other parts of the system access directly.  However, both the XML-based and the non-XML configuration information are programmatically accessible through the same configuration system APIs, and care has been taken to ensure that underlying stores can change in future releases, without requiring major rearchitecture of the calling system runtimes or applications. Configuration information is also automatically exposed through Microsoft s WMI infrastructure. Reading Configuration Information System runtimes, modules that extend the system runtimes, applications, as well as administrative tools, can retrieve configuration information through the Get*() methods on the  HYPERLINK  \l "_Configuration_Manager_Class" Configuration Manager class ConfigType  parameter indicates the type of configuration information to be retrieved. A configuration type usually contains more than one configuration property. Selector  parameter determines a subset of the configuration information to be accessed. It typically indicates the location of a configuration file or implies the location of all other configuration files in a configuration file hierarchy (machine/user etc.). It can also contain a simple query to limit the configuration information. Example 1: Singleton property   AppDomain ShadowCopy In this example, the configuration information consists of a single named value, which occurs exactly once in a configuration scope (file). The COM+ 2.0 system setting for application domains (as used by the EXE host) consists of such singleton properties: there can be only one  ShadowCopy  flag for each application. // Reading a single value: Boolean ShadowCopy = (Boolean)      ConfigManager.GetProperty("AppDomain", "c:\myapp\foo.cfg", "ShadowCopy Example 2: Singleton Item   AppDomain The AppDomain configuration consists of more than one property, but still each of the properties can appear at most once in a configuration scope (file). The configuration system makes it easy to retrieve all properties in a ConfigType at once:  // Reading all AppDomain values at once: IConfigItem appdomain = ConfigManager.GetItem("AppDomain", "c:\myapp\foo.cfg"); if ((Boolean) appdomain["ShadowCopy"]) {  String spath = (String) appdomain[ SharedPath String ppath = (String) appdomain[ PrivatePath Example 2a: Singleton Item   strongly typed/early bound In addition to the late bound access in the previous examples, callers can also use strongly typed accessor classes to  Avoid the explicit type casting, Improve compile time error checking Obtain syntax checking/autocomplete in development environments By convention, configuration accessor classes reside in a namespace beginning with  System.Configuration , and using part of the namespace of the class that they configure as a subnamespace. For example, the accessor class for AppDomain configuration is System.Configuration.Core.AppDomain. The strongly typed accessor classes can be automatically generated from configuration schema. In the PDC release this class generation is not publicly available, but application authors can manually define their own strongly typed accessor classes and have them returned by the configuration manager. System.Configuration.Core.AppDomain appdomain =     ConfigManager.GetItem("AppDomain", "c:\myapp\foo.cfg"); // Note: no casting necessary, development tools list available properties if (appdomain.ShadowCopy) {  String path = appdomain.SharedPath; Example 3: Collection of items   Codebase hints In this example, the configuration information is slightly more complex: every property in a ConfigType can actually occur more than once within a given configuration scope (file). The COM+ 2.0 system setting for assembly download location ( CodeBaseHint ), is a good example of such a configuration setting: every assembly that could potentially be loaded into an application can have it s own CodeBaseHint entry. IConfigCollection hints = ConfigManager.Get("CodeBase", "c:\myapp\foo.cfg"); for (int i=0; i<hints.Count(); i++) { CodeBaseHint codebase = hints[i]; Console.WriteLine(codebase.Name+": "+codebase.CodeBase); // Output: wininet: http://ie urlmon: http://ie mshtml: http://ie Example 4: Generic configuration reader In some cases (administrative tools, generic applications), it is necessary to process arbitrary configuration information without prior knowledge. The configuration system provides schema (property names, types etc.) discovery mechanisms for sophisticated tools, but also lets simple tools read configuration information in a generic way, by letting a caller enumerate the available properties in a configuration item. The example code below outputs an arbitrary set of configuration information, by only modifying the ConfigType and Selector passed to the ConfigManager.Get method: // Late bound, generic IConfigCollection collection = ConfigManager.Get(  CodeBase , "c:\myapp\foo.cfg"); for (int i = 0; i < collection.Count(); i++) { IConfigItem item= collection [i]; Console.WriteLine(""); for (int property = 0; property<item.Count(); property++) { Console.WriteLine( item[property] ); Example 5: Reading Configuration for the current Application Instead of directly specifying a file location, applications can read from their own configuration file by using the AppDomainSelector instead of a FileSelector. The AppDomainSelector retrieves the location of the configuration file from the currently running application domain: Boolean ShadowCopy =    (Boolean) ConfigManager.GetProperty("AppDomain", new AppDomainSelector(),  ShadowCopy Example 6: Queries A caller can limit the items returned into a collection by specifying a ConfigQuery class, instead of a FileSelector (or AppDomainSelector): ConfigQuery query = new ConfigQuery("Name=Wininet");  Query.Selector=new AppDomainSelector(); IConfigCollection hints = ConfigManager.Get("CodeBase", query); foreach (CodeBaseHint codebase in hints) {  Console.WriteLine(codebase.Name+": "+codebase.CodeBase);  Query capability is particularly useful for larger collections. Example 7: Nested Collections   Window/Toolbar positions IConfigCollection windows= ConfigManager.Get( Windows , new AppDomainSelector()); for (int i = 0; i < windows.Count(); i++) {   Window window = windows[i];   Console.WriteLine(window.Name+ +window.PosX+ +window.PosY);   QuerySelector q = new QuerySelector( Name= +window.Name);   q.Selector=new AppDomainSelector();   IConfigCollection toolbars = ConfigManager.Get( Toolbar , q);   for (int j = 0; j<toolbars.Count(); j++) {     Toolbar toolbar = toolbars[j];     Console.WriteLine(   + toolbar.Name+   + toolbar.PosX +   + toolbar.PosY); // Output for the example configuration file   REF _Ref466912767 \p \h  above MainWindow: 0.0   Formatting: 0.0   Standard: 0.40 StockTicker: 0.101   BuySell: 0.0 Example 8: Directives   assemblies ASP+ gives the application developer/administrator the flexibility to specify which assemblies to use during compilation. At each level in a configuration file hierarchy assemblies can be added or removed from the list. IConfigCollection assemblies =            System.Configuration.ConfigManager.Get( assemblies                                           "http://myserver/mysite"); for (int j=0; j<assemblies.Count; j++)    System.Configuration.Web.Assembly a = assemblies[j];   Console.WriteLine(a.Type); Note that the resulting list contains only assemblies that have not been removed along the configuration file hierarchy. Writing Configuration Information Administrative tools can write to the configuration system using the Put*() methods on the Configuration Manager class.  There are three separate methods for writing individual properties, an item or an entire collection of items. Example 1: Singleton property   AppDomain ShadowCopy // Writing a single value: ConfigManager.PutProperty("AppDomain", "c:\myapp\foo.cfg", "ShadowCopy , true); Example 2: Singleton Item   AppDomain // Writing all AppDomain values at once: IConfigItem appdomain = new AppDomain(); appdomain.ShadowCopy=true; appdomain.SharedPath= c:\foo appdomain.PrivatePath= .\bin appdomain.Selector=new FileSelector( c:\myapp\foo.cfg ConfigManager.PutItem(appdomain); Example 3: Collection of items   Codebase hints BaseConfigCollection hints = new BaseConfigCollection(); hints.ConfigType= CodeBaseHint hints.Selector=new FileSelector( c:\foo.cfg CodeBaseHint hint = new CodeBaseHint(); hint.Name= foo.dll hint.CodeBase= http://ie hints.Add(hint); ConfigManager.Put(hints); Managing your own Configuration Information The configuration system is designed to be extensible in several dimensions:  New properties can be added by the original author of a ConfigType. New ConfigTypes can be defined. Custom collection and item classes (accessor classes) can be defined by the author of a ConfigType. Custom merge logic for hierarchical configuration information can be defined by the author of ConfigType. Custom validation logic can be defined by the author of a ConfigType. "Drivers" for arbitrary stores can be plugged in by the author of a ConfigType to read from stores other than XML.  Custom configuration hierarchy computations can be plugged in. Adding a property to an existing ConfigType (MS INTERNAL ONLY!) This section is MS INTERNAL ONLY! The set of properties in a ConfigType are defined in a configuration schema file. In order to add a new property, it is usually sufficient to add the new property declaration to the schema of the ConfigType. The configuration system core schema is compiled into the configuration system binaries and can not be modified.  The configuration system's schema compiler utility (catutil.exe) uses this source schema to generate: The strongly typed configuration collection and configuration item classes. An XML schema (catalog.xms), that XML parsers can use to validate configuration files and that configuration file authors should specify as the namespace of the configuration root element, i.e. <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">. C++ header files for callers of the native configuration system. An optimized binary representation of the schema information for use by the configuration system itself, compiled into the configuration system binary (catalog.dll). In current config system drops, this binary schema is stored in the catalog.dll binary itself, but can be updated through the CATUTIL tool without recompiling DLL. Multiple binary schema files will be supported, to facilitate independent development for internal MS groups. Schema representation for the Component Library Engine (used by the Configuration System's Persisted Cache). The persistent cache is optional, and currently only used for IIS+ UL configuration. The schema compiler utility (catutil.exe) is invoked as follows: catutil /compile catutil.exe and catmeta.xml are internally available on   HYPERLINK "\\\\urtdist\\builds\\<build#>\\<platform>\\config"  \\urtdist\builds\<build#>\<platform>\config We are not planning to ship catutil.exe to external customers (see note about annotated schema above!). Example 1a: Add a property to the  AppDomain  collection Edit catmeta.xml as follows: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"> <DatabaseMeta InternalName="URTGLOBAL">  <Collection  InternalName ="AppDomain"  ConfigType="AppDomain" PublicRowName="AppDomain" SchemaGeneratorFlags="EMITXMLSCHEMA">  <Property InternalName ="PrivatePath" Type="String"  />  <Property InternalName ="GlobalPath"  Type="String"  />  <Property InternalName ="ShadowCopy"  Type="Boolean" />  <Property InternalName ="MyNewProperty"  Type="int32" /> </Collection> </DatabaseMeta> </MetaData> Current config drops use "PublicName" instead of "ConfigType" and require "InternalName" in addition to "PublicName". Types for properties are WSTR instead of String, UI4 instead of int32. This will change soon! Run catutil /compile. Edit config.cfg to contain the new property as desired: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms"> <AppDomain      PrivatePath=".\bin;.\blaa"      GlobalPath="c:\common\bin;c:\suite\utils"     ShadowCopy="True"     MyNewProperty= </configuration> Start consuming the new property: // Reading a single value: int myprop = (int) ConfigManager.GetProperty ("AppDomain", AppDomain.Selector, "MyNewProperty"); // Reading all AppDomain values at once: IConfigItem appdomain = ConfigManager.GetItem ("AppDomain", AppDomain.Selector); if (appdomain["MyNewProperty"] > 41) {  In order to use early binding: Run generate.exe to generate strongly typed accessor classes for managed code. Customers can also write their own classes. Ideally dev tools would generate these classes // Reading all AppDomain values at once (early bound): AppDomain appdomain = ConfigManager.GetItem ("AppDomain", new AppDomainSelector()); if (appdomain.MyNewProperty > 41) {  Defining your own ConfigType ConfigTypes are defined in a configuration schema file. In order to add a new ConfigType it is usually sufficient to add the definition of the ConfigType and it's properties to the configuration schema. If the behavior of the new ConfigType is to be similar to the behavior of an existing ConfigType, it is usually sufficient to add the new ConfigType to the same <Database> element, as each Database has it's own default behavior. If the behavior needs to be customized, refer to section   REF _Ref467247259 \r \p \h  4.3 below Configuration Schema Files Configuration schema files must be listed in the machine configuration file. For this purpose, the machine configuration file contains a  SchemaFiles  collection: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <SchemaFiles>       <SchemaFile Name= MySchema  Path="c:\myschema.xml" />   </SchemaFiles> </configuration> Example 1:  "Shape" ConfigType This example defines a fictitious "Shape" ConfigType that is to be read from an XML file. Each shape can either be a square, a triangle or a circle. Shapes have a size, expressed as width and height, as well as a color. The following source schema definition defines the ConfigType: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <MetaData   xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms">   <DatabaseMeta           InternalName="MyApp">     <ServerWiring       Interceptor="Core_XMLInterceptor"/>     <Collection            InternalName="SHAPES" PublicName="Shapes"           SchemaGeneratorFlags="EMITXMLSCHEMA NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME"           >       <Property InternalName="ShapeName"    Type="String" MetaFlags="PRIMARYKEY" />       <Property InternalName="ShapeType"    Type="int32" DefaultValue="Triangle" >         <Enum InternalName="Square"   Value="1"/>         <Enum InternalName="Triangle" Value="2"/>         <Enum InternalName="Circle"   Value="3"/>      </Property>      <Property InternalName="SizeX"           Type="int32" DefaultValue="100" />      <Property InternalName="SizeY"           Type="int32" DefaultValue="100" />      <Property InternalName="Color"           Type="int32" DefaultValue="Red" >         <Enum InternalName="Red"   Value="1"/>         <Enum InternalName="Green" Value="2"/>         <Enum InternalName="Blue"  Value="3"/>      </Property>      <QueryMeta InternalName="All" MetaFlags="ALL" />      <QueryMeta InternalName="QueryByFile" CellName="__FILE" Operator="EQUAL"  />   </Collection> </DatabaseMeta> </MetaData> After adding the following entry to the machine configuration file: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <SchemaFiles>       <SchemaFile Name= MySchema  Path="c:\myschema.xml" />       <SchemaFile Name= ShapeSchema  Path="c:\Program Files\Shapes\ShapeSchema.xml" />   </SchemaFiles> </configuration> and providing a "c:\Program Files\Shapes\Shapes.cfg" file with the following content, <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <Shape ShapeName="triangle1" />   <Shape ShapeName="square1" Type="Square" />   <Shape ShapeName="BigSquare1" Type="Square" SizeX="200" SizeY="200" />   <Shape ShapeName="BlueTriangle1" Color="Blue" /> </configuration> the "Shapes" collection can be accessed as follows: IConfigCollection shapes = ConfigManager.Get(          "Shapes",           FileSelector("c:\Program Files\Shapes\shapes.cfg")); for (int j=0; j<shapes.Count; j++)    IConfigItem s=shapes [j];   Console.WriteLine( s[ ShapeName ] + " type: "                     + s[ ] + " sx=" + s[ SizeX ] + " sy="                     + s[ SizeY ] + " Color: + s[ Color // Output:  triangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red square1 type: 1 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red BigSquare1 type: 1 sz=200 sy=200 Color: Red BlueTriangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Blue Configuration Schema Format Database Definition A database scopes several ConfigType definitions together, mainly for the purpose of applying common behavior to a set of ConfigTypes. It does not scope the ConfigType names in any way; ConfigType names must be globally unique, and should use COM+ 2.0 class naming conventions. Collection Definition InternalName The InternalName is the primary identifier for the collection: it is used internally by the configuration system (and throughout the configuration schema). It provides the ability to change programmatically visible names, without changing schema and even some application private code or queries. PublicName The PublicName indicates the publicly accessible name of the collection. The PublicName is the string that is passed in as the ConfigType parameter to the ConfigManager APIs. Schema GeneratorFlags The SchemaGeneratorFlags instructs the configuration system on how to process the schema for this collection. EMITXMLSCHEMA The "EMITXMLSCHEMA" flag indicates that this collection can be stored in XML files. NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME The "NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME" flag on a collection declares that items in this collection should appear as top level XML elements under the <configuration> root element, rather than being contained in an element that corresponds to the collection (in this case < Shapes></ Shapes> can be omitted). Specifying this flag disallows the use of the collection parent element in XML files. The advantage of using this flag is that the XML content is more compact.  The disadvantage of using this flag is that items for the collection may be "sprinkled" all over the configuration file, which may make diagnosing a configuration problem harder. NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME  flag is often used in conjunction with the   HYPERLINK  \l "_Use_Containment_Flag"  USECONTAINMENT  flag for nested collections. ItemClass The ItemClass declares what name the configuration system should use when returning items.  Property Definition InternalName The name of the property being defined. Again, this name is for internal use by the configuration system (and within schema files). PublicName The publicly visible name of the property. This is the string that can be passed to the ConfigManager.GetProperty API. Properties must have a name and a type. Permissible types are: int32 String Byte[] DefaultValue The schema can specify a default value for a property, which the configuration system applies if the store (XML file etc.) does not specify a value for the property. Enumerated Properties Properties of type int32 can be declared as enumerations, in which case the configuration system enforces that the property value is within the declared set of (string) values. Enumeration values for enumerated properties are declared as one or more <Enum> elements under the <Property> element. The <Enum> element must have an "InternalName" attribute, which indicates the symbolic name for the enumeration value, and a "Value" attribute, which indicates the numeric value. The XML configuration file for enumerated properties must use the symbolic name, rather than the numeric value. Programmatic access to an enumerated property must use the numeric value. Primary Key The primary key flag on a property indicates that this property should be considered part of the unique identity of any item in this collection. The configuration system enforces that a configuration collection does not contain more than one item with the same primary key property values. At least one of the properties in an item must be declared to be part of the primary key. It is permissible to declare all properties in a collection as part of the primary key, if no smaller unique identity can be established. Supported Queries The <QueryMeta> element indicates the set of queries that are recommended to be performed on the collection. The primary purpose of this information is to enable administrative tools to provide more powerful user interface for unknown configuration information. Query Information is optional, but it is highly recommended to provide these hints to generic consumers. The InternalName attribute provides a human readable name for the kind of query being declared as supported. The QueryCell attribute indicates the InternalName of a property on which query is supported. The special QueryCell attribute  __FILE  indicates that the collection requires a file location in order to be retrieved. The Operator attribute indicates which comparison operators are supported for this property (currently the only supported comparison operator is  EQUAL The MetaFlag "All" indicates that it is permissible to query for all items in this collection. The MetaFlag "Any" indicates that queries on any combination of properties are supported. Example 2: Contained "ShapeLabels" collection Suppose that our fictitious "Shapes" collection needs to be enhanced: each shape should have one or more text labels, either at the center of the shape or along one of the edges of the shapes area. The following source schema definition (again added to catmeta.xml) adds a child collection under the Shapes group: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms">   <DatabaseMeta           InternalName="MyApp">   <Collection InternalName="SHAPELABELS" PublicName="ShapeLabels"               SchemaGeneratorFlags="EMITXMLSCHEMA NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME"               >      <!-- this property relates the ShapeLabels collection to the Shapes collection -->      <Property InternalName="ShapeName" Type="String" MetaFlags="PRIMARYKEY" />      <!-- these are the actual Label properties -->      <Property InternalName="LabelName" Type="String" />      <Property InternalName="AppliesTo" Type="int32" >         <Enum InternalName = "Center"     Value="1" />         <Enum InternalName = "TopEdge"    Value="2" />         <Enum InternalName = "BottomEdge" Value="3" />         <Enum InternalName = "LeftEdge"   Value="4" />         <Enum InternalName = "RightEdge"  Value="5" />      </Property>   </Collection> </Database> <RelationMeta PrimaryTable="SHAPES" PrimaryColumns="ShapeName"           ForeignTable="SHAPELABELS" ForeignColumns="ShapeName"            MetaFlags="USECONTAINMENT" /> </MetaData> After editing the "c:\Program Files\Shapes\Shapes.cfg" file as follows, <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <Shape ShapeName="triangle1" />   <Shape ShapeName="square1" Type="Square" />   <Shape ShapeName="BigSquare1" Type="Square" SizeX="200" SizeY="200" >      <ShapeLabel Label="BIGSQUARE" AppliesTo="Center" />      <ShapeLable Label="Text on lower edge" AppliesTo="BottomEdge" />   </Shape>   < Shape ShapeName="BlueTriangle1" Color="Blue" /> </configuration> the labels for a shape can be accessed as follows: FileSelector f = new FileSelector("c:\Program Files\Shapes\shapes.cfg"); IConfigCollection shapes = ConfigManager.Get("Shapes", f); for (int j=0; j<shapes.Count; j++)    IConfigItem s=shapes [j];   Console.WriteLine( s[ ShapeName ] + " type: "                     + s[ ] + " sx=" + s[ SizeX ] + " sy="                     + s[ SizeY ] + " Color: + s[ Color   QuerySelector q =        new QuerySelector( Select * from ShapeLabels where ShapeName= ShapeName   q.Selector=f;   IConfigCollection labels = ConfigManager.Get( Labels , q);   for (int k=0; k<labels.Count; k++)     IConfigItem l = labels[k];     Console.WriteLine("  Label: " + l["LabelName"] +                       " Position: " + l["AppliesTo"]); // Output:  triangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red square1 type: 1 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red BigSquare1 type: 1 sz=200 sy=200 Color: Red   Label: BIGSQUARE Position: 1   Label: Text on lower edge Position: 3 BlueTriangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Blue Explanation of the additional source XML format concepts: Containment / Relations The <RelationMeta> element - defined outside of any <DatabaseMeta> section - declares two collections as related. The PrimaryTable attribute indicates the InternalName of the collection that defines the properties to which another collection relates itself. The PrimaryColumns attribute lists the InternalNames of the properties in the primary collection to which the other collection relates itself; properties are listed by InternalName and names are separated by a space character. The ForeignTable attribute names the InternalName of the collection that relates itself to the PrimaryTable. The ForeignColumns attribute indicates which properties in the ForeignTable reference the primary collection. USECONTAINMENT The MetaFlag "USECONTAINMENT" on a relation, declares that the XML representation of the foreign collection is to be contained within the XML element of the primary collection. This flag allows one to many relationships to be expressed using XML element hierarchy. Collection Behavior: Selecting Interceptors In the previous examples, the default collection behavior was used: reading through the XML store interceptor from a single configuration file, whose location must be specified by the caller (using the FileSelector).  Custom interceptors can be selected in the mwiring.xml file in the machine configuration directory. Interceptors can be selected on a per collection basis, by using the <Intercept> element in the <ManagedWiring> section of mwiring.xml. Example 3: Making "Shapes" an inheritable URL configuration The COM+ 2.0 SDK contains a hierarchy interceptor for Web Server configuration file hierarchies. The following behavior definitions makes the Shapes and ShapeLabels groups queryable along the configuration file hierarchy of the COM+ 2.0 Web Server; Shapes and Labels are inherited from the parent config file (if any), definitions in child config files are added to the inherited shapes, overriding any inherited shapes with the same name. Add to mwiring.xml: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms"> <ManagedWiring>   <!-- Definition for Shapes collection -->   <Intercept ConfigType="Shapes" Protocol="http" Order="1"              Interceptor="Microsoft.Configuration.Samples.WebHierarchyInterceptor"              InterceptorType="Transformer" />   <Intercept ConfigType="Shapes" Protocol="list" Order="2"              Interceptor="System.Config.ListMerge"              InterceptorType="Merger" />   <Intercept ConfigType="Shapes" Protocol="query" Order="1"              Interceptor="System.Config.NativeCatalogInterceptorRO"              InterceptorType="Merger" />   <!-- Definition for ShapeLabels collection -->   <Intercept ConfigType="ShapeLabels" Protocol="http" Order="1"              Interceptor="Microsoft.Configuration.Samples.WebHierarchyInterceptor "              InterceptorType="Transformer" />   <Intercept ConfigType="ShapeLabels" Protocol="list" Order="2"              Interceptor="System.Config.ListMerge"              InterceptorType="Merger" />   <Intercept ConfigType="ShapeLabels" Protocol="query" Order="1"              Interceptor="System.Config.NativeCatalogInterceptorRO"              InterceptorType="Merger" /> </ManagedWiring> </configuration> After copying the contents of shapes.cfg file into an application configuration file (i.e. %systemdrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\mysite\myapp\Config.web from   HYPERLINK  \l "_Example_1:_Machine"  Example 1 ), adding the following to the web server s machine configuration file: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <Shape Name="MasterTriangle from machine s config.web " /> </configuration> and adding the following the site configuration file (%systemdrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\mysite\myapp\Config.web): <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <Shape Name="MySiteCircle from Mysite config" Type="Circle" /> </configuration> will result in the following output (using the code from   HYPERLINK  \l "_Example_5a:_Contained"  Example 6a IConfigCollection shapes = System.Config.ConfigManager.Get(          "Shapes", "http://mysite.com/myapp"); // Output: MasterTriangle from Machine.cfg type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red MySiteCircle from Mysite config type: 3 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red triangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red square1 type: 1 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Red BigSquare1 type: 1 sz=200 sy=200 Color: Red   Label: BIGSQUARE Position: 1   Label: Text on lower edge Position: 3 BlueTriangle1 type: 2 sz=100 sy=100 Color: Blue Explanation of the behavior declaration format: ConfigType An interceptor is associated with a specific collection by specifying the collection's ConfigType (= PublicName) in the Intercept element. Protocol An interceptor can be associated to a specific kind of selector. Every selector provides a protocol string; URL selectors return "http", query selectors "query" etc. Refer to the class reference section for details on selectors. Order If more than one interceptor is associated with the same ConfigType and Protocol the order attribute decides in which order the interceptors will be invoked by the configuration system. Depending on the InterceptorType, interceptors are either invoked until the first interceptor returns ("Reader" type) or chained ("Transform" - if protocol doesn't change, "Reader", "Merger" types). InterceptorClass Indicates the interceptor to invoke. InterceptorType Indicates the kind of interceptor. Valid types are: "Merger": merges two configuration collections into one. Typically used with hierarchical configuration files. "Reader": retrieves a new configuration collection. "Transform": modifies the selector (sometimes even the configtype), but doesn't return any configuration information. "Validate": validates and potentially modifies an already retrieved configuration collection. In the above example, three interceptors are selected for each collection: Web Server Hierarchy interceptor, for protocol "http": computes the list of configuration files that correspond to a URL. List Merge interceptor, for protocol "list" (the output of a hierarchy interceptor): merges two configuration collection, preserving primary key identity and optionally (if column 0 is called "Directive" and of type int32) providing add/remove/clear/final directive semantics. The config system invokes the List Merge interceptor on pairs of parent collection and child configuration file. Native Catalog Interceptor, for protocol "query": the native config system acts as the XML storage interceptor (while there is no managed code XML interceptors) , since the native config system behavior defaults to XML storage for most databases. Refer to the reference section for information on the interceptor interfaces. Writing a custom configuration object By default, the configuration system provides two generic classes (BaseConfigItem and BaseConfigCollection) to access configuration information. This generic data representation is desirable for most administrative (generic) consumers. Strongly typed accessor properties can be defined to provide added convenience for developers that want to access a specific type of configuration information in an early bound fashion. They can also be used to add custom methods to configuration classes. These classes can be easily implemented by deriving from the BaseConfigItem and BaseConfigCollection classes and declaring their names in the schema for the ConfigType (ItemClass, CollectionClass attributes). It is also possible to provide completely independent implementations of configuration accessor classes. One reasons for doing so is the need to change the internal data representation from a collection/item basis to a more optimized structure for custom methods or for the typical access pattern of a consumer. The configuration system allows the author of a ConfigType to provide custom implementations of one or both of the generated configuration classes, or even to entirely replace the configuration classes and disabling the automatic generation of any configuration classes. Extending the Base Configuration classes Example 6c: Adding a custom method to "Shape" <?xml version ="1.0"?> <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"> <Database           InternalName="URTGLOBAL">    <Collection ConfigType="Shapes" InternalName="SHAPES"               SchemaGeneratorFlags="EMITXMLSCHEMA NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME"               ItemClass="Shape"                >   </Collection> </Database> </MetaData> The author of the configuration information can now define his/her own class for Shape items: public class Shape : System.Configuration.BaseConfigItem   public int Area {     get {       return (int) this[ SizeX ]* (int) this[ SizeY     }   public float Ratio {     get {       return (int) this[ SizeX ]/ (int) this[ SizeY     }   public Bool IsLargerThan (Shape x) {     return (x.Area > Area); ItemClass This collection attribute indicates the accessor class that the configuration system should return for this ConfigType. The class must implement the IConfigItem interface. Replacing the configuration classes The author of the configuration group can choose to implement his or her own configuration classes without using the automatically generated configuration classes. Example 6c: Changing the data representation of "Shape" In our fictitious example it turns out that consumers are using the Area and Ratio much more frequently than the SizeX and SizeY properties. The configuration item should cache these values once they are computed, and since it can derive the SizeX/SizeY from Area/Ratio with sufficient precision, it should not store SizeX/SizeY at all to reduce memory overhead: The author of the configuration information can define his/her own class for Shape items. In order to be able to continue to use the generic interceptors and to be accessible to generic configuration consumers, the new item class must implement the IConfigItem interface. The COM+ 2.0 SDK contains a sample illustrating this. Writing a custom merge interceptor If the existing merge interceptors (Property Override, List Merge, List Append/Prepend) do not cover the desired inheritance semantics for a configuration collection, a custom merge interceptor can be written and   HYPERLINK  \l "_Collection_Behavior:_Selecting"  added to the behavior declaration  of the collection. A merge interceptor is added to the behavior definition of a collection by indicating InterceptorType="Merger". A merge interceptor must implement the IConfigMerger interface. The Merge method typically: Clones the parent config collection  Modifies the cloned parent collection by merging in the items from the source collections. Returns the cloned collection. If the parent collection is to be inherited without changes, the merge interceptor can return the original collection. Writing a custom validation interceptor If additional validation for a collection is required, for example the two properties are interdependent and the value of one property governs the set of permissible values of the other property, this validation is preferably implemented in the form of a validation interceptor. This ensures that both application code reading at runtime and any administrative scripts or UI use the same validation logic. Validation interceptors must implement the IConfigReader interface. The Read method for a validation interceptor typically reads the configuration collection passed to it through the currentObject parameter and performs the validations. If any validation fails, the validation interceptor can either fail the operation by throwing an exception, or it can correct the error and modify the collection and individual items. A validation interceptor is added to the behavior definition of a collection by indicating InterceptorType="Validater". Writing a custom store interceptor If a new store needs to be made accessible through the configuration system, a store interceptor must be written. Store interceptors must implement the IConfigReader interface (refer to the   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/urt configuration system architecture.doc"  Configuration System Architecture specification  for the definition of the interface). Store interceptors must create configuration collections and items. They typically call the configuration system (ConfigManager.GetEmptyConfigCollection and ConfigManager.GetEmptyConfigItem methods) in order to create instances of the correct collection and item classes for the requested ConfigType. The configuration system currently provides the following store interceptors: System.Config.NativeCatalogInterceptorRO: Read-only interceptor that invokes the native configuration system. A store interceptor is added to the behavior definition of a group by indicating InterceptorType="Reader" and/or InterceptorType="Writer". Writing a custom hierarchy interceptor A hierarchy interceptor receives a selector object (typically a host specific selector), and turns this selector into a selector that encapsulates the list of file from which to generate a merged view. This list selector represents the configuration file hierarchy. The configuration system processes the list selector and inductively invokes the appropriate merge interceptor for pairs of the files in this list selector. Accessing Configuration information from native code The configuration system does not currently offer publicly accessible, high-performance (in-process) APIs for native code consumers. However, a WMI provider exists that ties the COM+ 2.0 configuration system into the Microsoft WMI infrastructure. WMI Provider: COMPlus20 namespace The WMI Provider is a class provider, which means that by just defining the configuration schema, the provider automatically generates the necessary WMI classes and instances. Currently these classes are not related to any other WMI/CIM classes. COM+ 2.0 configuration system information is exposed into the root\COMPlus20 namespace. Among other features, the WMI infrastructure offers Command line scripting against COM+ 2.0 configuration information. Programmatic remote administration of COM+ 2.0 configuration information. Queries across configuration collections (currently not supported by the configuration system itself). Queries across other WMI classes and COM+ 2.0 configuration information. Open Issues In addition to the issues outlined throughout the document, the following items require further attention: Revision History May 25, 2000 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH): Sections 4 and 5 are not finished yet! Rev 0.2: Done. Pending review. July 10, 2000 Rev 0.3: (MarkusH): Fixed typos in samples.  It is possible for a schema definer to indicate that the containing element ( <CodeGroup> ) should be omitted. This reduces the amount of text, but allows the individual items ( <CodeBaseHints> ) to be spread across the XML file.  Advanced hosts may even choose to not define their root to be in the file system at all, by defining their own selector and interceptor mapping.  Not all hosts may have the concept of a  current user . For example the web server host does probably not need to support per-user defaults, but rather per-site defaults.  Note that the   method can return both singletons and collections of items, thus providing a single, generic API to read all configuration information.  When reading directly from an individual configuration file (i.e. Get( assemblies file://c:\foo.cfg )), directives are not applied (unless explicitly modified by the config schema author) and the caller can obtain all entries, including the directives. This is useful for administrative tools that need to modify the content of a configuration file.  The elements of the list selector are actually in turn selectors, which typically are file selectors, but can also be arbitrary selectors. Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES  COM+ 2.0

It is an effort to provide clear reasons why we have arrived at specific choices for the primary configuration API of Application Server.  The following APIs were researched or considered: Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI) OLEDB and ADO COM+ Runtime 2.0 Interface (Reflection) COM+ Services 1.0 Interface (COMAdmin) SQL Server 7.0 Interface (SQL-DMO) Windows Management Interface (WMI) New API based on the COMAdmin API In order to understand this document and the customers that this interface is going to serve, a reader should first be familiar with the  Project 42 Configuration API Requirements  Document (AppServerConfigRequirements.doc found in   HYPERLINK \\\\comvss\\cosss  \\comvss\cosss  source safe at $\Catalog42\Info. It is also important to realize that the catalog infrastructure all ready in place will be used to support this and that the API should be only a thin layer on top of it.   This discussion is also relevant to both the Application Server 1.0 release (based on the current code base of COM+ and IIS) and Application Server 2.0 release (based on the new URT code base). Summary of general review ADSI is the administration interface for directory services but not all windows management.  The ADSI team points to WMI as the owner of configuration of objects on windows systems.  Therefore ADSI was not chosen as the interface for administering the Application Server. OLEDB and ADO were also briefly considered for the configuration API.  However, they were not chosen due to the complexity of building an OLE DB provider and because the configuration API is doing special case data management and extended functionality (for instance, InstallComponent functional calls). The COM+ Runtime 2.0 Interface   Reflection was also reviewed.  However it s target audience is more of the lower level developers.  Our audience is more administrators and script programmers.  This difference drives the two requirements in different directions, and so the configuration API will not be modeled after Reflection. The COM+ Services 1.0 Interface   COMAdmin has proven to have several issues and areas of improvement where changes would simplify the customers lives.  Therefore, sticking directly with this interface would not meet the requirements for the configuration API.  This does not mean that some of the structure of the COMAdmin Interface should not carry forward.  It simply means that the COMAdmin interface can be valuable as a guiding piece for a new interface, but will not be the interface itself. The SQL Server 7.0 Interface (SQL-DMO) was discussed briefly.  The SQL Server team has a rough plan to expose it s configuration through WMI in version 8.0 (two releases away).  It is a rough plan since they have had no time to research what it really means.  Based on this feedback, further research on the SQL Server API was deemed not necessary. This leaves WMI or a New API based on the COMAdmin API to be discussed.  There are several technical reasons why the current shipping WMI will not meet the needs of the configuration API.  Those are addressed below.  There are also some concerns about the WMI interface, also listed below.  It is the current plan to begin development of the new managed code API (currently being called ASCI for Application Server Configuration Interface).  At the same time we will continue to work with the WMI team to bring their model and our model into common ground.  This means eventually we can either provide a WMI provider along side our configuration API or we can target the WMI as the main configuration interface for Application Server. WMI should explore addressing some of the functional issues noted below.  This would be of value to all WMI customers and makes eventual convergence more possible.  WMI should also explore the URT programming model and look at managed code classes as the basis for future interfaces. WMI Review WMI Benefits: Standard Configuration Administration API Users who know how to administer for instance, printers using WMI can use the same knowledge and code to administer the Application Server. Extending AS configuration objects Allows the Application Server configuration objects to become extensible by other WMI providers.  Thus a provider could add on properties or associate with for instance, the Application Server s URL objects. AS configuration objects extending other objects Allows the Application Server configuration objects to extend or associate with other provider objects.  For instance, the Application Server configuration machine object could tie to the generic machine object.  Thus providing a grouping of settings that can be performed on a machine. Heterogeneous querying of different objects. Allows WMI users to query over Application Server configuration data in conjunction with other objects configuration data. Common data model between Events/Monitoring and Configuration If we exposed the Application Server configuration objects through WMI it would provide a common data model between the configuration data and the eventing and monitoring model.  It should be noted that even if the configuration data was not exposed through WMI, Application Server could still plug into WMI for unification of monitoring systems with other MS products. WMI Technical issues to be addressed: Managed Code WMI does not currently have plans to expose itself through Managed Code.  While there is a possibility of having the WMI team provide a Managed Code wrapper above the current WMI interfaces, this may not be the optimal solution for Managed Code clients.  Since some of the WMI clients are lower level operating system components converting the WMI layer to managed code may not be the correct path for it. Application Server 2.0 UI configuration tools plan to target managed code which means that providing the administration interfaces which the UI tools use are written in managed code it will be all that easier for the UI tools.  Also providing the administration interfaces in managed code is a show of support to the URT programming model that we will be asking the world to accept and use. Client side caching Currently WMI client code brings across objects as the client asks for them.  VB clients can only enumerate through one object at a time.  This means that each object is a network round trip.  This is not acceptable for the Application Server configuration.  The application server configuration requires that a full collection of objects be able to be marshaled to the client at once. Batch updating Currently in WMI all updates are handled object by object.  The Application Server configuration requires that you be able to send back a batch (actually the whole collection) of updates at one time. WMI Infrastructure verse Catalog Server Infrastructure Currently WMI has a piece of client code that calls out to a WMI Process that either calls out to a WMI provider or loads the WMI provider in process with it.  The Catalog Server infrastructure has the configuration API running in process with the client and has the Catalog Server running in it s own process.  If these two models are used together, it will take two process jumps for every server request.  Client side logic The current Catalog Server infrastructure allows for both basic and complex property edit rules to be handled on the client side before returning that data to the server.  It also allows for edit rules to be handled on the server side.  Some form of edit rule expression must be present in WMI.  The degree to which this is done is still under investigation. WMI Concerns to be addressed: Usability / Magic Strings All generic object interfaces tend to have a number of  Magic Strings  used to request objects take on specific types.  For instance in COM+ the COMAdminCatalogCollection object can represent different Collections (two examples being, Components and Applications).  To insure usability WMI needs to provide a means for user programming to the interface to quickly identify the objects and key words or strings they will need for those objects.  WMI does have some UI tools that should full-fill this, but I have yet to see them work correctly to be able to guarantee that it makes understanding the strings the user needs to supply in code to get at data, user-friendly.    VB Statement completion. The application server configuration should take advantage of statement completion whenever possible.  Current COMAdmin code can not do this because our objects are generic and just represent the specific objects instead of being different objects.  There has been some talk of building type-libraries or specific objects over the generic objects to enable this.  How WMI will handle this issue needs to be understood. Concerns still under investigation VC versus VBA Coding How much more complex is the VC code when users code indirectly through the WMI interface?  How much more overhead is added on making method calls that may not be there if the user was coding directly to an interface created for those method calls?  Right now because of COMAdmin s use of returning IDispatch objects, COMAdmin makes the VC life harder than it should.  Application Server should not increase this issue.  (This will be settled by the sample WMI code that matches the sample ASCI code we have) Predefined Set of Queries WMI exposes views that should allow the AS configuration users to choose a specific query from a set queries and provide the keys for the query without allowing users to pass random queries.  It needs to be researched how these queries or views (most likely views) will appear to the users and how they will be implemented.  It also needs to be researched how views are discoverable to the users for usability issues. Security How the identity of the user gets to the Catalog Server, using WMI will need to be understood in order to make sure the Catalog Server security would be in tack.  There will also be other changes coming to the security model that will need to be understood and how those changes work with WMI.   Application Server will use the URT security model based on roles and capabilities.  This will provide code-access security and different security config for different instances within the data model.  IE: Application Server will want to be able to set up declarative security on a per application basis Schema upgrades causing existing code to break. Apparently it is very difficult to update the standard schema.  For instance, when SMS 2.0 was shipped, they replace the WMI on all SMS machines and replace the schema with a new version.  Therefore, if a customer had a working WMI application, it would need to be reinstalled.  It would be like when MS upgrades an O/S if they replaced the registry with a new one and all the previous registry data was lost.  We really need to understand this more.  It should not affect our data since out data will be in RegDB, but it may affect us in other ways (eventing, monitoring, registration of objects).  This needs to be drill down on with WMI. No isolation between providers.  Providers can run  in-process  with WMI, so if one badly behaving provider crashes it can take down all of WMI.  This should be researched to discover how likely this behavior will be and if the system does go down, what problems for our configuration data will be seen. WMI platform versions are incompatible with each other.  Providers may need to be different between Win95, Win98, NT 4, etc.  The AS team needs to understand this more.  It could be an issue if the AS team is going to have to do different versions for different platforms. Performance WMI performance for reading and writing data will need to be benchmarked.

While this is a highly desirable feature for applications for which  headless  operation is critical, it does present new challenges.  In particular, because users can enter text free-form into the configuration file a wide variety of errors need to be considered to insure that users understand the error and can identify its source and the system can proceed as best it can.  This document describes configuration system error reporting requirements. Error Reporting Goals Identification: Identify where the offending text is If possible, describe what steps need to be taken to correct the error Pass detailed errors back to the caller All error strings will begin with  Line %d1, Char %d2:  where d1 is the # of lines into the configuration file with the error and d2 is the # of characters into the line at question. System actions: Continue loading configuration and collect list of detailed errors until a critical error is encountered Report back to caller that an error occurred and whether it s possible to continue or not (critical == cannot continue, non-critical == processing can continue) Error Reporting Non-Goals Recovery from catastrophic errors Error Conditions Configuration Text Parsing Errors Invalid XML When invalid XML syntax is encountered, processing cannot continue.  Send details of what token was found and what token was expected in addition to line and char counts to caller.  A critical error is returned to the caller. Error Message: Invalid XML syntax.  Found %s expected %s XML Error: <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"? XML Corrected: <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"> Internal Configuration Error Either when the DOM parse succeeds but Node Factory fails or there is an internal fast cache error, we will report this as an  internal configuration error .  This is a critical error condition. Error Message: Internal error while reading configuration.  Last successfully processed node was <%s> Configuration Logical Errors Ambiguous Binary Data This happens when a property typed as BINARY_METADATA has an odd number of characters (i.e.. SomeSecureProperty="DB6").  This value cannot be represented as a single type; but it is ambiguous to treat it as two bytes: should it be "0DB6" or "DB60".   Because this is a property in error processing can continue. A non-critical error is returned to the caller. Error Message: Processing of the %s property is ambiguous, it will be skipped.  An odd number of characters were specified for a binary data value. XML Error: <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"? XML Corrected: <MetaData xmlns="x-schema:CatMeta.xms"> Element found does not match enumeration group list An invalid keytype element is specified.  This fact should be recorded and a non-critical error returned to the caller.   When listing legal values, include up to 80 chars and append   if there is data beyond 80 characters. Error Message: Element found (%s) does NOT match the defined list of legal values.  Legal values include: %s Custom element found not under a parent node Custom elements MUST appear beneath the parent keytype element.  This is required because otherwise we won't have a Location filled in. Return non-critical error to caller. Error Message: Custom  elements must be expressed in XML with a parent node." Missing location attribute The only attribute that is REQUIRED on a keytype element, is the location.  Without it we can't create legal property rows.  This is a non-critical error. Error Message: "No Location attribute found on node %s Undefined Attribute found Attributes must be found in the name table.  We will ignore undefined attributes, but will record the presence of an undefined attribute and return a non-critical error to the caller.  This may be common if someone is updating the schema but the schema doesn't get propagated to the Metabase XML interceptor.   Error Message: "Ignoring undefined attribute (%s) Custom element expected The only element allowed to follow a keytype element is a custom element.  When a non-custom element is found following a keytype element we record this fact and ignore the unknown element.  Return a non-critical error to the caller. Error Message: Only  Custom  elements are allowed as a child at this location.  %s will be ignored. ID on Custom property does not match Well-Known property s ID. It is legal to specify an ID on a Custom property.  It is even legal to specify a Well-Known property's ID when listed as a Custom property.  But it is not OK to specify an ID that doesn't match the Well-Known property's ID.  Log it the details of the error and return a non-critical error to the caller. Error Message: This  Custom  property has a mismatching ID and Name.  Ignoring this element Missing ID on Custom Element This happens when a Custom property is specified, the name doesn't match a Well-Known name, and an ID is NOT specified.  Since all properties must have an ID, this property will be ignored.  Record the details of the error and return a non-critical error to the caller. Error Message: This  Custom  element requires an 'ID' attribute. Ignoring this element" Missing Type on Custom Property A Custom property that is not Well-Known must have a valid Type.  A String type will be assumed, the property will NOT be ignored.  Record details of the error and return a non-critical error to the caller. Error Message: A Custom property (%s) was found at line %d, char %d but contained no Type attribute. Defaulting to String type and continuing" Custom property ID matches Well-Known property ID If an ID is specified for a Custom property that is NOT Well-Known, and the ID matches a Well-Known property's ID we will ignore the property.  Record error details and return a non-critical error to the caller Error Message: A Custom property (%s) was found at line %d, char %d with an ID that matches a Well-Known property s ID. Ignoring the custom property." Configuration File Errors Unable to open file (file is write locked) If the system is unable to open a configuration file for reading this is a non-continuable error.  Record the details of the file and path along with corrective action needed.  Return a critical error to the caller. Error Message: The %s configuration file could not be opened for reading.  The file is write locked by the %s (user/process/resource).  Release the lock to make the file available for reading. Unable to open file (file is not found) If the system is unable to find a specified configuration file this is a non-continuable error.  Record the details of the error including the file and path along with corrective action needed.  Return a critical error to the caller. Error Message: The %s configuration file could not be found.  Restore the configuration file or correct the name of the configuration file being requested. Unable to write file (file is read only) When writing configuration settings back to the file, if the file is in a read-only state record this critical error.  Return a critical error to the caller. Error Message: Error writing to configuration file %s.  Make sure the file is write accessible. Unable to write file (file is write locked by another process) When writing configuration settings back to the file, if the file is in a read only state record this error and fail.  Include the file and path along with corrective action needed.  Return a critical error to the caller. Error Message: The %s configuration file could not be accessed for writing.  Process %s has locked the file.  Release this lock to make the file available for writing. Error Processing The caller of the underlying configuration system is responsible for testing the return value of each call to check for success or failure.  When a failure condition is detected the caller evaluates the  context  of the error and takes the appropriate action.   Upon the detection of an error condition, the caller can further interrogate the error details to determine if the error was non-critical or critical.  In addition, a count and list of detailed error information is available. For each detailed error the following information will be available to the caller: Error Description (as described above as the  error message Error Date Error Time Source Category Event Computer Binary data (this is for future exploitation as NT Event Log supports Binary data)  In addition to the above fields (which map to the NT Event Log, the following information may be provided: Error Code (HResult) OMARKO: Stephen   I need examples of each of the following: Interceptor type   Config DLL   Operation type Table Column Binary data (this is for future exploitation as NT Event Log supports Binary data)  Error output locations If the caller is an application with UI, it may be sufficient to display an error dialog box informing the user of the error interactive application.  For most server applications  All configuration log notifications are written to three locations: 1. NT Event Log; 2. Text based error log and 3. WMI. NT Event Log Justification for writing to the NT Event Log is to provide consistency for current IIS and Windows 2000 administrators and to support legacy management support tools that look in this location for system events. Events are written to the NT Application Event Log.  They include a type, date, time, source, Category, Event #, User and Computer, in addition to a description.   Type: Information, Warning, Error Source: Configuration System Category: Parsing Error, Logical Error, File Error Event: unique event number for each event Description: as defined by  error message  of the event Text base error log Justification for writing to a text based error log is to facilitate  headless  administration of servers.  Telnet and scripting clients will be able to much more easily manipulate a clear text based log.   To make the text based log easy to parse and process, text base log entries are based on XML IST formatted file.  The format for the text based log mirrors the NT event.  The location of the Text based error log is configurable.  The size of the log is also configurable. The file is Unicode.  The error file location is configurable by the caller.  It defaults to %WINNT% if not specified.  The size defaults to unlimited. OMARKO: Stephen has proposed embedding some of these properties (FilePosition, LineNumber, etc ) into the Description tag .  I ve called them out as separate tags in this spec to get additional perspectives.  There are interesting programmatic opportunities for the Caller of config to do things with info like Line# (such as open the file in error and position the cursor there).

Reasons for this would include: Write lock on the file (someone is editing the file) File marked read-only (perhaps an inadvertent attribute update after a backup) Disk full In each case we will attempt to record an error in the NT event log.  Error Message: Unable to write to error log %s.  + reason for the error (Write lock, read-only, disk full). WMI Events In the current version of the config system, WMI instrumentation is not a requirement.  However, succeeding versions will need to be instrumented to make the administration and monitoring of IIS and other systems exploiting the config system manageable by the next generation of tools that look to WMI events rather than the NT Event log for management information.  To aid in the design of wrappers that may be writing to emit events, an excerpt from the WMI cookbook is included below with regard to Error Reporting: Logging and error messages Use unique and consistent identifiers You need to ensure that the source and event identifier pairs used in your feature are unique across Microsoft products and that the IDs for specific issues do not change from version to version. Customers are often forced to update their monitoring processes and tools with every upgrade because the IDs they tracked changed. Benefits Of all the problems with events that customers complain about, the one that upsets them the most is clarity and consistency of events that are generated. A real-world example from one of our largest customers: a customer spent six months working with Microsoft PSS to tie event IDs to specific problems. The customer modified the processes and tools across the entire company to monitor for the specific event IDs. Then the customer installed an additional Microsoft product that generated duplicate IDs. And, when the customer upgraded the original feature, it had changed all the event IDs that the customer was monitoring. Situations like this decrease the overall manageability of Microsoft products as well as customer satisfaction.

Click Guidelines>Messages and read through the section on event logs for more details. Include a URL to PSS information in every event In Whistler, you should append a URL to the current error messages in the message-dll. You should include the generic URL that points to the Online Support redirector page, but based on the parameters you pass to the event log, the URL will redirect to more specific information on the Web, such as KB articles. Benefits Customers regularly complain that Microsoft doesn t document events well enough. They often find events cryptic and say they need a translator to understand them. Customers want to understand what is wrong with their systems, and the events rarely provide information on how to resolve their problems. By linking to PSS information on the Web, you give customers access to the latest troubleshooting information. How to implement For information on how to append a URL, see Linking Event Logged Messages to the Web at   HYPERLINK "http://stweb/Initiatives/WebExtendedContent/EventLogURL.htm"  http://stweb/Initiatives/WebExtendedContent/EventLogURL.htm Meet error message guidelines available on http://uitext  In general, you should display error messages only if something has happened either that users need to act on or that has serious consequences to their work. Messages should be short, simple, clear, specific, and helpful. Often a single error message can be generated by more than one problem. Be certain that your error messages can be traced back to a specific issue. If the message can apply to several situations, you should replace the generic error message with additional, more specific messages. Avoid including more than two to three lines of instructions in error messages because users cannot remember the instructions after the message closes. If you need to provide more detail, include a Help button instead. Contact the lashdir alias to have a Help topic written for your error message.

Click Guidelines>Messages and read through the following sections: Capitalization and Punctuation  Presentation  Terminology  Event Logs Error Handling OMARKO: I m really out on a limb on this one   please let me know how we REALLY do this Mechanism To provide rich error information to the caller, configuration will support returning multiple errors.  This will be done via simple table.  Each interceptor that supports this rich error information will implement the IConfigError interface. [local] interface IConfigError HRESULT GetErrorTable([out] LPVOID* o_ppvSimpleTable); The table returned has the following meta: <DatabaseMeta InternalName="ERRORS"> <ServerWiring Interceptor="Core_DetailedErrorInterceptor"/> <Collection InternalName="DETAILEDERRORS"           PublicName="DetailedErrors" MetaFlags="INTERNAL NOLISTENING"> <Property InternalName="ErrorID" Type="UI4" MetaFlags="NOTPERSISTABLE PRIMARYKEY INSERTGENERATE"/> <Property InternalName="Description" Type="WSTR" MetaFlags="NOTNULLABLE"/> <Property InternalName="Date" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="Time" Type="WSTR"     /> <Property InternalName="Source" Type="WSTR" MetaFlags="NOTNULLABLE" Default="COM+ Config"/> <Property InternalName="Type" Type="UI4" MetaFlags="NOTNULLABLE" Default="ERROR"> <Enum InternalName="SUCCESS" Value="0"/> <Enum InternalName="ERROR" Value="1"/> <Enum InternalName="WARNING" Value="2"/> <Enum InternalName="INFORMATION" Value="4"/> <Enum InternalName="AUDIT_SUCCESS" Value="8"/> <Enum InternalName="AUDIT_FAILURE" Value="16"/> </Property> <Property InternalName="Category" Type="UI4"/> <Property InternalName="User" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="Computer" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="Data" Type="BYTES"/> <Property InternalName="Event" Type="UI4" MetaFlags="NOTNULLABLE"/> <Property InternalName="String1" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="String2" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="String3" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="String4 Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="ErrorCode" Type="UI4"/> <Property InternalName="Interceptor" Type="UI4"/> <Property InternalName="InterceptorSource" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="OperationType" Type="UI4" DefaultValue="Unspecified"> <Enum InternalName="Unspecified" Value="0"/> <Enum InternalName="Populate" Value="1"/> <Enum InternalName="UpdateStore" Value="2"/> </Property> <Property InternalName="Table" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="ConfigurationSource" Type="WSTR"/> <Property InternalName="Row" Type="UI4"/> <Property InternalName="Column" Type="UI4"/> </Collection> </DatabaseMeta> Since the upper layers know more about the context in which errors happen, it is the responsibility of the caller to persist these errors to the Event Log and/or an XML file.  This is achieved by the caller getting the IST pointer to the DetailedErrors table and then calling UpdateStore. This approach gives the caller an opportunity to modify the information in an error row by calling AddRowForUpdate.  Also, the caller may choose to discard the DetailedErrors table in favor of creating their own DetailedErrors table combining context information and the lower layers DetailedErrors. 5.2 DetailedError Column Descriptions ErrorID Generated unique ID used as a PrimaryKey.  This is required to identify a row within the table.  This value is NOT persisted to disk.. Description This is the combination of the string from the MC file (denoted by the Event column) with the row data contained in all columns after the Event column. The date the error row was added to the cache.  When viewed from the NT Event Log, this is the date the entry was added to the Event Log. The time the error row was added to the cache. .  When viewed from the NT Event Log, this is the time the entry was added to the Event Log. Source This is the Source as specified in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Event Log\Source One of the enum values listed above. Category Any user specified numeric value. The NT user account that caused the error.  This is often  Computer The computer name where the error occurred. Any binary data the might be useful in identifying the source of the error.  This is accessible from the Event Viewer. Event The Event corresponds to the MC file s MessageID.  This is what maps the formatting string that gets reported in the Description field. String1 User defined string which gets mapped to   format specifier in the format string from the MC entry. String2 User defined string which gets mapped to   format specifier in the format string from the MC entry. String3 User defined string which gets mapped to   format specifier in the format string from the MC entry. String4 User defined string which gets mapped to   format specifier in the format string from the MC entry. ErrorCode An optional HRESULT. Interceptor Numeric Interceptor ID. InterceptorSource DLL file from which the error originated. OperationType OperationType enum (usually Populate or UpdateStore). Table Table name that caused the error. ConfigurationSource Usually the filename from which the configuration data is stored.  Can also be a string description of the store (example  Fixed Table Heap This can either refer to the Row within the cache (in the case of the error occurring on UpdateStore) or the Row within the store (as in Line number or equivilent). Column This can either refer to the Column within the cache (in the case of the error occurring on UpdateStore) or the Column within the store (as in Line position or equivilent). Each DetailedError row corresponds to an entry (Event) in the Source s MC file.  The entry in the MC file must contain format specifiers for exactly five strings.  The first four are filled with the columns: String1, String2, String3, String4.  The fifth string is a concatenation of each of the column public names (for columns following String4) followed by a colon, the column value, and a newline character. Example MC file entry: MessageId=0x10FF Severity=Error Facility=Runtime SymbolicName=IDS_COMCAT_XML_LOGIC_FAILURE Language=English The XML File contains a logical error.  Enum value   is not found in the TagMeta for Table   / Column  .  Element is as follows:%4 %5%0 Example DetailedError Row: ErrorID Description The XML File contains a logical error.

Date and Time may not match exactly since the Date and Time in the IST is generated at the time the row is added to the DetailedErrors table; but the Date and Time in the NT Event Log get generated when the event is added to the Event Log. All columns in the DetailedErrors table (except the ErrorID, I m not sure about it yet) get persisted to the Config Event Log XML file. GetDetailedErrorCount / GetDetailedError. We will extend the STError as defined in the following structure: struct STError2: public STError{ LPWSTR FileName; LPWSTR ErrorMessage; ULONG Line; ULONG Column; DWORD ExtendedErrorInfoType; LPVOID ExtendedErrorInfo; // could contain the bad data in the row STEPHEN::  How about we return an E_DETAILED_ERROR_IST, and the caller can get an IST to these errors?  This would need some thought. Persistence Because configuration system will be called by a background service, in order for the administrative UI to be able to report errors to the user it will need access to error information.  It s not appropriate to parse the eventlog for this purpose, so we will have to persist the errors in as a collection in a persisted cache. Application specific issues OMARKO: Because most of the error conditions are already covered in the previous configuration section, IIS specific configuration boils down to these top-level issues.  What am I missing? IIS Configuration Location and size of Text based error log The text based error log will be stored in the %INETSRV% directory and the file name is metabase.log.  The size of the file defaults to 1 MB max.  Critical read errors When a critical error is received while reading configuration data, the IIS configuration system will attempt to recover by reading the most current backup metabase.xml file.  IIS configuration will write an error to the event log indicating backup was used. Error Message: IIS can not read metabase.xml, defaulting to latest backed-up version.  The current metabase.xml file will be copied to the Errors directory and will be replaced with the backup. Critical write errors When a critical error is received while saving configuration data, the IIS configuration system will attempt to save to the backup directory.  IIS configuration will write an error to the event log indicating backup was used.  This will be typically due to a write locked or read only attribute on the file. Error Message: IIS can not save the current config to the metabase.xml file.  A backup of this file (%s) was saved to the backup directory.  Release write lock or read-only attribute on the metabase.xml file to permit update. Critical write errors (can t write backup) In the case the backup file cannot be written, this event must be logged.  This could happen if there is insufficient space on the hard drive or the backup directory has incorrect access permissions. Error Message: IIS can not write the backup configuration file to the backup directory (%s).  Verify space exists on this drive and that access permissions exist on the directory.

By extending the schema, either via ADSI, WMI or via text entry into the mbschema.xml file, end-user configuration data can be represented as well-known properties in the Metabase (metabase.xml by default). Supported  This section notes the supported extensions that can be made. Changes to schema that is part of the shipped system is not allowed, however, it is permitted to make schema extensions that include adding, modifying and deleting shipped properties as long as those shipped properties were not originally defined as being on that class in the shipped schema.  For example, the <IIsFilter > class does not define the property AccessFlags that is part of the shipped schema under the <IisWebVirtualDir> class.  A legal schema extension would be to add the AccessFlags property to the IisFilter class.  An illegal schema extension would be to remove the AccessFlags property from the <IisWebVirtualDir> node. Users can add, delete, and modify user defined classes and properties. Class and property names must be legal xml element and attribute names respectively. Property definitions may only appear in the main class: all other classes can only contain property references. ADSI will continue to read and write schema using the metabase. Unsupported Schema extensions these changes CANNOT include deleting or altering shipped schema. Schema XML will not use XSD as it is far from ready for prime time. Editing of the mbschema.xml file while IIS is running is not supported. The former "/schema" nodes in metabase.xml file is not supported and any attempts to add it by editing the file will be discarded. Non-schema data added to "/schema" in the in-memory metabase is not supported and discarded.  This could only be done via the base object APIs.  ADSI and WMI will enforce this rule.  Examples of non-schema data are <VARSHAJ/STEPHEN?>. If someone is edit-while-running a property/class defined in extended schema, and at the same time someone else deletes the property/class from the schema, that particular edit-while-running change won't be accepted and the problem will be logged (this eliminates the need to retain and difference against a version-specific schema for edit while running). File versioning The current state/version of the schema will be stored in the metabase.  A global metabase key will reflect the current mbschema.xml files date/time stamp.  Another global metabase key will reflect if the metabase is extended.  New key names: SchemaDate, a string containing a hash of the date/time of the schema file SchemaExtended, Boolean, defaults to FALSE, set to TRUE when schema extensions are detected.  This key is used to optimize out the compile step if no schema extensions exist. Implementation Shipped Schema definition / location iismeta.xml is the master copy of IIS shipped schema, checked into catalog sources. At build time, iismeta.xml schema is compiled into iiscfg.dll. IIS shipped schema can be accessed from iiscfg.dll via the IIS shipped schema database (via the schema .dll interceptor).  <STEPHEN/VARSHA   what is the name of this DLL?> Schema updates The in-memory metabase tracks whether or not any changes (usually via ADSI) have occurred to the /schema tree. During SaveAllData, if any changes were made to the in-memory /schema tree, the following happens: The /schema is written to a mbschema.xml file atomically. The schema compilation process is invoked. When complete, the newly compiled schema is read and used to finish saving metabase data. Edit while running is NOT supported on the mbschema.xml file.  Any changes made to the file while IIS is running will be ignored and possibly overwritten if schema changes occur.   Changes to the mbschema.xml file are only picked up at IIS startup. Schema compilation A mbschema.bin file exists which is a merge of the IIS shipped schema in iiscfg.dll and the schema extensions in mbschema.xml The schema compilation process works as follows: The iis shipped schema database is read from iiscfg.dll A new mbschema.bin file is created into which is dumped the IIS shipped schema. The mbschema.xml file is read, and any classes or properties not already in mbschema.bin are added A new mbschema.xml is written according to the complete schema in mbschema.bin The date-timestamp of the mbschema.xml is recorded in metabase.xml Reading the schema  The complete IIS schema can be read from mbschema.bin via the IIS extended schema database (via a schema .bin interceptor) During ReadAllData: If the mbschema.xml exists and is unchanged, we load the /schema tree from mbschema.bin. If the mbschema.xml has been changed, or doesn't exist, we invoke the schema compilation process. We use the latest compiled schema to read metabase.xml. Setup Currently setup does a full replacement of the /schema tree in the metabase.xml file by registering a DLL that which takes the contents of the globdata.cxx source file and uses it as the definition of the /schema tree. Changes need to setup: In IIS6, we will need to preserve legal schema extensions that users may have made via ADSI in IIS 5.0.  The work to identify and migrate extensions will be done by the metabase code   setup will just need to stop populating the /schema tree in the metabase.xml file. Upgrade scenario When IIS starts-up the first time, the metabase code will detect that no metabase.xml file exists. It will read the existing metabase.bin file and mark the /schema tree as changed.  On saving the metabase, the metabase.xml and mbschema.xml file will be generated.  Then the schema verification and compilation process will begin.  This will preserve the legal schema extensions present on the machine being upgraded. Clean Install scenario: If no metabase.bin or metabase.xml file exists setup will need to write a default metabase.xml file.  Upon saving the metabase for the first time, the schema verification and compilation process will detect the absence of the mbschema.xml file and automatically generate it. Backup / Restore The mbschema.xml will always be copied along with the metabase.xml on backup, restore, and history.   Metabase Backup will copy the current mbschema.xml file along with the current metabase.xml file.  Restore will restore both corresponding files. In the History directory, each metabase.xml.<major version>.<minor version> will have a corresponding mbschema.xml.<majorversion>.<minor version>.  When history files are restored, both the metabase and mbschema of matching versions must be restored. Optimization Only build and use mbschema.bin when schema extensions exist Change History Changes 9/18/00 Created Omar Kouatly 10/21/00 Incorporate feedback from Janaina Omar Kouatly 11/24/00 Update Backup/Restore Omar Kouatly Rejected Topics This section of the specification lists topics that were considered but the team has rejected.

Introduction Many URT configuration scenarios require that one or more attributes of a specific entity be calculated from multiple source files with different merging semantics. Common semantics include inheritance along a hierarchy (i.e. machine -> site -> application -> directory -> file) and overlaying developer specified, immutable attributes with configuration information. This document outlines how such a merge can be implemented within the catalog framework. Refer to the Project 42 Administrative Framework specification for more information. Container Types A container is a physical store of configuration information. In the URT, most (all?) configuration information is stored in containers that are XML files. A container can store attributes for one or more logical entities.  For a given container, it is a requirement to be able to limit the entities for which attributes can be specified in the container. It is also a requirement to be able to limit the set of attributes within a specific entity that can be specified in a container. Another requirement is the ability to change the semantics of an attribute in a container.  To satisfy these requirements, we introduce the notion of a container type. A container type defines the set of entities and attributes that are allowed in a container of that type. Container Types are defined as part of the catalog schema information and are as such inherently extensible. Do we want to expose the ability to add new container types in URT1? Container Type Hierarchy A further requirement is the ability to group containers into a hierarchy. The hierarchy is often driven by the need to delegate and scope administration of attributes. For example, a machine administrator, one or more site administrators and one or more application administrator may each have permission to specify certain attributes for certain entities. Giving each of these administrators a dedicated container improves security and system robustness. We establish the container hierarchy by establishing a hierarchy of container types. Part of a container type s definition is the set of child container types that can be configured in it.  One or more container types are designated as root container types, by the fact that no other container type claims to be their parent. Like container types, container type hierarchy is defined as part of the catalog s schema information. Should we expose the ability to add/change the container type hierarchy? Determining Child Containers A container specifies the location of each of is child container types in the form of a  container search path . A container search path contains an unordered sequence of relative or absolute UNC paths, which can point to specific files, specific directories or entire directory hierarchies (wildcard, recursion/recursion depth). Should we allow full regular expressions here? Should the path be ordered? Each child container type has it s own, configurable container search path. Root container types designate a container search path as part of the container type definition. Should we allow default containers to be configured for any container type? This has been proposed to enable container templates and policy Typically (by default) every container has exactly one type. For more complex scenarios, it is possible for an administrator to configure a single, physical container to have more than one container type, by simply including it in more than one container search path. In the 8/2/99 catalog drop, containers that are to participate in the cook down process are limited to carry attributes for at most one logical entity (attributes for other entities will be ignored (= not cooked down). Example: Ducttape/XSP hierarchy Container Type Parent Containers Entities Machine Machine Application Pool Machine Application Pool Site Definition Machine Site Configuration Site Definition Application Definition Site Definition Application Application Configuration Application Definition Application Directory Application Configuration Directory File Configuration (?)

Hierarchy Interceptors Hierarchy interceptors encapsulate the knowledge about the hierarchy of configuration files for a specific host environment. They compute the physical location of configuration files and enable reuse of merge interceptors for different host environments. Hierarchy interceptors take a ConfigType and Selector as input, and transform it into a new, compound Selector. This new selector is a list of selectors whose elements represent individual configuration collections along the hierarchy, which contribute to a single configuration collection. Typically the configuration manager interprets this list selector and incrementally invokes a merge interceptor on pairs of configuration collections (see Section   REF _Ref465752259 \r \p \h  3 below  for details). The configuration manager assumes that the elements of the list are UrlUncSelectors:  class System.Config.UrlUncSelector : System.Config.Selector public UrlUncSelector(String); // syntax: urlunc:[<urlselector>;<uncselector>] public UrlUncSelector(Selector UrlInit, Selector UncInit); public Selector Url {get, set}; public Selector Unc {get, set}; The Selector.Url member indicates the logical name for a node in the hierarchy (i.e. the name by which the merged configuration information for the name can be queried). The Selector.Unc member indicates the physical location from which the raw source configuration information for the node can be retrieved. Web Server Hierarchy The web server hierarchy starts with a single root node, the machine configuration. The machine configuration (currently \complus\config\machine.cfg) defines a set of sites (among other machine wide configuration information), and their bindings into the URL namespace. Each site definition establishes a root directory for the site, in which further configuration information resides. The site root directory contains a configuration file (currently  config.cfg ). The configuration information in this configuration file is typically considered to be associated with the URL(s) of the site. Child directories of the site root directory are typically mapped into the URL namespace by appending the relative path of the child directory to its parent s URL. The configuration file can contain configuration that map an immediate child URL to a different directory in the file system; these instructions are called virtual directories (or VDIRs). Any child directory under the site root directory can contain additional configuration files ( config.cfg ), which typically establish configuration associated with the URL corresponding to the child directory. Machine (via Site root dir) => App/Dir (via subdir/VDIR=> App/Dir (via subdir/VDIR) => App/Dir =>  Example: SiteDef 1:  http://ms.com, root dir: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms Root app URL: http://ms.com Child app 1: http://ms.com/foo Child app 2: http://ms.com/foo/bar Child app 3: http://ms.com/zee, mapped to VDIR d:\zee SiteDef 2: http://hotmail.com, root dir: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\hotmail Root app URL: http://hotmail.com Child app 4: http://hotmail.com/foo How do we handle config info for a child node declared in a parent config file? Web Server Hierarchy Interceptor The Web Server Hierarchy Interceptor (WSH) takes a ConfigType and a URLSelector (with  http: https:  protocol prefix) and turns it into a selector (list selector) consisting of  a parent UrlSelector, for which the configuration is already known (cached), a list of child UrlUncSelectors, indicating the URL of each node and the file system path of each configuration file along the URL hierarchy.  If the incoming URL corresponds to the root of a site (i.e. is of the form  http://<servername> ), the WSH generates a list selector indicating the site definition and the site root configuration file: Examples: ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://ms.com list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\complus\config\machine.cfg];      urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\config.cfg] ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://hotmail.com list:urlunc:[http://hotmail.com;file://c:\complus\config\machine.cfg];      urlunc:[http://hotmail.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\hotmail] If the incoming URL is a child URL of a site (i.e. is of the form  http://<servername>/<child> ), the WSH generates a list selector indicating the first URL for which config information is already cached (or the sitedef as above if no info has been cached yet), and the locations of the child configuration files. Examples: ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://ms.com/foo If config for site root URL has been cached: list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file:\\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\config.cfg];      urlunc:[http://ms.com/foo;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\foo] If this is the first request: list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file:\\c:\complus\config\machine.cfg];      urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms];      urlunc:[http://ms.com/foo;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\foo] Assuming parent config has been cached for each of the subsequent requests: ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://ms.com/foo/bar list:urlunc:[http://ms.com/foo;  HYPERLINK "file://c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ms\\foo"  file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\foo      urlunc:[http://ms.com/foo/bar;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\foo\bar] ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://ms.com/zee list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\zee];      urlunc:[http://ms.com/zee;file://d:\zee] ConfigType =  Applications , Selector= http://hotmail.com/foo list:urlunc:[http://hotmail.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\hotmail];      urlunc:[http://hotmail.com/foo;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\hotmail\foo] The WSH computes these selectors by splitting the incoming URL into parent URL and relative child URL (finding the last occurrence of the   character). If the URL can not be split, the WSH reads the site definition for the URL and obtains the site root directory: // RequestURL =  http://ms.com SiteDef=ConfigManager.Get( SiteDefs , RequestURL) ListSelector sel = new ListSelector(   UrlUncSelector(RequestURL,  file: +ConfigManager.GetMachineConfigDirectory(),    UrlUncSelector(RequestURL,  file:// +SiteDef.Path)); list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\complus\config\machine.cfg]; //       urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms] If the URL can be split into parent URL and relative child URL, the WSH determines if the configuration cache contains the config information for the parent URL: // RequestURL =  http://ms.com/zee , ParentURL= http://ms.com , ChildURL= // RequestURL =  http://ms.com/foo , ParentURL= http://ms.com , ChildURL= ConfigManager.IsObjectCached(ConfigType, ParentURL); //  http://ms.com If no info is available, the WSH continues to split the ParentURL until either finding cached info for a URL, or hitting the site root. The WSH then determines the location of the next child node by attempting to read the VDIR definition from the parent URL. If this read fails (no VDIR info defined), it obtains the parent s file system path and appends the relative child URL. It adds the resulting path to the child config file to the list of child paths computed so far: VDir=ConfigManager.Get( VDIRs query:URL= +ParentURL+ ;Child= +ChildURL); query:URL=http://ms.com;Child=zee query:URL=http://ms.com;Child=foo if (VDir) { ChildPaths.Add(UrlUncSelector(ChildUrl, file:// +VDir.Path+ \config.cfg urlunc:[http://ms.com/zee;file://d:\zee\config.cfg] else { Application=ConfigManager.Get( Applications , ParentURL); // Application.Path=c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms ChildPaths.Add(UrlUncSelector(ChildUrl, Application.Path+ +ChildURL+ \config.cfg urlunc:[http://ms.com.zee;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\foo\config.cfg] It then iterates until the entire RequestURL is processed. It creates a list selector containing the the list of child paths: list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\complus\config\machine.cfg];      urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms] list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms];      urlunc:[http://ms.com/zee;file://d:\zee\config.cfg] Assuming ms.com config has not been cached for http://ms.com/zee request: list:urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\complus\config\machine.cfg];      urlunc:[http://ms.com;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms];      urlunc:[http://ms.com/zee;file://c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ms\zee\config.cfg] The WSH returns the list selector to the config manager.  Implementation notes This design avoids the need for recursion on the parent s URL at the cost of making the hierarchy interceptor aware of caching semantics in the config manager (IsObjectCached). The initial creation of config information for a site is triggered by the absence of cached config information for the root URL of the site (the merge coordinater passes in a NULL parent collection). Shell Hierarchy Machine -> User -> Application Browser Hierarchy Machine -> User -> Site/Docbase? Merge Interceptors Merge interceptors encapsulate the knowledge of computing a compound configuration collection based on two underlying configuration collections. They are typically used in conjunction with hierarchical configuration files to implement inheritance semantics from parent to child configuration files. Merge interceptors take two config collections and a selector as input and return a configuration collection.  Merge interceptors can be generic, or they can be optimized for a specific ConfigType. interface System.Config.IConfigMergeInterceptor {   Object Merge(Object parent,  Object Sourcechild,  String ConfigType,  Selector TargetSel,  // Selector of the config object that is to be // computed and returned from this method Selector SourceChildSel, // Selector used to retrieve the sourcechild config object  // not typically used by the interceptor. LevelOfService LoS); The resulting ( merged ) collection often contains additional properties as compared to the  sourceraw  collection retrieved from the config file. A typical property is a URL column that carries the URL of the node to which the config item applies. Another typical property is a URL column indicating the node in which the item was actually defined (= inherited from) ( URLSource  property). Other properties may be obtained by special rules (i.e. Ducttape AppPoolId from AppPoolOverride collection in machine.cfg). Generic merge interceptors (like the ones described below) do not need to compute these properties, but must be prepared to handle different ConfigTypes for parent and child. They assume that parent and returned config objects have the same ConfigType and that their ConfigType is the same type as the ConfigType parameter passed into the Merge method. They also assume that the  merged  config type contains all properties of the  sourceraw  config, in the same order (with the exception of well-known properties like the  Directive  property, which is assumed to be at property index 0). They further assume that any additional properties in the  merged  config type precede the properties from the  sourceraw  config type. Would it be easier to assume that the   properties start at column index 0 and the additional/computed properties follow at the end? Example: Ducttape   and  APPS_cfg  config types This example uses native catalog schema syntax (table=collection, column=property). <TableMeta InternalName="APPS">   <ColumnMeta InternalName="SrcCFGFile" Type="WSTR"     />   <ColumnMeta InternalName="AppURL" Type="WSTR"     MetaFlags="PRIMARYKEY" />   <ColumnMeta InternalName="SiteID" Type="UI4"      MetaFlags="PRIMARYKEY" />   <ColumnMeta InternalName="AppPoolID" Type="WSTR"     />   <ColumnMeta  InternalName="AppEnabled" Type="UI4"      /> </TableMeta> <TableMeta InternalName=" APPS_CFG">   <ColumnMeta  InternalName="AppEnabled" Type="UI4"      /> </TableMeta> Additional properties can be computed by a specialized merge interceptor, but more typically another interceptor is run later in the  Validate  stage and modifies the collection returned by a generic merge interceptor. Specifically, there may be generic  Validate  interceptors that set the URL property of the node. Do we need those for in-memory cached collections or just for persisted caches? How do we make file  coordinates  (XML line number/position) available to merge interceptors and validating interceptors? How do we provide merged vs. unmerged vs. source views of the data? LoS? What about the potentially different schema? Should this be a  native  concept to the config manager? Generic Merge Interceptors The following generic merge interceptors are available for use with newly defined collections. The definer of a new collection simply chooses an appropriate interceptor chain (or chains) that contains a merge interceptor that implements the desired merge semantics for the new collection. Property Override Merge Interceptor class System.Config.Merge.PropertyOverrideMerge : IConfigMergeInterceptor {} The Property Override Merge Interceptor (POM) implements  last writer wins  inheritance semantics (similar to the IIS5 meta-base inheritance semantics). A non-null property in a child config collection simply replaces a property in the parent collection. We may want to add an optional  Final  semantics later Any non-null properties in items in a child collection replace the corresponding property (same name) in the parentcollection. Items in the parent collection are matched by primary key of the child collection. List Append Merge Interceptor class System.Config.Merge.ListAppendMerge : IConfigMergeInterceptor {}  The List Append Interceptor (LAM) simply clones the parent config collection and appends the items in the child collection to the end of the first collection.  List Prepend Merge Interceptor class System.Config.Merge.ListPrependMerge : IConfigMergeInterceptor {}  The List Prepend Interceptor (LPM) is a variation of the List Append Interceptor in that it inserts the items from the child collection before the items in the parent collection.  List Merge Interceptor class System.Config.Merge.ListMerge : IConfigMergeInterceptor {}  The List Merge Interceptor (ListM) can be used to compute a list of items via additions and removals across the node hierarchy.  It allows items to be permanently added and removed (i.e. no subsequent configuration collection can add the item back in or remove it). This functionality is referred to as  AddFinal  and  RemoveFinal A configuration collection can also declare the entire collection as  final , disallowing any additions and removals in subsequent collections. A configuration collection can also clear all previous items in the collection. A good example of a collection that uses ListM is the WIT/XSP ScriptMap collection: the collection is a list of tuples of file extensions and handler module names, i.e. [*.ASP, ASP.DLL],[*.XSP, XSP.DLL]. Any config file across the hierarchy of a node can add a tuple to the list inherited from the parent, remove a tuple from the list, clear the entire list or make an addition/removal from the list final. The ListM relies on the following naming conventions for properties in the collections: SourceRaw Collection If removal of items (or any form of final) is required, the collections that contributes the sourceraw configuration information must contain a directive property as listed below. Of no such property is defined (currently: if the property at index 0 is not of type int or the value is not in the range indicated by the enumeration below), the items in the sourceraw collection are treated as if an   directive had been specified. The collection must define a unique primary key; the list merge interceptor uses the primary key to replace entries that might have been defined in a parentconfiguration collection when an item is added/removed by the child collection. Directive  property The Directive property must at property index 0 and must be an enumeration type with the following values: enum ListMergeDirective { Remove  AddFinal RemoveFinal = 3; // not yet supported  Clear = 4; // any other properties in this item are ignored Final = 5; // any other properties in this item are ignored Later, we need to drive this off of wiring/schema information instead of assuming column 0. If no Directive property is defined (= the type of property 0 is not int) or the value is not in the proper range, the ListM will assume   semantics. Merged Collection If any form of final semantics (AddFinal, RemoveFinal or Final) is required, the resulting merged collection must be able to carry the corresponding information, so that during merge of child nodes the final information is available to the ListM interceptor. For this purpose, the following property must be defined in the merged collection: How do we prevent  RemoveFinal  items to show up in the collection returned to the caller? It would be ugly if the runtimes had to filter this. For now we simply don t support  RemoveFinal Directive  property The Directive property must be at property index 0. It must be an enumeration type with the ListMergeDirective values defined   REF enum_ListMergeDirective \p \h  above . The ListMerge will only write Add, RemoveFinal, AddFinal and Final into the merged collection, to avoid that consumers need to filter out any  Clear RemoveFinal  values A  Clear  directive in the sourceraw collection will be processed by removing the item(s) from the merged collection. A  Remove  directive in the sourceraw collection will be implemented by removing or simply not adding the item to the merged collection. If the directive property is not of the proper type, the ListM will not allow any Final, AddFinal or RemoveFinal directives. Does the ListM need to read the schema to figure out if the  Directive  property is defined? No, for now it just looks at the type of column 0  Need to fix this later. Configuration Manager Implementation Notes The configuration manager invokes a Merge Coordinator Interceptor (MCI) as one of the interceptors in the   stage. This interceptor is special in that  the configuration manager transparently invokes it whenever it finds a merge interceptor in the wiring info it used a different Read method that allows it to add intermediate results to the configuration manager s cache. There is currently no requirement to make the merge coordination itself pluggable. However keeping most of the special logic out of the core config manager enables us to be more flexible in the future.  The MCI uses the list selector that it receives   typically as the output of a hierarchy interceptor - to invoke a merge interceptor. The MCI knows (from the wiring information, which it retrieves from the RequestContext) which merge interceptor to invoke for a given ConfigType. It assumes that the selector being processed is a list interceptor, which contains UrlUncSelectors of a cached parent config node and UrlUncSelectors indicating the child config infos to be merged into the cached config node. The MCI implements the following variation of the IConfigReadInterceptor interface: interface System.Config.IConfigReadInterceptorWithIntermediateResults {  Object Read( String ConfigType, Selector Selector, LevelOfService LoS, Object PreviousConfig, // for chained interceptors: config read by previous // interceptor. NULL for store interceptors RequestContext rq // see below. class System.Config.Interceptors.RequestContext { void ReturnIntermediateResult(String ConfigType, Selector sel); // Used by merge interceptors that process merges of multiple nodes in a single // Read calls: the result for the nodes are treated as if they had been returned // from the Read methods, i.e. the ConfigManager calls Validate interceptors, adds // them to the cache etc. // This is not a public method on the config manager to prevent arbitrary code // from adding invalid/malicious config into the cache. // The config manager also maintains private state for the request in this class // to avoid rereading of this state (Example: Wiring info for the config type). The MCI obtains the cached parent config collection from the cache, using the URL part of the first UrlUncSelector in the list selector. In addition to the parent config collection, the cache entry contains a list of files that have contributed to the config collection. Should the MCI really know about the cache entry? Should the file list be handled inside the RegisterIntermediateResult method in the config manager? Do we need to pass in a file list or do we use a UrlUncSelector? If no cache entry is found for the parent URL, the MCI attempts to Get a config collection for the UNC part of the first UrlUncSelector, first for the merged collection (= requested collection), and if this request fails for the  sourceraw  collection. If both read attempts fail, the MCI fails the read method. The MCI then iterates over the subsequent child UrlUncSelectors, requesting the sourceraw configuration information. The ConfigType to be used for the child config requests selectors in the list selector is different from the requested config type: in many scenarios, that  sourceraw  configuration at a given node has a different schema from the  merged  configuration, i.e. it may not contain the location information in the hierarchy (URL property) or other computed or derived properties. The config manager determines the second  sourceraw  ConfigType by a naming convention: it appends   to the requested ConfigType. The Ducttape   collection for example is generated by reading the sourceraw data from the  APPS_cfg  collection. This should be part of the wiring info. For each child config node, the config manager reads the sourceraw child config collection using the UNC part of the UrlUncSelector, invokes the merge interceptor s Merge method, passing in  the current parent config collection,  the sourceraw child config collection,  the URL part of the UrlUncSelector as the TargetSel parameter and the UNC part of the UrlUncSelector as the ChildSel. The merge interceptor returns a new, merged config collection from the merge interceptor (usually by cloning the (read-only) parent config collection and adding to it). It then adds the merged config collection and the child node s config file path to the config cache, indicating the cache entry corresponding to the parent s node.  The config manager continues iterating over the child nodes by using the obtained child config collection as the new parent config collection. Migration of XSP Config Factories XSP Config Factories typically have the following structure: ConfigurationOutput Create(Object parent, ConfigurationInput input[], String path) { Result=parent.Clone(); // Read config through input (XML cursor) // Merge child config into Result return Result; Migrating a Config Factory to the Config System requires the following steps: Define a schema for the sourceraw config collection (input) and   if different - merged config collection (output). If the standard config collection/item implementations are not sufficient (i.e. custom data structures are required etc.): implement IConfigCollection and/or IConfigItem. Change the method signature from  Create Merge ( Change the Merge method as follows: Object Merge( Object parent, Object child,  String ConfigType, Selector TargetSel, Selector ChildSel LevelOfService LoS) { Result=parent.Clone(); // Read config through input (config collection) // Merge child config into Result return Result; What about the ConfigOutput.Default vs. Local properties? Do we need to support this? For now: either use Final semantics in parent or custom merge interceptor.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft ICatalogErrorLogger Specification TitleICatalogErrorLogger Specification Stephen Rakonza Normal.dot stephenr Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags MonthICatalogErrorLogger Specification Author: Stephenr Date: April 12, 2001 Why is it Needed? There is a need to have an extensible mechanism for logging errors.  One product may choose to log errors to the NT Event Log.  Another may choose to log to a text file.  A third may choose to log to both.  Also  Catalog  code that lives in other DLLs may want to log errors in a way that s consistant with the internal Catalog logging.  ICatalogErrorLogger interface is designed to solve these problem and more. Design Criteria The error logging mechanism does not replace the error table mechanism for returning detailed errors. It is intended as a 'per product' error logging mechanism (not 'per table' or 'per interceptor'). The 'well known' logging mechanisms will not require extra method calls to continue working. The error logging interface should leverage the Error Table. External DLLs should have the ability to replace the error logging mechanism. External DLLs should be able to gain access to the error logging mechanism on a  per product  basis. Changes to the Dispenser The dispenser will have two new methods.  One to associate an ICatalogErrorLogger with the dispenser.  Another to retrieve the error logger interface.  The methods are prototyped as follows: SetCatalogErrorLogger( ICatalogErrorLogger *i_pLogger) GetCatalogErrorLogger( ICatalogErrorLogger **o_ppLogger) Only one logger may be associated with a dispenser.  It is possible to chain Loggers, however.  The caller may GetCatalogErrorLogger, keep a ref count then call SetCatalogErrorLogger.  The new logger could do some processing and then call the original logger.  WARNING:  Care needs to be taken when setting a new logger on the dispenser.  Since the dispenser is a singleton, and multiple thread may be accessing it, undesirable results may occur if the logger is changed in complex scenarios. All errors will be reported to this callback.  If no callback interface is specified a default error logger will be invoked.  For the IIS product, the error logger will log to both the NT Event Log as well as a text file.  For the NetFrameworkv1 product, the error logger will do nothing. External code may take advantage of this interface to log error in a uniform way.  Example, the metabase code that reads from the metabase XML interceptor does extra validation.  A warning may need to be generated when the data is invalid.  This code should get the ICatalogErrorLogger from the dispenser; and log though this interface. IcatalogErrorLogger::ReportError The only method that is supported by ICatalogErrorLogger is ReportError, prototyped as follows: ICatalogErrorLogger::ReportError( ULONG i_BaseVersion_DETAILEDERRORS, ULONG i_ExtendedVersion_DETAILEDERRORS, ULONG i_cDETAILEDERRORS_NumberOfColumns, ULONG * i_acbSizes, LPVOID * i_apvValues) All parameters are input parameters.  None of the data will be modified. The columns refered to are columns of the ErrorTable.  The versions referenced are the versions of the Error Table.  The versions are needed to allow changes to the Error Table and future/backward compatibility.  As columns are added to ErrorTable, the minor version is incremented.  As the meta for an existing column is changed, the major version is incremented. All plugins (read, write & interceptor plugins) must be using a compatible version of the ErrorTable.  This means the major version must match.  When the minor version does not match (but the major version does), there may be minor loss of error information; but compatibility still exists.  If the dispenser invokes an interceptor or plugin that is incompatible (which may happen when the code exists in a separate DLL), and report error is called, it must return E_ST_BADVERSION. Count of columns parameter is needed because not all collumns must be set.  Notice that there is no i_aIndexes to indicate which columns are being set.  This is a departure from IST's tradition.  This is by design to make it easier to implement the ICatalogErrorLogger interface.  Count of columns indicates how many elements are in the i_apvValues array.  It is presumed that the columns are the 0th to the (i_cColumns-1) columns.  The i_acbSizes parameter is required as part of the interface because one of the columns in the Error Table is of type 'bytes'.  Also, this allows for future columns of type 'bytes'.  This parameter may be NULL if no 'bytes' columns are specified in i_apvValues. The caller who builds the i_apvValues array does not have to supply all of the columns in the Error Table.  But a minimal set must be supplied.  This minimal set of columns is defined by the implementation of the ICatalogErrorLogger. In the case of the IIS logger, for BaseVersion zero Error Tables (which is the only version that currently exists) the caller must provide i_cColumns of at least 13; more if any insertion strings are needed.  See the ColumnMeta for  DETAILEDERRORS  table.  Some of these 13 columns may be NULL.  Here is a list of required column:     iDETAILEDERRORS_ErrorID,       iDETAILEDERRORS_Description,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_Date,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_Time,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_SourceModuleName,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_CategoryString,   //required*     iDETAILEDERRORS_MessageString,   //required*     iDETAILEDERRORS_Source,       iDETAILEDERRORS_Type,       iDETAILEDERRORS_Category,       iDETAILEDERRORS_User,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_Computer,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_Data,   //not required     iDETAILEDERRORS_Event,   CategoryString and MessageString are a special case that is NOT required IF the category string and message string are located within the Catalog DLL where the IIS ICatalogErrorLogger exists.  In this case the MessageString is obtained using the Event; and the CatagoryString is obtained from Category. The implementor of this interface may return S_OK if processing is to continue; or a failure code to indicate that processing should halt.  An example of when this would be useful: the XML interceptor encounters a numeric where 'bool' was expected, it calls ReportError indicating a warning; but the callback wants to treat this as an error and stop processing, so in returns E_ST_BADVALUE. This interface allows users the flexibility of being notified as error are encountered; or have the table of errors generated and set in SetErrorInfo.  The latter might be preferred where marshalling is involved. Design Considerations & Limitations This error logging mechanism does not, by itself, solve the problem of two pieces of code from the same product needing two different loggers.  A level of service flag will indicate whether logging is done.  With this level of service flag the caller can log from the Error Table returned via GetErrorInfo.  These two features combine to allow instance granularity in error logging. The error logger should only be set once.  The dispenser is a singleton, share by multiple threads.  The error logger associated with the dispenser should also be a singleton, able to be used by multiple threads.  The caller may choose to synchronize the first call to GetSimpleTableDispenser; or the caller may choose to get the dispenser and set the error logger each time, ignoring any error returned.  The former is recommended. All error messages for a given product should come from the same DLL.  There is a  one to one mapping between Event Log Source and DLL.  The product ID is used as the Event Log Source, so all messages for that product ID should live within the same DLL. gdHFI

Thanks to Windows 2000 file change notification, this optional feature in IIS6 will allow users to make configuration changes via the text file while IIS is running and have them immediately applied. Scenarios Open metabase.xml file  in the morning , save after API changes This is the driving scenario for the implementation approach: the MB contains values that reflect the running state of the server. Also, programmatic changes can occur frequently at runtime (WebDAV etc.). Users typically keep files open for extended periods of time; when saving the old snapshot of the file, they would unintentionally overwrite any MB changes that occurred during this time. The implementation approach addresses this by always comparing the user s file changes against the snapshot that the user started out with, using a version/change # in the XML file to identify the proper snapshot.   Change a value in XML after delete through API Administrators may make changes via direct text entry at the same time applications are making changes via metabase APIs.  This scenario may occur when near simultaneous changes are made to the metabase that effect the same key or metabase hive.  Edit while running needs to gracefully handle this situation.  Described in section 3.4 below. Multiple people editing metabase.xml file It is possible for multiple people to edit the metabase.xml file.  However, this is a scenario we do NOT support.  The problem is that if two or more people open the SAME metabase.xml file (which implies the same major version  number) edit while running has no way to determine which user s edits should be diffed.  The result would be the user that saves the file LAST will have their changes committed and will cause the first users changes to be removed. Implementation Approach The high level implementation of Edit while running is as follows:   Edit while running works by using Windows 2000 file change notification to received alerts when the metabase file has been edited.   Once the system detects the metabase has been edited IIS will compare this file to its corresponding  History  file of the same version that is stored in the History directory IIS will diff the two files to pick up ONLY what was changed in the most recent edit IIS will then formulate the appropriate API commands to apply these changes to the in-memory metabase. The file the user just edited copied to the History directory and it s minor version is incremented to permit succeeding edits to the same version of the file to work correctly (i.e. diff only new changes). Whenever IIS saves it s in-memory metabase values (via SaveAllData described later) it creates a new historical file. Edit while running components The following files, directories, and metabase parameters are the components of Edit while running: There is a  metabase.xml  file that is freely editable by users. The metabase can be configured to keep the metabase.xml file locked (just like today), to address security concerns of some customers.  Default location is  %windir%\system32\inetsrv.  File is called metabase.xml. Each metabase.xml file contains a top-level metabase key  VersionNumber  that is a 32bit value designating the Major version number of the file. Historical copies of the metabase.xml file are stored in the %windir%\system32\inetsrv\history directory. History files are named  metabase.xml.<major version>.<minor version> The metabase contains the following keys (defined later) EnableEditWhileRunning MaxHistoryFiles Enabling / Disabling Edit While Running Edit while running is enabled by setting the metabase property: EnableEditWhileRunning to TRUE (1).  If this property is set via editing the metabase.xml file, since Edit while running is NOT on the web service will have to be stopped to facilitate picking up this change.  Alternatively, it may be activated via the UI or via the XXXXXXXXXX (Varsha?) API call. Disable Edit while running by setting EnableEditWhileRunning to FALSE (0). The default setting is FALSE (0). Control the number of History files to retain with the MaxHistoryFiles property.  This defaults to 10.  Disable history by setting this to zero (0).  This also will disable Edit While Running since there will be no history files to create differences with. Note: the EnableBackup metabase key should be eliminated   MaxHistoryFiles = 0 has the same effect.  When MaxHistoryFiles = 0, this also implies EnableEditWhileRunning= FALSE File Updates When a change notification on the metabase.xml file is received, the config system: Finds the saved, historical XML file that corresponds to the major version# in the metabase.xml. If the corresponding version is not found (or is invalid), the changes made in the metabase.xml will not picked up (eventlog entries will written warning the user of this).   Computes the differences between the latest minor version of the same major version and the current XML file. As an optimization, if the file change timestamps are identical, the config system will assume there were no updates in the file. This computation obtains a list of updates, insertions and deletions. What are the triggers for File Change notification? We apply the changes (as determined above) to the in-memory metabase image through MB APIs. When the value being changed already exists, the change will be made via an Update.  If the change is to add a key/value that does not already exist, an Insert will be used.  When the difference is the absence of a key/value, a Delete is generated. Because Edit while running functions by applying DIFFERENCES only, if a user intends to completely replace the entire metabase with a new metabase.xml file, they must stop the IISAdmin service, replace the metabase.xml, and then restart IISAdmin. Similarly, if a user intends to restore an old version of the metabase, this is accomplished in the same manner as replacing the entire metabase. If a new file contains any errors (not well-formed xml or invalid metabase schema), the entire file is copied to the History directory and append _error to the file name.  If a file of the same name already exists in the subdirectory, the new file is renamed by appending the string  _error  and an incrementing integer number to the root name of the new file (i.e. metabase_error1.xml).  An error is writing to the event log and metabase.xml is restored by calling SaveAllData.   (Varsha are we going to do this?) If the same version of metabase.xml is modified multiple times, each SaveAllData will create a new, incremented minor version of the history file.   This allows continuous edits of the same file to be done and provide the user a history of their edits to the same  major  version.  For example: Version 1 ( Metabase.xml History of version 1 ( Metabase.xml.00000000000000001.00000000 Edit Metabase.xml and save (but don t close file)  New history file ( Metabase.xml.00000000000000001.00000001 Edit Metabase.xml and save (but don t close file)  New history file ( Metabase.xml.00000000000000001.00000002 Close file, force a SaveAllData  New history file ( Metabase.xml.00000000000000002.00000000 If the metabase.xml is write locked (i.e. open for write fails), write the history file and log an error to the event log.  Varsha: Do we retry, if so, how many times? Major and minor History version numbers are generated by looking in the history directory for the largest existing major and/or minor number.   This prevents history files from being overwritten if a user restores an old history file. In the case where a user and IIS may be saving the metabase.xml file simultaneously,  it would be possible for the user s changes would be overwritten.  To avoid problem, when SaveAllData is about to rename metabase.xml, write lock metabase.xml, diff it with the latest history version. If there are any diffs it means that the file has changed, do not rename it.   When this happens, we should send ourselves a file change notification, just incase the NT file change notification fails. Interaction of File updates AND API updates If user changes a value, but a containing hive (site) has been deleted, the update must be ignored to avoid MB corruption.  An error to this effect is reported to the error log.  If a user attempts to write a script that changes to the metabase.xml file AND applies API changes a race condition between API changes and file changes exists.  This is because if a single script does both API and text changes, due to file change notification semantics the text changes are picked up after the API changes, and not in the order they were performed. We will document that a single script should not mix updated of text and API.   Writing the metabase.xml file Many changes can be made via the metabase APIs without triggering a flush of the metabase.  However, once IIS decides to write the metabase to disk, the following actions are taken via SaveAllData:  Locks the in-memory metabase (just like today). Writes a new metabase.xml file with an incremented version# to the History directory.  Unlocks the metabase. Note that this minimizes the impact on the running server and preserves current (IIS5) metabase flush semantics. Verifies that metabase.xml is not write locked. Does not contain any pending changes. If either a) or b) fail: done   assuming that a file change notification has been or will be sent; do not update metabase.xml at this time! If the file is write locked, there are cases where a change notification might not be sent (if for example the user doesn t modify the file after all). In this case, metabase.xml may remain out-of-date for an extended period of time. The config system logs an error to the event log indicating this condition. Also, on shutdown, the configuration system will verify that metabase.xml is up-to-date and attempt an another update if it is out-of-date. If metabase.xml is not write-locked and does not contain pending changes: copy the saved version of the XML file over metabase.xml. If a pending file change notification is received during a SaveAllData operation, do not overwrite (rename) metabase.xml.  To minimize the time window the check for file change notification should be done just prior to overwriting metabase.xml.  See file update spec in 3.3 regarding closing this window. SaveAllData is triggered either programmatically or automatically.  Automatic trigger is based on, if via APIs 50 changes are made or 5 minutes elapses once an API change has been made. Shutdown/Startup On shutdown: No special code:  SaveAllData  flushes any pending changes as above. If no MB in-memory changes are pending: Verify that metabase.xml is up-to-date; if not, attempt to copy latest ( latest  based on latest time-stamp) private metabase file to metabase.xml. This addresses the case were the public file was write-locked during a previous metabase cache write (SaveAllData), but the file was not changed. When Edit while running is enabled, metabase.xml is marked with a Read-Only file attribute to prevent users from inadvertently updating the file.   The read-only attributes remains until IIS is restarted or the user manually overrides the attribute. On startup: The config system read the metabase.xml on startup.    No diffing with history files is done.  If edit while running is enabled we will remove the read-only file attribute from metabase.xml. If metabase.xml is unable to be parsed and read successfully, log an error, copy the file to the error directory, and do NOT start IISAdmin. WAM application synchronization needs to be done (and Front Page change notification)   need to call Restore API to notify WAM apps. The number of history files to be kept is configurable via the MaxHistoryFiles metabase key.  When the number of history files exceeds the configured number, old (  based on time stamps) history files are cleaned up lazily.  Behavior when Edit While Running is DISABLED On Startup Read metabase.xml.  If the metabase.xml file is unable to be parsed and read successfully, log an error, copy the file to the error directory, and do NOT start IISAdmin. Take a Write Lock on metabase.xml file, fail startup if write lock can not be obtained On Shutdown No special code:  SaveAllData  flushes any pending changes as above. Remove Write Lock on metabase.xml file On file change notification Should not be able to happen due to write lock IIS Backup / Restore Edit while running is compatible with the IIS Backup / Restore APIs and UI.   Revision History April 20, 2000 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH). April 24, 2000 Rev 0.2: Incorporated spec review feedback: change log at beginning of file, error directory, detailes on handling of locked files. June 19, 2000 Rev 0.3: Addressed feedback from prior meeting based on input from VarshaJ (OmarKo). July 10, 2000 Rev 0.4: Incorporated corner case review feedback July 21, 2000 Rev 0.5: Updated  On Startup  logic August 7, 2000 Rev 0.6: Corner case review feedback September 20, 2000 Rev 0.7: feedback from Janaina and Rajesh October 28, 2000 Rev 0.8: reformatted to be more  spec like  and incorporated feedback from Janaina November 24, 2000 Rev 0.9: fix up versioning descriptions to include reference to SaveAllData Rejected Topics This section of the specification lists topics that were considered but the team has rejected.  This provides a historical record that will aid in bringing new team members up-to-date and help defend/support the teams current thinking in the spec. Topic Reason rejected 10/28/2000 Changes are logged to the event log and to a separate text log file.  These change logs allows users to verify that their changes have been accepted using only text-based tools such as telnet and event based tools like Application Center .  (Varsha   are we doing this for all changes, or just errors?) This needs to be added as a separate feature   which spec does it belong in? Optionally, customers have requested that even if no changes are made to the metabase.xml file or via the API that history files be generated on a scheduled basis.   Schedule options should include: Daily at hh:mm Weekly on ddd hh:mm Scheduled history files allows admins to say  I know the site was working last Thursday  and regardless if any changes in the metabase were made, a history file would exist. If a scheduled history can not be made, log an error to the event log. SaveAllData was originally speced to be triggered each time the system processed EWR change notification.  It will no longer do this automatically. We are making SaveAll Data more configurable. Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

FTP, script etc. Open XML file  in the morning , save after API changes This is the driving scenario for the implementation approach: the MB contains values that reflect the running state of the server. Also, programmatic changes can occur frequently at runtime (WebDAV etc.). Users typically keep files open for extended periods of time; when saving the old snapshot of the file, they would unintentionally overwrite any MB changes that occurred during this time. The implementation approach addresses this by always comparing the user s file changes against the snapshot that the user started out with, using a version/change # in the XML file to identify the proper snapshot. Change a value in XML after delete through API See below. Implementation Approach The metabase XML file contains a version number that is incremented every time the MB is saved (likely the existing MB version number). Probably can t use the existing MB change number (DWORD, rollover!). There is a  public metabase file  that is freely editable by users. The metabase can be configured to keep the public metabase file locked (just like today), to address security concerns of some customers. Should the location still be %windir%\system32\inetsrv?  Should the file be called metabase.xml?  Should the location be configurable? The config system keeps copies of previous metabase XML files around ( private metabase files ). These private backups will not be documented (as  last-known good  configurations or similar), because a) they get created at arbitrary (for the user) times and b) the system needs to modify them as users perform updates (see below).  Last-known good  is a separate feature that needs to be covered in the overall IIS configuration specification. File Updates When a change notification on the public XML file is received, the config system: Finds the saved, private XML file that corresponds to the version# in the public XML file. If the version is not found, the new file is not picked up (eventlog entries written etc.). Computes the differences between the main XML file and the previously saved XML file. As an optimization, if the file change timestamps are identical, the config system will assume there were no updates in the file.   This computation obtains a list of updates, insertions and deletions. MichTh: if a user changes a value, but a containing hive (site!) has been deleted, the update must be ignored to avoid MB corruption.  (MichTh) What is the cost of diffing for larger files? Not a blocking issue, but need to tell customers up to what MB size text editing is reasonable (or split the file)! (MichTh) There is a race condition between API changes and file changes: if a single script does both API and text changes, the text changes are picked up after the API changes, and not in the order they were performed. We can try to reduce this window by checking node change timestamps, or customers have to force a flush of the metabase and wait to the update of the public MB file? This may not be too big of an issue if we document this prominently (don t mix updated of text and API)? A user can indicate in the file that he/she intends to replace the entire metabase (by explicitly removing the version # from the file). In this case the MB is locked, flushed and the diff is computed against the latest, private version. Applies the changes to the in-memory metabase image (through MB APIs). For updates, the value must already exist. For inserts, the key/value cannot already exist.  A metabase flush is triggered after all changes have been applied and before the backup file is modified. This reduces the time until the user can obtain an up-to-date public metabase file that includes any other potentially pending MB API changes. It also ensures that no user changes get lost in case of a crash during this process. Log the changes at the beginning of the public metabase file: both successful updates (only time, not individual data!) and any errors are captured. This change log allows users to verify that their changes have been accepted using only text-based tools.  The maximum size of the log can be configured through a metabase value. What is the name/location of this global metabase value?In the W3SVC or LM hive? Should we keep this log in a separate file? Preference seemed to be to include it in the file itself to avoid file system clutter. If a new file contains any errors, the entire file is copied to an  Errors  subdirectory under the directory containing the public metabase file. If a file of the same name already exists in the subdirectory, the new file is renamed by appending the string  _conflict  and an incrementing integer number to the root name of the new file (i.e. metabase_conflict1.xml). Applies the changes to the corresponding back up file. This allows continuous edits done by the same user. It does cause problems when multiple users open (and save) the same initial file version, but multi-user scenarios are not the driving factor behind this feature: other  workflow  procedures must exist, just like for any other content file.  An alternative implementation would have been to actually write a new private file for the same version number and use file change timestamps to attempt to match user edits to the proper version; however the marginal improvement in some multi-user scenarios does not justify the additional complexity/disk space usage. If the public metabase file is locked (i.e. open for read fails), the change notification listener needs to wait for the file to be unlocked. How long do we wait? This is different from the case when the file is write-locked during SaveAllData MB API updates When a change to the in-memory metabase image occurs ( SaveAllData ), the config system Locks the metabase (just like today). Writes a new XML file with an incrementing version# to a  private  location.  Unlocks the metabase. Note that this minimizes the impact on the running server and preserves current (IIS5) metabase flush semantics. Verifies that the public metabase file is not write locked. Does not contain any pending changes. If either a) or b) fail: done   assuming that a file change notification has been or will be sent; do not update the public metabase file at this time! If the file is write locked, there are cases where a change notification might not be sent (if for example the user doesn t modify the file after all). In this case, the public metabase file may remain out-of-date for an extended period of time. The config system raises an event indicating this condition. Also, on shutdown, the configuration system will verify that the public metabase file is up-to-date and attempt an update. If the public metabase file is not write-locked and does not contain pending changes: copy the saved version of the XML file over the public metabase file. Shutdown/Startup On shutdown: No special code:  SaveAllData  flushes any pending changes as above. If no MB in-memory changes are pending: Verify that the public metabase file is up-to-date; if not, attempt to copy latest private metabase file to the public metabase file. This addresses the case were the public file was write-locked during a previous metabase cache write (SaveAllData), but the file was not changed. On startup: The config system uses the latest  private  version as the master copy on startup.  Before the web server (WAS) can start, any changes in the public metabase file must be applied.  To optimize startup time, the config system will look at the file change timestamp and only test to pending updates if the timestamp is different from the previous timestamp. Old snapshots of XML files are cleaned up lazily. The number of XML to be kept around is configurable. Revision History April 20, 2000 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH).

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Com+ Inferrence Rule for Catalog Meta Tables TitleInferrence Rule for Catalog Meta Tables Stephen Rakonza Normal.dot stephenr Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceType urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceName Ffu2WInferrence Rule for Catalog Meta Tables Classes of Inferrence Rules XML Pass:  This type of inferrence rule MUST be executed as part of the XML pass through the meta data. Second Pass:  This type of inferrence rule MAY be executed after the data has been read into tables.  This may result in the column values changing as the result of the inferrence criteria. Dependant Rule:  If an XML Pass inferrence rule requires the Second Pass inferrence, it may be necessary to classify an otherwise Second Pass rule as an XML Pass Rule.  Also, any Second Pass rule may rely on another Second Pass rule.  These cases are defined as a Dependant Rule and must be executed before that is dependant on it. Types of Inferrence Rules Not Inferred: XML Pass TableMeta.InternalName is a primary key and must exist.  It will never be inferred. ColumnMeta.DefaultValue cannot be inferred and will be set to NULL if not specified. By Position: XML Pass. TableMeta.Database is never specified explicitly.  Instead it is inferred from the parent XML element under which it resides. ColumnMeta.Index is never specified explicitly.  It is inferred by its position under its parent TableMeta XML element.  The first ColumnMeta row is inferred to the 0th ColumnMeta.Index. ServerWiringMeta row may be inferred from the ServerWiringMeta element supplied beneath the DatabaseMeta element, if none is supplied beneath the TableMeta element. By XML Name or Value: XML Pass. ColumnMeta.MetaFlags may have the fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG or fCOLUMNMETA_ENUM bit set as the result of the existance of a child element named Flag or Enum. ColumnMeta.MetaFlags may have the fCOLUMNMETA_BOOL bit set if the Type attribute has a value of BOOL. Name to Numeric Mapping:  XML Pass. RelationMeta.PrimaryColumns are specified as strings in the XML but need to be mapped to the appropriate column indexes.  This is inferred from the PrimaryTable column and ColumnMeta.InternalName. ColumnMeta.SchemaGeneratorFlags are specified as strings and need to be mapped to the appropriate flag values. Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns: Second Pass TableMeta.PublicName is assumed to be the same as the TableMeta.InternalName if not specified. ColumnMeta.FlagMask is the ORing of each of the columns tags if the ColumnMeta.MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG bit is set. Default Value: Second Pass ColumnMeta.EndingNumber has a default value of 0xffffffff.  No XML Pass rules depend on this default value being set. DatabaseMeta.BaseVersion has a default value of 0.  No XML Pass rules depend on this default value being set. Compilation Plugin: Second Pass DatabaseMeta.iSchemaBlob is generated by a piece of code that separate from the core complation process. Validation: Second Pass ColumnMeta.SchemaGeneratorFlags may have the fCOLUMNMETA_USEASPUBLICROWNAME bit set; but if the ColumnMeta.Type is not UI4 and the ColumnMeta.MetaFlags does not specify the fCOLUMNMETA_ENUM flag, this Column is in error. Inferrence Rules by Table Some of the table members below are NOT publicly accessible.  They are used during the  compilation  of the schema.  Also the  fixed  interceptor uses them to access the data more efficiently.  These  private  columns are named beginning with a lower case character. DatabaseMeta InternalName Validation DatabaseMeta.InternalName is a primarykey, so it must not be NULL. DatabaseMeta.InternalName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. DatabaseMeta.InternalName should be no more than 16 characters (including the terminating NULL). PublicName Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns DatabaseMeta.PublicName should be inferred from DatabaseMeta.InternalName if not supplied. DatabaseMeta.PublicName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. BaseVersion Default Value DatabaseMeta.BaseVersion should be defaulted to zero if not specified. ExtendedVersion Default Value DatabaseMeta.ExtendedVersion should be defaulted to zero if not specified. CountOfTables Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns DatabaseMeta.CountOfTables should be inferred from the number of TableMeta whose Database column is equal to DatabaseMeta.InternalName. iSchemaBlob Compilation Plugin cbSchemaBlob Compilation Plugin iNameHeapBlob Compilation Plugin cbNameHeapBlob Compilation Plugin iTableMeta Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns DatabaseMeta.iTableMeta is an index to the first table whose Database matches the DatabaseMeta.InternalName. DatabaseMeta.iTableMeta must have a legal value (between 0 and total number of TableMeta). iGuidDid Compilation Plugin TableMeta Database By Position TableMeta XML elements exist as children of the Database under which they belong.  So Database is inferred from the parent DatabaseMeta.InternalName. InternalName Validation TableMeta.InternalName is a primary key so it must not be NULL. TableMeta.InternalName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. PublicName Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns TableMeta.PublicName is inferred from TableMeta.InternalName if not supplied. TableMeta.PublicName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. PublicRowName Not Inferred BaseVersion Default Value TableMeta.BaseVersion is defaulted to zero if none is supplied. ExtendedVersion Default Value TableMeta.BaseVersion is defaulted to zero if none is supplied. NameColumn Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns TableMeta.NameColumn can be inferred from a column whose ColumnMeta.MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_NAMECOLUMN bit is set.  If no columns have this bit set, it is the first primary key whole type is WSTR.  If no primary keys are of type WSTR, it is the first column of type WSTR.  If no columns are of type WSTR, the NameColumn is set to be the TableMeta.NavColumn value.  Thus the NavColumn inferrence rule must be executed before the NameColumn inferrence rule. NavColumn  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns TableMeta.NavColumn can be inferred from a column whose ColumnMeta.MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_NAVCOLUMN bit is set.  If no columns have this bit set, it is set to be the first primary key that is not also a foreign key.  If no column is a primary key that is not also a foreign key, the NavColumn is set as the first primary key whose type is WSTR.  If none of the above conditions are met, the NavColumn is set as the first primary key. CountOfColumns Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns TableMeta.CountOfColumns is the count of ColumnMeta whose Table equals the TableMeta.InternalName. MetaFlags Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fTABLEMETA_INTERNAL Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_NOLISTENING Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_RELATIONINTEGRITY Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_ROWINTEGRITY Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_HASUNKNOWNSIZES Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fTABLEMETA_HASUNKNOWNSIZES indicates whether any of the table s ColumnMeta.MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_UNKNOWNSIZE bit is set.  This depends in Inferrence Rule 3.g.xxviii.1. fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICINSERT Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICUPDATE Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICDELETE Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_REQUIRESQUERY Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_HASDIRECTIVES Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns If any of the table s ColumnMeta.Metaflags specify fCOLUMNMETA_DIRECTIVE then fTABLEMETA_HASDIRECTIVES is set. fTABLEMETA_STOREDELTAS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_AUTOGENITEMCLASS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_AUTOGENCOLLECTIONCLASS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_OVERRIDEITEMCLASS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_OVERRIDECOLLECTIONCLASS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_NAMEVALUEPAIRTABLE  Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_HIDDEN Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_OVERWRITEALLROWS  Validation If any column is marked as fCOLUMNMETA_PRIMARYKEY and fCOLUMNMETA_INSERTUNIQUE, the fTABLEMETA_OVERWRITEALLROWS must be specified.  It is not inferred   it should be explicitly specified. SchemaGeneratorFlags fTABLEMETA_EMITXMLSCHEMA Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_EMITCLBBLOB Not Inferred  fTABLEMETA_ISCONTAINED Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fTABLEMETA_ISCONTAINED is set if there is a RelationMeta.ForeignTable that matches TableMeta.InternalName and RelationMeta.Metaflags  fRELATIONMETA_USECONTAINMENT bit is set. fTABLEMETA_NOTSCOPEDBYTABLENAME Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_GENERATECONFIGOBJECTS Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_NOTABLESCHEMAHEAPENTRY Not Inferred fTABLEMETA_CONTAINERCLASS Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fTABLEMETA_CONTAINERCLASS is inferred as true when the ContainerClassList column is not NULL. fCOLUMNMETA_EXTENDED By Position fCOLUMNMETA_EXTENDED is inferred as true when compiling extended schema.  It is used to distinguish between Microsoft  shipped  schema and  user-defined  schema. Not Inferred ConfigItemName Not Inferred ConfigCollectionName Not Inferred PublicRowNameColumn  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns PublicRowNameColumn is inferred from the ColumnMeta whose SchemaGeneratorFlags has the fCOLUMNMETA_USEASPUBLICROWNAME bit set. If no column has the fCOLUMNMETA_USEASPUBLICROWNAME bit set, TableMeta. PublicRowNameColumn column is defaulted to  ContainerClassList Not Inferred ciRows Compilation Plugin iColumnMeta Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns TableMeta.iColumnMeta is an index to the first ColumnMeta row whose Table matches the TableMeta.InternalName iFixedTable  Compilation Plugin cIndexMeta  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns cIndexMeta is the count of IndexMeta whose Table matches the TableMeta.InternalName. iIndexMeta  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns iIndexMeta is an index to the first IndexMeta whose Table matches the TableMeta.InternalName. iHashTableHeader  Compilation Plugin nTableID  Compilation Plugin iServerWiring  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns This is an index to the first ServerWiringMeta row whose Table matches the TableMeta.InternalName.  cServerWiring  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns This is the count of ServerWiringMeta rows whole Table matches the TableMeta.InternalName. cPrivateColumns Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns cPrivateColumns is hard coded based on the meta tables.  Only Meta tables have a private column count. ColumnMeta Table By Position The TableMeta.InternalName of the parent XML element determines Table to which the column belongs. Index  By Position The first ColumnMeta element encountered under each table is set to Index 0.  Each successive ColumnMeta element has an Index value one greater than the previous ColumnMeta.Index. InternalName  Validated ColumnMeta.InternalName is a primary key so it must not be NULL. ColumnMeta.InternalName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. PublicName  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns ColumnMeta PublicName is set to be the same as the ColumnMeta.InternalName if one is not supplied. ColumnMeta.PublicName should be validated to be a legal C++ variable name and WMI name. Name to Numeric Mapping Type is specified as a string and is mapped according to its TagMeta.  Also, ColumnMeta.Size is set for those types of fixed size. Default Value Size is defaulted to  1 if the ColumnMeta.Type is DBTYPE_STRING or DBTYPE_BYTES (or equivalent) and no Size is supplied.  Other types are statically size. MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_PRIMARYKEY Validation fCOLUMNMETA_PRIMARYKEY  must be set on at least one column per table. fCOLUMNMETA_FOREIGNKEY Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_FOREIGNKEY  is set when the table is listed as a RelationMeta.ForeignTable and the column is listed as one of the RelationMeta.ForeignColumns. fCOLUMNMETA_NAMECOLUMN Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns Only one NameColumn may be specified per table. fCOLUMNMETA_NAVCOLUMN Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns Only one NavColumn may be specified per table. fCOLUMNMETA_DIRECTIVE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_BOOL By XML Name or Value: XML Pass fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG By XML Name or Value: XML Pass fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG must only be set if the ColumnMeta.Type is DBTYPE_UI4 or DWORD_METADATA. fCOLUMNMETA_ENUM By XML Name or Value: XML Pass fCOLUMNMETA_ ENUM must only be set if the ColumnMeta.Type is DBTYPE_UI4 or DWORD_METADATA. fCOLUMNMETA_WRITENEVER Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_WRITEONCHANGE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_WRITEONINSERT Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_NOTPUBLIC Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_NOTDOCD Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_PUBLICREADONLY Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_PUBLICWRITEONLY Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_INSERTDEFAULT Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_INSERTGENERATE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_INSERTUNIQUE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_INSERTPARENT Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_NOTNULLABLE Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_NOTNULLABLE is set if fCOLUMNMETA_PRIMARYKEY is set. fCOLUMNMETA_FIXEDLENGTH Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_FIXEDLENGTH is set if Size it not  fCOLUMNMETA_HASNUMERICRANGE Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_HASNUMERICRANGE is set if the Type is UI4 and, StartingNumber is not 0 or EndingNumber is not 0xFFFFFFFF. fCOLUMNMETA_LEGALCHARSET Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_ILLEGALCHARSET Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_NOTPERSISTABLE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_MULTISTRING By XML Name or Value: XML Pass fCOLUMNMETA_EXPANDSTRING By XML Name or Value: XML Pass fCOLUMNMETA_UNKNOWNSIZE Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_UNKNOWNSIZE bit is set when ColumnMeta.Type is BYTES and ColumnMeta.Size is -1. fCOLUMNMETA_VARIABLESIZE Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns fCOLUMNMETA_VARIABLESIZE bit is set when fCOLUMNMETA_FIXEDLENGTH is not set. fCOLUMNMETA_CASEINSENSITIVE Not Inferred fCOLUMNMETA_TOLOWERCASE Not Inferred DefaultValue  Not Inferred FlagMask  Inferrence via Other Tables and/or Columns FlagMask is the ORing of all of the TagMeta when fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG is set.

They are used to describe IISSynID (ADSI concept).  The Property's type is mapped to a SynID as follows: DWORD STRING EXPANDSZ MULTISZ BINARY BOOL_BITMASK MIMEMAP IPSECLIST NTACL HTTPERRORS HTTPHEADERS So these 4 bits are inferred.  From the type, then bit shifted into place.  To map from MetaFlagsEx to SynID:  SynID=(MetaFlagsEx>>2)&0x0F;                          fCOLUMNMETA_PROPERTYISINHERITED fCOLUMNMETA_USEASPUBLICROWNAME Validation fCOLUMNMETA_USEASPUBLICROWNAME should only be set on column whose MetaFlags fCOLUMNMETA_ENUM bit is set.

If CellName is provided and CellName is not CellName equals L __FILE , it must match a ColumnMeta whose InternalName and a ColumnMeta.Table must match the QueryMeta.Table. Operator  Default Value Operator is set to  EQUAL  (zero) if not supplied. MetaFlags  Default Value (0) fQUERYMETA_ALL fQUERYMETA_ANY RelationMeta PrimaryTable  Validation PrimaryTable must not be NULL and must match a TableMeta.InternalName. PrimaryColumns  Name to Numeric Mapping There must be as many PrimaryColumns as there are primary keys in the primary table. ForeignTable  Not Inferred ForeignTable must not be NULL and must match a TableMeta.InternalName. ForeignColumns  Name to Numeric Mapping There must be as many ForeignColumns as there are primary keys in the primary table. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.Type. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.Size. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.FlagMask. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.StartingNumber. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.EndingNumber. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.CharacterSet. Each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.MetaFlags set (fCOLUMNMETA_BOOL | fCOLUMNMETA_FLAG | fCOLUMNMETA_ENUM | fCOLUMNMETA_FIXEDLENGTH | fCOLUMNMETA_HASNUMERICRANGE |fCOLUMNMETA_LEGALCHARSET | fCOLUMNMETA_ILLEGALCHARSET | fCOLUMNMETA_NOTPERSISTABLE | fCOLUMNMETA_MULTISTRING | fCOLUMNMETA_EXPANDSTRING |                                                fCOLUMNMETA_UNKNOWNSIZE | fCOLUMNMETA_VARIABLESIZE) If a containment relation, each ForeignColumn must map to a PrimaryColumn of the same ColumnMeta.MetaFags set (fCOLUMNMETA_NOTNULLABLE) MetaFlags  DefaultValue (0) fRELATIONMETA_USECONTAINMENT There can be only one containment relationship per ForeignTable. fRELATIONMETA_CONTAINASSIBLING Tables marked with this flag should infer the USECONTAINMENT flag. ServerWiringMeta By Position A table s ServerWiringMeta is inferred from a ServerWiringMeta element specified as a child of the DatabaseMeta, if no ServerWiringMeta is specified as a child to the TableMeta.

Remember, UI4 values in Meta tables may NOT be NULL. Modify TMetaInferrence::InferColumnMeta (TMetaInferrence.cpp) Modify TMetabaseMetaXmlFile.cpp so that the new column gets initialized (see everywhere a ColumnMeta struct is instantiated). Updating Catalog.DLL Once CatUtil is building correctly, and consuming the updated CATMETA_CORE.XML without errors, rebuild the entire Catalog tree (since SRC\INC has changed).

References Technical Specification for Simple Tables v2 and The Project42 Catalog, 1999, version 2 draft 60, Robert Craig Hierarchy & Merge Interceptors, November 2, 1999, Draft Rev 0.5, Markus HorstMann Audience It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the configuration system, and has read the information listed in the references section. Introduction In the current configuration system, there is always a one-to-one relation between configuration type and configuration store. Whenever you retrieve information, you only need to know the name of a single configuration store. Sometimes, it is useful to retrieve information from multiple configuration stores and combine this information. Merge Interceptors in combination with Transformers are used to provide this functionality to the configuration system. A Merge Interceptor combines the information from multiple configuration stores, and shows this information as if it came from a single configuration store to the configuration system. Transformers are used to determine which configuration stores should be used as input for the Merge Interceptors. Scenarios When a web server runs an application, it uses the configuration files that are part of the application to ensure that the application is initialized in the correct way. The configuration files for the application are the file that contains machine-wide configuration settings, the file that contains application specific configuration settings, and all configuration files in parent directories. In the .NET framework, applications run in an Application Domain. To get all configuration information for an Application Domain, we need to combine the local machine configuration file and the application configuration file. Detailed Overview The following diagram shows the interaction between the different components that make merging possible in the configuration system. The individual components are discussed in more detail in the following sections. The numbers that are used in the diagram indicate the sequence in which components get invoked. They are described in more detail below the diagram.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  , Merging Component Overview The client calls GetTable ( myTable  HYPERLINK "http://ms.com/foo"  http://ms.com/foo ) on the Dispenser. The Dispenser searches for the correct interceptor. When the table does not have a Merge Interceptor defined, the dispenser will forward the request to the correct store interceptor (i.e. XML Interceptor). Suppose now that a Merge Interceptor is defined for myTable. The Dispenser creates the Merge Interceptor, and calls Intercept on it, passing in the table name and the query string. The Merge Interceptor checks the query cells. If the Interceptor does not find a query cell of type IST_CELL_SELECTOR, it will return E_OMIT_DISPENSER, indicating that it cannot handle the request. This means that the next interceptor (i.e. store Interceptor) will be used for this query to handle the request. When it finds a query cell of type iST_CELL_SELECTOR, it means that it knows how to handle the query, and it will create the Merge Coordinator and forwards the GetTable request to the Merge Coordinator. The Merge Coordinator creates the correct transformer, and passes it the selector string. The transformer uses this string to create the correct queries (i.e. it can create a query cell for each file that needs to be merged). The Transformer is responsible for returning the queries in the correct order, so that merging will be done correctly. The last query (i.e. last configuration store) returned from the Transformer will be used to store the updates that are made against the merged results. The Merge Coordinator issues a GetTable call to the dispenser for each individual query. It does this in the order the queries are returned from the Transformer.  For each individual GetTable call, the Dispenser will call the Merge Interceptor again, but because the query type specifies a single file name now, the Merge Interceptor returns E_OMIT_DISPENSER. The Dispenser will try the store interceptor as the next  First  Interceptor, which is exactly what needs to happen. The store interceptor handles the request by opening the requested store, and returning an ISimpleTableRead2 interface pointer to it. The Merge Coordinator calls the Merger in a loop for each interface that is created in the previous step. The Merger does the actual merging of data. The Merge Coordinator returns an ISimpleTableWrite2 pointer to the Merge Interceptor, which will return the ISimpleTableWrite2 pointer to the client. Merge Interceptor The Merge Interceptor is responsible for intercepting Merge Requests for a particular table. The Merge Interceptor implements the ISimpleTableInterceptor interface, and can therefore easily be plugged into the existing configuration system. This means that only minimal changes (like adding code to get the new interceptor) have to be made to the Dispenser, and that the existing code path will not be affected in any way by the addition of the Merge Interceptor. This also means that the performance of applications that do not use the Merge Interceptor will not be affected by the addition of the Merge Interceptor. When a request comes in for a particular table, the Dispenser checks which  First  interceptors (Metaflags=  First ) are defined for that table. It will try to call Intercept for each of these interceptors, and as soon as one of the interceptors succeeds, the Dispenser will use that interceptor. Note that if one of the interceptors fails, the Dispenser will try the next  First  interceptor that is defined for that table. A table that wants to use a merge interceptor has to define at least two interceptors: the Merge Interceptor to make merging work, and a store interceptor (e.g. XML Interceptor) to retrieve the actual information from a configuration store. The reason for this is that the Merge Interceptor will eventually forward the GetTable calls to the store interceptor to retrieve the data that needs to be merged. A table that has just a Merge Interceptor defined and no store Interceptor is invalid, and GetTable calls for that table will fail. To make merging work, the order in which the interceptors are defined in the wiring is crucial: the merge interceptor must be defined before the store interceptor (e.g. XML interceptor). The Merge Interceptor checks if the request that comes in has a query cell of type iST_CELL_SELECTOR. If this is not the case, the Merge Interceptor returns E_ST_OMIT_DISPENSER, meaning that it could not handle the request.  If the request is of type iST_CELL_SELECTOR, the Merge Interceptor creates the Merge Coordinator, which will handle the request from than onwards.  The Merge Interceptor will be implemented as a Singleton, and must be thread-safe.  To define the Merge Interceptor in the wiring, a new ServerWiring element needs to be added to the collection. This is exactly the same as with any other Interceptor. <Collection InternalName= myTable <ServerWiring Interceptor= MergeInterceptor <ServerWiring Interceptor= Core_XMLInterceptor </Collection> New Query Cell type A new Query Cell type, called iST_CELL_SELECTOR will be defined that will be used for merge interceptors. This query cell type indicates that the query cell contains a selector string that can be used by the merge interceptor to determine whether we have a request for a single file or whether we need to invoke a transformer to get a collection of configuration stores. The selector string contains two parts: A Protocol, which uniquely identifies the Transformer that will be used A LogicalString, which is the logical name of the configuration and will be used by the Transformer to find the physical location of the configuration stores. The format of the selector string is  <protocol>://<LogicalString> Examples are   HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com  HYPERLINK "ftp://ms.com"  ftp://ms.com , localmachine://, appdomain://, etc. Note that the Protocol is just a string that uniquely identifies the type of Transformer that we want to use. Example: ISimpleTableWrite2 *pISTWrite; HRESULT hr; STQueryCell aMyQuery[] = {{  HYPERLINK "http://ms.com/bar/zee"  http://ms.com/bar/zee eST_OP_EQUAL,  iST_CELL_SELECTOR,  DBTYPE_WSTR,  ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof(aMyQuery)/sizeof (STQueryCell)); hr = GetTable ( myTable , (void *) aMyQuery, (void *) &cMyQueryCells,   eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, fST_LOS_READWRITE, (void **)&pISTWrite); Implementing the Merge Interceptor [ImplementationDetails] The Merge Interceptor will be implemented inside catalog.dll. The interceptor could be implemented in a separate DLL, but because of performance reasons and the fact that the Merge Interceptor is likely to be used in different settings of the configuration system, it is better to implement it directly inside the catalog. To implement the Merge Interceptor, the following changes need to be made to the existing configuration system: In catmeta_core.xml, find the SERVERWIRINGMETA Collection. This collection has a Property called Interceptor, which is an enumeration of all known interceptors. Add a new Enum at the bottom with Internalname= MergeInterceptor  and Value= In catinproc.cpp, find the function DllGetSimpleObjectByID. Add a new case inside the switch statement for the Merge Interceptor and add a new function GetMergeInterceptor that creates the Merge Interceptor. Create a new class that implements the Merge Interceptor functionality. This class implements the ISimpleTableInterceptor and ISimpleTableAdvanced interfaces. The Merge Interceptor is a library with the name mergeinterceptor.lib. This library needs to be added to the list of libraries in the sources file in the catinproc directory. The Merge Coordinator The Merge Coordinator implements the ISimpleTableWrite2 and ISimpleTableAdvanced interfaces and is responsible for the following tasks: Creating and invoking the Transformer Creating and invoking the Merger Storage and updating of the merged results To create and invoke both the Transformer and Merger, the Merge Coordinator uses the information that is defined in the schema and the information in the query string. For each Table that requires merging, the user has to specify Merger to use, while the protocol part of the selector string specifies which Transformer to use. The sections about Transformers and Mergers go into more detail about this, but it should be noted that the Merge Coordinator implements the code to figure out which Transformer and Merger to use. After the transformer and merger are created, the Merge Coordinator needs to populate the local cache that it contains. It does this by calling GetTable for each query cell that was returned by the transformer, and passing the interface pointers that where returned by GetTable to the Merger. After the merging is finished, the cache in the Merge Coordinator contains the data that will be seen by the client as the merged data. The Merge Coordinator returns an interface pointer to itself back to the client, and therefore acts like a proxy between the client and the data cache. To ensure that we can handle complex queries (i.e. Give me the merged results of six files, but only the rows for which the value of the second column equals 763), the Merge Coordinator needs to split the QueryCells that gets passed in via GetTable into two categories: The Query Cell with the Selector String All other Query Cells The Query Cell with the Selector String will be used by the Merge Coordinator to identify the Transformer that needs to be created (by using the Protocol part of the string), and it will pass the selector string to the Transformer. The Transformer returns a Single Query cell that contains the location of the configuration store.  Next, The Merge Coordinator clones the query cells that were passed in via GetTable, it ignores the SELECTOR query cell, and add the configuration store query cell to the array of query cells. This means that the query cell array does not contain a SELECTOR query cell anymore, but it contains a configuration store locator query cell. The Merge Coordinator is also responsible for updates made to the merge data. It ensures that the information is propagated to the correct configuration store, and that an update to the merged data results in either an update or insert to the configuration store, depending on whether the data came from this store or not. The main reason to have a Merge Coordinator is to make it easy for people to write new Transformers or Mergers. The person writing the new merger does not have to implement all the functions in ISimpleTableWrite2, but only has to describe the merge semantics in the Merger. This greatly simplifies Merger and Transformer development. Update Semantics The Merge Coordinator keeps track of two different read / write caches: The read / write cache for the merged data The read / write cache of the configuration store that is used for updates. This is normally the last configuration store that is returned from the Transformer. Changes are only made to the configuration store after UpdateStore is called for the Merge Coordinator. The reason to do this is to keep the read and write cache of the Merge Coordinator in synchronization. Also, it makes it easier to do the conversion (see below) in one function. The following diagram shows both caches, and the steps involved in updating both caches in cases of writes:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  , Merge Coordinator Cache Semantics The diagram shows that Inserts, Updates and Deletes (1,2,3) are only done to the Merge Coordinator cache. This means that this cache is always in sync with relation to the merged data. However, note that this not necessarily reflects the underlying updateable store, because we can have rows in the Merge Coordinator read cache that came from different configuration stores. This means that the Merge Coordinator needs to synchronize the data with the updateable store before it can write the updates to disk. The Merge Coordinator does this synchronization during UpdateStore (4). When UpdateStore is called, the following algorithm is used for each row in the Merge Coordinator Write Cache  (pMyStore is interface pointer to updateable store): Insert  Call pMyStore->AddRowForInsert, and copy the information. Update Call pMyStore->GetRowIndexByIdentity. If the row exist, do pMyStore->AddRowForUpdate, followed by copying the columns that have changes. If the row does not exist, call  pMyStore->AddRowForInsert and copy all the information. Delete  Call pMyStore->GetRowIndexByIdentity. If the row exist, call pMyStore->AddRowForDelete. If the row does not exist, do nothing. When all changes are made, call pMyStore->UpdateStore. Transformers The current configuration system uses physical file names to indicate file names of configuration stores. Although this approach works, it has the drawback that the user has to specify the exact location of a configuration store, and that it is impossible to have information coming from multiple configuration stores. To hide the physical location of a configuration store from the client, a Transformer can be used. A Transformer converts a logical name into one or more physical locations. The physical locations are expressed in the form of queries, which are used by the Merge Coordinator to do the querying against the actual configuration stores. The Merge Coordinator creates transformers by using the protocol part of the selector string. Because there is a one-one relation between protocol and Transformer, the Merge Coordinator simply searches for the correct Transformer. When a Transformer is not found, the Merge Coordinator returns with an error. The reason to retrieve the protocol from the selector string is to make it easier for clients to use Transformers. No changes are needed to the Meta information. The client just adds the protocol string for one of the known Transformers to the selector string and the Merge Coordinator will find out which Transformer to use. Transformer Types The following transformer types are possible: Application Domain Transformer Uses the name of an application domain to return the file names that are relevant for that application domain. The files include the machine configuration file, the user configuration file and the application domain configuration file. The protocol is  appdomain Web Hierarchy Transformer Uses an URL to retrieve all configuration files that are relevant to that URL. This includes all configuration files of parent URL s and the machine configuration file. The protocol is  File Transformer The File Transformer retrieves the file name that is specified in the selector string. The protocol is  Local Machine Transformer The Local Machine Transformer returns the machine-wide configuration file. The protocol is  localmachine During the design of the transformer interface, we should not exclude other selectors that might be needed in the future. An example of such a tranformer is the SQLTransformer. Specifying Transformer Type in schema The following schema describes the TRANSFORMER_META Collection. <Collection  InternalName= TRANSFORMER_META PublicRowName= TransformerWiring MetaFlags= INTERNAL NOLISTENING>   <Property InternalName= Protocol  Type=  MetaFlags= PRIMARYKEY CASEINSENSITIVE   <Property InternalName=  Type= <Enum InternalName= AppDomain Value= <Enum InternalName= WebHierarchy Value= <Enum InternalName= Value= <Enum InternalName= LocalMachine Value=   </Property>   <Property InternalName= DLLName  Type= </Collection> IConfigTransformer Interface HRESULT Initialize ( [in] LPCWSTR I_wszProtocol,  [in] LPCWSTR i_wszSelectorString,  [out] ULONG * o_pcRealConfigStores [out] ULONG * o_pcPossibleStores); HRESULT GetRealConfigStores ( [in] ULONG i_cRealConfigStores,  [in,out] ConfigStore * o_aRealConfigStores); HRESULT GetPossibleConfigStores ([in] ULONG i_cPossibleConfigStores,     [in,out] ConfigStore * o_aPossibleConfigStores); struct ConfigStore { LPCWSTR wszLogicalPath;  // logical path name STQueryCell  query;   // query cell identifying a single configuration store.  The IConfigTransformer interface consists of three functions: Initialize, GetRealConfigStores and GetPossibleConfigStores. The Initialize function initializes the transformer by passing in the selector string, and returns the number of configuration stores. When considering configuration stores, the transformer distinguishes between real configuration stores and possible configuration stores. A real configuration store is a store that is part of the merging, while a possible configuration store is a configuration store that doesn t exist. An example is a file that is part of a web hierarchy, but doesn t exist. This file is a possible configuration store, but not a real configuration store. The reason to break this up, is that the merge coordinator is only interested in real configuration stores, while other parts of the system might be interested in all possible configuration stores. To get the configuration store information, the GetXXXConfigStores function will be called. The reason to have two separate functions is to simplify the memory allocation that needs to be done by the client. The client is responsible for allocating the correct amount of memory for all parameters. HRESULT Initialize ( [in] LPCWSTR i_wszProtocol,        [in] LPCWSTR i_wszSelectorString,  [out] ULONG * o_pcRealConfigStores [out] ULONG * o_pcPossibleConfigStores);      I_wszProtocol Protocol that was used to create this Transformer i_wszSelectorString String that specifies which configuration store information needs to be retrieved in the transformer. This string is different for each transformer. For a webHierarchy transformer, this is http://ms.com/foo/bar/zee. The Selector String does not contain the protocol part. o_pcRealConfigStores Number of real configuration stores that are found by the transformer. o_pcPossibleConfigStores Number of possible configuration stores that are found by the transformer. HRESULT GetXXXConfigStores( [in] i_cConfigStores,  [in, out] ConfigStore * o_paConfigStores); i_cConfigStores Number of configuration stores that can be stored in o_paConfigStores o_paConfigStores An array of configuration stores that gets filled up with configuration information. The client allocates the memory. Example: For XML files: queryInfo->pData  c:\mydir\config.cfg queryInfo->eOperator  = eST_OP_EQUAL; queryInfo->iCell = iST_CELL_FILE; queryInfo->dbType = DBTYPE_WSTR; queryInfo->cbSize The reason to use query cells is that it is more extensible. When in the future the configuration supports new query cells, we can easily create a new transformer that generates these query cells, without making any changes to the public interfaces. When we would expose filenames directly, we can only support transformers that generate filenames, which might not necessarily be the case in the future. Example: Suppose we have the following virtual directories set up for a website:  HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com -> c:\inetpub\wwwroot  HYPERLINK "http://ms.com/foo/bar"  http://ms.com/foo/bar -> d:\bar When we call  ITransformer * pTransformer; // Get valid transformer (CoCreateInstance or equivalent) ULONG cRealConfigStores; ULONG cPossibleConfigStores; hr = pTransformer->Init (  HYPERLINK "http://ms.com/foo/bar/zee"  http://ms.com/foo/bar/zee &cRealConfigStores,  &cPossibleConfigStores); ConfigStore *pConfigStores = new ConfigStore[cRealConfigStores]; hr = pTransformer->GetConfigStores (cRealConfigStores, pConfigStores); The result is: pRealConfigStores [0].wszLogicalPath   HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com pRealConfigStores [0].query.pData  c:\inetpub\wwwroot pRealConfigStores [1].wszLogicalPath   HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com pRealConfigStores [1].query.pData  c:\inetpub\wwwroot\foo pRealConfigStores [2].wszLogicalPath   HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com /foo/bar pRealConfigStores [2].query.pData  d:\bar pRealConfigStores [3].wszLogicalPath   HYPERLINK "http://ms.com"  http://ms.com /boo/bar/zee pRealConfigStores [3].query.pData  d:\bar\zee cRealConfigStores = 4; Defining Custom Transformers [ImplementationDetails] To define your own custom Transformer in a separate DLL (say transfomer.dll), you have to do the following: Add meta information about the new transformer to catmeta_core.xml Create and implement a class that implements ITransformer in transformer.dll. Export DllGetSimpleObjectByID from transformer.dll. Implement  STDAPI DllGetSimpleObjectByID (ULONG i_ObjectID, REFIID riid, LPVOID *o_ppv) This function returns a pointer to the ITransformer interface that was implemented in step 2. In general, this function creates the new Transformer, and calls QueryInterface on it. i_ObjectID has the internal ID of the Transformer which is defined in catmeta.h and is derived from the schema information defined in catmeta_core.xml. Mergers The merger is responsible for defining the merge semantics between two configuration stores. It describes how the merging of two configuration stores is done. A Merger is created and invoked by the Merge Coordinator by using information defined in the configuration schema. A Merger only supports two-way merges, i.e. it can only handle two configuration files per merge. Note that this does not exclude multiple files from being merged together. It only means that in each merge there are only two files that are merged together. The Merge Coordinator calls the Merger in a loop for all configuration files to merge multiple files. Mergers are defined at either database level or table level, and there can be only a single merger per database table active at any time. When a Merger is defined at database level, the tables in the database will inherit this Merger when there is no Merger defined at table level. Because a Merger is defined at database level, it can assume that the layout of the configuration stores that need to be merged is the same, i.e. the same number of columns and the same data types. This is enforced by the Meta schema, because there is only one way to define the columns and data types for a single table. Whenever a Merger is defined, catutil.exe will automatically insert the Merge Interceptor as the first interceptor for that table. The reason to do this is to enforce the order in which interceptors are defined (i.e. the Merge Interceptor needs to be defined before the other interceptors), and to make it easy for the user to define Mergers. Merger Interface The Merger Interface consists of a single function, called Merge that implements the merge semantics for two configuration stores. The interface is kept simple to enable future mergers to be implemented quickly. interface ISimpleTableMerge : IUnknown HRESULT Initialize ( [in] i_cNrColumns,  [in] i_cNrPKColumns,  [in, size_is(i_cNrPKColumns)] i_aPKColumns); HRESULT Merge ([in] ISimpleTableRead2  * i_pSTRead,  [in,out]  ISimpleTableWrite2  * io_pCache); Parameters: i_pSTRead This is an ISimpleTableRead2 interface pointer to a configuration store. This data from this configuration store will be merged with the data that is kept in the cache that is represented by the io_pCache pointer. io_pCache This SimpleTable acts like the parent during the merge, and contains the results of merging. The merge function merges the information from pSTRead with the information in io_pCache. io_pCache acts like the parent during the merge. The reason to implement the merge interceptor this way is to minimize the amount of copying that has to take place. The cache is a memory table that is retrieved from the Dispenser, and is used by the Merge Coordinator to store the merged data. For each query cell that is returned from a transformer, the Merge Coordinator calls GetTable with information about that query cell, and passes the results to the Merge Interceptor. The order in which the files are returned by the transformer determines the order in which the files are merged. The last file will be used to make updates to the configuration store. Merger Types The following merger types will be implemented: Property Override Merger (POM) This merger implements  last writer wins  inheritance semantics (similar to the IIS5 meta-base inheritance semantics). A non-null property in the child configuration collection simply replaces a property in the parent collection. Items in the parent collection are matched by primary key of the child collection. List Append Merger (LAM) This merger appends the items in the child collection to the end of the parent collection. In case of singletons, the child wins. List Prepend Merger (LPM) This merger appends the items in the parent collection to the end of the child collection. In case of singletons, the parent wins. List Merge Merger [See Merge spec] Merger Definition The merger will be defined as part of the ServerWiring information of the Merge Interceptor. <ServerWiring Interceptor= MergeInterceptor  Merger= <name>  MergerDLLName= <DllName> Merger This is a unique name that identifies the Merger in the configuration system. The configuration system uses this to instantiate the correct Merger. MergerDLLName To make it easier to write Mergers, Mergers can be implemented in a separate DLL.   <Collection InternalName= SERVERWIRING_META  PublicName= ServerWiring     MetaFlags= INTERNAL NOLISTENING>  existing stuff>   <Property InternalName= Merger  Type= <Enum InternalName= PropertyOverride  Value= <Enum InternalName= ListAppend Value= <Enum InternalName= ListPrepend Value= <Enum InternalName= ListMerge Value=   </Property>   <Property InternalName= MergerDLLName  Type= </Collection> Example <Collection InternalName= myTable <ServerWiring Interceptor= MergeInterceptor <ServerWiring Interceptor= Core_XMLInterceptor <Merger Type= ListAppend  DLL= ListAppend.DLL </ServerWiring> Defining Custom Mergers To define your own custom Merger in a separate DLL (say merger.dll), you have to do the following: Add meta information about the new merger to catmeta_core.xml Create and implement a class that implements IMerger in merger.dll. Export DllGetSimpleObjectByID from merger.dll. Implement  STDAPI DllGetSimpleObjectByID (ULONG i_ObjectID, REFIID riid, LPVOID *o_ppv) This function returns a pointer to the IMerger interface that was implemented in step 2. In general, this function creates the new Merger, and calls QueryInterface on it. i_ObjectID has the internal ID of the merger which is defined in catmeta.h and is derived from the schema information defined in catmeta_core.xml. Add the merger to the Merge Interceptor for which you want to use the new merger. CATUTIL changes To make it easy for users to define new mergers, and to minimize the amount of schema changes they have to make, a number of modifications to CATUTIL are needed. Automatic Merge Interceptor Creation When a user defines a Merger for a particular table or database, CATUTIL needs to add a new merge interceptor to the list of interceptors that are defined for this table. Merger Inheritance Semantics Tables that do not have Merge information defined for them, inherit the Merge information that is defined at database level. Multiple Merge Definition Error Message When a table of database has more as one Merger defined, CATUTIL will generate an error message indicating that only a single Merger can be defined for each table. Populate MERGER_META and TRANSFORMER_META tables CATUTIL needs to populate both tables by using the information defined in the schema. ServerWiring inheritance Currently, CATUTIL only uses the first ServerWiring element defined at database level, and ignores all other ServerWiring elements. CATUTIL needs to be updated to remember all ServerWiring elements, so that when a table does not have ServerWiring elements defined, it will inherit all ServerWiring elements that are defined at database level. Performance Requirements Merging of data can be expensive, especially when complicated merges are done. During the implementation the following Performance Requirements need to be met: [List Performance Requirements here] Open Issues In addition to the issues outlined throughout the document, the following items require further attention: I do not like the order dependency of Interceptors. When I define a Merge Interceptor after the XML core interceptor, the whole thing does not work. Is there a way to say that the configuration system should always try a merge interceptor before any other interceptor? We could have a new metaflag that identifies the merge interceptor. Catutil could use this flag to move the merge interceptor in front of any other interceptors.  ANSWER: This might be done in version 2. How much validation needs to be done during merging? Do we need to validate that the number of columns in the different data stores is the same and that the datatypes of these columns are consistent? If so, do we need to do this all the time, or can we do it one time. This issue is especially important when dealing with different tables names in different databases, i.e. what happens when I merge myTable in myDatabase with yourTable in yourDatabase? Note that the last case is possible when using a transformer. ANSWER: We do not support different table names. When use the List Append Merge Interceptor what happens with Singleton collections. Suppose a singleton is defined in both the parent and the child. Which of the singletons is used?  ANSWER: child wins. The Shell hooks up plugins. Is this going to work with our design, i.e. does the plug-in get called twice, once for XML Interceptor and once for Merge Interceptor.  ANSWER: Merge Interceptor gets implemented as full interceptor, not as interceptor plugin. We need to find a solution for adding new Mergers or Transformers without changing catmeta_core.xml. Changing catmeta_core.xml is a hack, and does not give us the extensibility we need, because people still need to run catutil.exe to get the program up and running. Note that there is a bug related to this (45789). At the moment, we are passing in the ID that is assigned in catmeta_core.xml to DllGetSimpleObjectByID. We should have an extensibility mechanism, so that I can define my own ID s in an extended catmeta_core.xml file, and this gets read as well. Which LOS flags do we support? ANSWER: NONE, CONFIGWORK, READWRITE, UNPOPULATED, REPOPULATE Need to describe new virtual column  FileName/Configuration store . How do we represent this, i.e. name is not necessarily unique. This is especially an issue with the Property Override Merger. Should we return a Multistring with all the file names? Comma separated string? What if a configuration store does not have a name? ANSWER: Do we need to implement events? ANSWER: No. Do we have to make changes to existing interceptors when I introduce new Meta Tables? For instance, the MetaMerge Interceptor handles merging of Meta data. Does this interceptor need to be updated as well? What should happen when we do DELETE on a row that does not exist in the updateble store. An example is the list-append merging of two files, where a row in the first file does not exist in the second file. When we delete the row, what should be done to this row? Shouldn t we allow deletes on rows that do not exist? ANSWER: Logic Update/Insert problem: When doing an update to the merged data, we could end up with an Insert in the updateable store. What happens when the logic verification for the insert fails? Should we tell the user that the insert fails, eventhough he was doing an update?

Purpose This document describes the high level design of the .NET Framework WMI Provider. References Technical Specification for Simple Tables v2 and The Project42 Catalog, 1999, version 2 draft 60, Robert Craig Hierarchy & Merge Interceptors, November 2, 1999, Draft Rev 0.5, Markus HorstMann WMI documentatation from the Platform SDK Audience It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the configuration system, WMI, and is familiar with writing a WMI Provider. Detailed Description The provider contains three different layers: A layer that hides the ISimpleTable interface and converts catalog datatypes to variants A layer that hides the WMI Interface and forwards all request to helper functions A layer that talks to layer 1 and layer 2, and does all the hard work ISimpleTable abstraction layer The WMI Provider interface uses variants to set values of properties, methods and parameters. The catalog uses C++ types. To avoid conversion from C++ types in different places of the code, a separate class is needed that does conversion from variant to Config types and from Config types to variants. Also, we want to hide the complex ISimpleTable interface from the WMI Provider To provide the above functionality a number of classes was created: CConfigTableMeta This class gets the table and column meta from the catalog for a particular table and stores it in an easy to use format. This class is always used in combination with CConfigRecord and CConfigQuery. CConfigRecord This class converts variants to Config types and Config types to variants. It uses a CConfigTableMeta object to get the meta information, and does the conversion in a single place. The class contains two arrays: One to hold pointers to catalog information One to hold the variants Only a specific points in time, the class will sync the variant and catalog arrays. CConfigQuery This class abstracts the ISimpleTableRead and ISimpleTableWrite interfaces. From the WMI point of view, it only uses CConfigQueries and CConfigRecords, and never deals directly with the catalog. The reason for this is to make changes to catalog or query without having to make a lot of changes to the WMI code WMI Interface layer The WMI Interface layer contains the following classes: CWQLQueryParser Parses a WQL query. CObjectPathParser Parses an WMI Object Path. Helper class Layer This layer maps specific queries and request to specific helper classes. There are a number of different helper classes for the following types: GetObjectAsync request for configuration class The instancehelper class takes care of this (see next section for more details) GetObjectAsync request for association class The CAssocCatalog class takes care of this GetObjectAsync request for non-configuration class  A special purpose function is written for these. Examples are webapplication and codegroup, which have special code that is not stored in the configuration schema. ExecQueryAsync request for configuration class ExecQueryAsync request for association class ExecQueryAsync request for non-configuration class For instance, all GetObjectAsync calls get mapped to the CInstanceHelper class, while all queries get mapped to the CQueryClass. Configuration classes Every class that is defined in a configuration schema is exposed via WMI. To ensure that a WMI class is properly related to a class in the catalog, two extra qualifiers are added to each class: Database This maps to the database name in the catalog InternalName This maps to the internal name in the catalog When a ExecQuery or GetObjectAsync, the WMI Provider find out which class is involved. For this class, it gets the above qualifier, and uses the qualifiers to query the catalog (using the CConfigQuery class). Associations The WMI provider supports different association types. An association type is assigned to all associations for which the code to create the association is the same. For instance, to create an association between two configuration classes, we need to do a certain type of work, but for all configuration classes, this work is exactly the same. However, for an association between a webapplication and configuration class diff The way the WMI provider between different association types is by using the AssocType qualifier, which is specified on each association. The following associations are supported: catalog Association between two classes defined in the catalog location Association between a location element and a class in the catalog appunmerged Association between a webapplication and a class in the catalog (unmerged view) appmerged Association between a webapplication and a class in the catalog (merged view) filehierarchy Association between webapplication and configuration files that are used during merging webappchild Assocation between webapplication and child webapplications of this webapplication webappparent Assocation between webapplication and parent webapplication of this webapplication Each association type is implement in its own class CAssoc<type>, and all these classes inherit from the CAssocBase base class, which implements things that are common between all association classes. Special Considerations Exceptions/Variants The code internally uses variant_t and bstr_t for variants and bstrs. These classes can throw exceptions in case of memory failure, and therefore, the main entry points in the provider have try .. catch .. blocks. Smart Pointers The code uses smart pointers for COM Interfaces (CComPtr) and dynamic memory allocation (TSmartPointer). The reason for this is to avoid reference counting problems and memory leaks. Error Handling The error handling scheme used is to return from a function as soon as something is wrong. This means that a function can have multiple exit points. This is not a problem, as long as smart pointers are used to avoid memory leaks. Example: HRESULT hr = DoSomething (); If (FAILED (hr)) TRACE (L DoSomething has failed return hr; hr = DoSomethingElse (); If (FAILED (hr)) TRACE (L DoSomethingElse has failed return hr; return hr; Tracing When something goes wrong in the provider, TRACE code is used to identify the where the error occurred. This TRACE code needs to be added to each place where something can go wrong. The benefit of doing this is that you get a full call trace from the place where something went wrong. This is very helpful during development and debugging. Open Issues None. Revision History April 13, 2001 Rev 0.1  (Marcelv): Created. Microsoft Confidential Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. TextFileLogger Specification TitleTextFileLogger Specification Mohit Srivastava Normal.dot Mohit Srivastava Microsoft Word 9.0TextFileLogger Specification Author: MohitS Date:   TIME \@ "MMMM d, yyyy"  April 24, 2001 Why is it Needed? In certain scenarios, it is desirable to log errors to a textfile log.  Specifically, in IIS, the textfile log is used so remote administrators can easily view WAS and Edit-While-Running errors.  However, there needs to be mechanism to bound the total log size.   Exposure The TextFileLogger is an internal non-exposed class that is instantiated and used by certain ICatalogErrorLoggers.  The log file is split into dwNumFiles of size dwLogSize/dwNumFiles each identified by a 32-bit unsigned version number.  The naming format is as follows: %windir%\<product> config_xxxxxxxxxx.log Once textlog n-1 is full, a textlog n is created, and textlog n-dwNumFiles is deleted.  If textlog n-dwNumFiles is undeletable, this is non-fatal. dwNumFiles is internally configurable but not configurable by the user.  dwLogSize is configurable through the following registry key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Catalog42\<product>\TextFileLogSize (dword). If the key is missing or unreadable, a default size of 500K is assumed.  Also, the default is assumed if TextFileLogSize < 500K. Algorithm The first time the dll is loaded, the highest version log file is determined.  g_dwVersion, stored in a shared segment (so it is accessible from multiple processes), is set as follows: If the highest log file version is <= MAX_ULONG and file is not-full, we use this file. If the highest log file version is < MAX_ULONG and file is full, we use  highest log file version + 1 .  If file exists, it gets blown away.  If it can t be blown away, this is fatal, and the logging operation fails. If the highest log file version is MAX_ULONG and file is full, we start at 0 and look for the first non-full log file. Subsequently, when the logfile corresponding to g_dwVersion gets full, we just increment g_dwVersion.  If this new log version already exists, it is blown away.  If it can t be blown away, this is fatal, and the logging operation fails. Whenever g_dwVersion is set, the log file version g_dwVersion-dwNumFiles is deleted. Internal Design Issues Except g_dwVersion, the TextFileLogger is stateless.  As a result, a file handle is opened and closed for every Log operation. Any operation involving the log file(s) and/or g_dwVersion is protected by a mutex.

Scenarios Staging A development team is using VS7 s web project feature to author a web site. Their app consists of XSP pages, message queue objects, eventlog/perfmon registrations, private assemblies and two COM+ 1.0 components in a COM+ 1.0 application. The app also uses the shared XDO assembly. The development team has a dedicated development server on which the web project and the application reside. The development server, although a single node, runs ACS  Gemini , Developer Edition, to enable the team to develop and unit test their eventlog/perfmon functionality with ACS  Gemini s monitoring and logging features. The development team has reached a milestone and is ready to hand the application over to the test team. The test team wants to copy the application onto their staging server, which is an ACS  Gemini  server array. The test manager uses ACS  Gemini s replication feature on the developer server to copy the web project to the master server of the test server array. The source files are automatically filtered out; only the required pages, assemblies and the shared XDO assembly are copied over to the test server. ACS  Gemini  creates a new message queue on the test server, registers eventlog/perfmon entries and installs the COM+ 1.0 application. The test manager uses the ACS  Gemini  admin UI to configure the database location for the app , so that all the XSP pages and assemblies that access the database via XDO use the test SQL Server database instead of the developer SQL Server database. The test team accesses the home page of the application, and gets an error page indicating that a file was not found. A developer quickly detects a hard-coded reference to the f: drive on the dev server, and fixes the bug. The test manager copies the changes to the test server using the ACS  Gemini  replication feature; only the changed files are updated; the test manager does not have to reconfigure the database location. Application Export The test team determines that the application has met the quality and performance bars. The release manager uses the Application Export tool (in ACS  Gemini ? VS7?) to generate a CAB file. All environment specific configuration information is automatically stripped out. The release manager posts the CAB file to the company s release web server. Application upload/install Customer   receives notification that the first release of the application is available on the company s release web server. The customer wants to install the application on a test server, which is an ACS  Gemini  server array. The customer opens the ACS  Gemini  admin UI, selects the test server array and chooses the  Install Application  feature. The ACS  Gemini  admin UI asks the customer to type in the URL of the source application. The admin UI then shows the branded setup page of the application and suggests a default VSite/Directory to install the application into. The customer chooses the suggested default and the application is downloaded from the company s release web server and uploaded to the customer s test server array. The ACS  Gemini  UI then asks the customer to configure the application by indicating the location of a SQL Server database, and providing security information. The uploaded application is ready to use: shared assemblies are in the assembly cache, COM+ 1.0 applications are registered, message queues are created, eventlog/perfmon entries are created. Soon after, the company releases a service pack to the application. The customer selects the application in the ACS  Gemini  admin UI, and chooses the  Update Application  feature. The ACS  Gemini  UI confirms that the previous source URL is still valid, and downloads/uploads the new application to the test server. The customer does not need to reconfigure the application. Replication The customer has installed the application onto the master server of the test server array. ACS  Gemini  automatically replicates the application to the member servers. The customer does not have to specify any additional information. All elements in the application are properly propagated and registered. Application download/install (Personal tier) An end-user is using an e-commerce web site using IE 5.5. The web site offers an option of supporting off-line shopping. The customer clicks on the off-line link and the web application is automatically downloaded to the machine. A configuration page (branded to the e-commerce web site), shows and lets the end-user select certain preferences (pin for offline, automatic upload of orders on connect etc.). The customer disconnects from the Internet and continues using parts of the e-commerce web site functionality. The end-user runs out of disk-space and flushes the browser cache. The off-line application continues to be available because the customer selected to pin it for off-line use. The end-user goes to the  Off-line application add/remove  page and sees a list of all off-line applications. The end-user can manually configure or uninstall each of the applications. Requirements Web application upload Remote install/upload from browser client Brandable setup pages FTP/WebDav upload of entire web application tree Auto-Registration Secure registration of DSNs, MSMQ, perfmon, eventlog etc. Secure registration of COM components (without Fusion 2.5) Secure, zero-impact install of COM components (with Fusion 2.5 support) (P2) Configuration/Customization Integrated with WebServer admin UI Brandable config pages Discoverability of Managed Properties Replication /  Export Filter unwanted files from a web site Assembly dependencies for non-code/late-bound consumers Deployment instructions for shared assemblies Deployment instructions for COM components Download of Personal Tier Web Apps to an IE 5.5 client Manifest details Need to reconcile this with Fusion 2.5 manifest work, and Darwin XML work. Manifest information is stored in the application configuration file in the application root directory. The application configuration file is named  Config.cfg We may want to partition configuration files based on developer vs. administrator or machine-specific vs. structural. The application configuration file is an XML file that can be read and written through the   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/urt configuration system.doc"  URT Configuration System . The application configuration file should have the following XML header definition (automatically generated if the file is created through the URT Configuration System: <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms"> </configuration> Application identity The application identity is used for UI purposes (ACS  Gemini  UI, Add/Remove programs). <ApplicationManifest    Identity= <assemblyname>    Name= 401K Server Application Should we simply add this to the URT <Application> tag? <ApplicationManifest     Identity= <assemblyname>    Name= 401K Off-line Application  PinForOffline= Default VSite information How do we express this? Should be useable in both server and personal tier scenarios. <ApplicationManifest     Identity= <assemblyname>    Name= 401K Application    DefaultVirtualDirectory= MyCompanyApps/401K The DefaultVirtualDirectory attribute is a relative URL, indicating the default directory name to be used when installing an application onto a machine for the first time. The ACS  Gemini  installation tool will use a sub directory under the default site, that corresponds to the URL that is obtained by composing the default site binding with the DefaultVirtualDirectory relative URL. Example: Default site: http://www.microsoft.com, home directory: c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Application directory: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyCompanyApps\401k,  Application URL: http://www.microsoft.com/MyCompanyApps/401k. List of files to be included/excluded This section indicates the physical files under the application root directory (= the directory containing the manifest file) that should be included or excluded. If no <FileExportFilter> tag is specified all files in the application root directory and all its sub directories are considered to be part of the application. <FileExportFilter>   <File Path= <regex>  Exclude= [True | False]  /> <!-- defaults to  False </FileExportFilter> Should we really allow regular expressions? List of Assembly Dependencies of the app Existing XML encoding? List of COM Components to be installed/replicated <ComComponents>   <ComPlus1Application AppID= <guid>   <Component File= <path>  /> <!-- relative or absolute --> </ComComponents> What is the Fusion XML syntax for COM components? List of Shared Assemblies to be installed/replicated Existing XML encoding? <SharedAssemblies>   <Assembly Name= <assemblyname>  AllowPrivateInstall= </SharedAssemblies> Custom registration <CustomRegistration>   <RegistrarClass attr1=  attr2=   <AssemblyInstaller Path= <path> </CustomRegistration> Custom Configuration UI <CustomConfigPages>   <ConfigPage Url= [relative url]               ConfigTypes= [All | <configtype> <configtype>]               AddToAdminApp= [True | False] </CustomConfigPages> <CustomConfigTemplates>   <ConfigTemplate Url= [relative url]                   ConfigTypes= [All | <configtype> <configtype>]                   AddToAdminApp= [True | False] </CustomConfigTemplates> <CustomConfigApps>   <ConfigApp Url= [relative url]  AddToAdminApp= [True | False] </CustomConfigApps> DSN, MSMQ configuration How can we discover this information and provide UI for it? Should we host managed properties on the config system? Filtering out machine specific config <RemoveOnExport>   <Config ConfigType= <configtype > Selector= <selector>   <Config  </RemoveOnExport> Should we make this part of the definition of a collection/property? Preserving/reconciling configs during staging The source machine of a staging replication can carry multiple application manifests for the same application. One of the manifests ( config.cfg  in the current proposal), carries the information used when running the application on the source itself. Other manifests carry the configuration information for each of the target servers. It is up to the developer/administrator to propagate any structural changes from the real manifest to the manifests for the target servers. Should we make this easier by separating config from definition into two files? Implementation considerations Auto-registration The URT configuration system is already listening for change notifications for web applications. When it refreshes its cache from newly installed configuration files, it also detects the custom registration section in the configuration file and performs the indicated steps. The custom steps are performed in the same application domain that the application would run in, so that all custom steps are subject to the same restrictions as the actual application. Web download for personal tier How can we use IE code-download/CDF/OSD for this? Having a list of files in a CAB is a good first step. How can we put the application files into the browser HTTP cache? Assembly loading already is redirectable into the HTTP cache. Config and XSP would have to do similar work. Open Issues In addition to the issues outlined throughout the document, the following items require further attention: Revision History November 19, 1999 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH): Created.  ACS  Gemini  is the set of features in a future ACS release that targets the URT1/VS7 platform.  This could happen either on the source (= developer) server or on the target (= test) server.

Requirements Discoverability It must be possible (for a generic configuration consumer) to discover the set of available collections and their properties.  It should be possible to discover the set of available instances in a collection Early bound access: it must be possible for consumers to obtain high-performance access to configuration information when they have a-priori knowledge about the schema of a collection. Extensibility Schema It must be possible for internal Microsoft groups to extend the schema by adding new collections, relate them to existing collections and modify existing collections (typically adding new properties). It must be possible for customers to extend the schema by adding new collections, relate them to existing collections (Microsoft defined or defined by other customers).  It should be possible for customers to add new properties to existing collections.  It should be possible to add schema for only part of the configuration hierarchy (granularity: application/appdomain level), without impacting applications in other parts of the configuration hierarchy and without requiring machine administrative privileges.  Defining and extending the schema must be easy for both internal groups and customers. Specifically, no special deployment step (registration, setup etc.) must be required for customer extensions. It should be easy to define schema for hierarchal configuration information, i.e. it should not be required to explicitly declare relations between collections, when this can be derived from context. Wiring information It must be possible for internal Microsoft groups to add new interceptors to the wiring information for an existing collection, as well as define configuration objects and interceptors for new collections. It should be possible for customers to use existing interceptors for their own collections.  Compatibility It must be possible to mechanically map the configuration system schema and data to CIM/WMI, ADSI, XML-Schema/Data, ADO+ data sets. The mapping should be loss-less, even though extended meta-data may require more than one "collection" or non-intuitive encoding in the target schema. It must be possible to mechanically map CIM/WMI, ADSI, XML-Schema/Data and ADO+ data sets to configuration system schema and data. The mapping should be loss-less, even though some of the information may require non-intuitive encoding in the configuration system. Configuration files must carry a XML schema definition that allows any XML reader to perform XML schema validation etc. Specifically VS7 XML editors must be able to apply auto completion etc. How do we locate XML schema files? We need a urn: -like mechanism => CLovett/AmarG Schema Definition The configuration system assumes a well-defined schema for the configuration types that it manipulates. In some cases the schema can be implied from the data file, but nonetheless, the configuration system internally is schema driven. This schema must provide: ConfigType name Property Name and Type for each property in the ConfigType Additionally (and optionally) the schema can provide: Primary Key Property validation rules Property Default values Index definitions Query hints Containment of and Relations between ConfigTypes Example: <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <Property Name= SiteID Type= PrimaryKey   <Property Name= DefaultAppPoolID Type=   <Property Name= HomeDirectory Type=   <Property Name= Bindings Type= BYTES </Collection> Collection Definition ConfigType The ConfigType indicates the string to be used for programmatic reference to the collection from managed code (i.e. for requests to the Configuration Manager, in generated config collection classes, etc.). The ConfigType must be globally unique, and should therefore be defined using reverse DNS syntax, i.e.  com.mycompany.myconfigtype System.IIS.Sites". RaduP: In current drops, the ConfigType is just a string and the config objects are in namespace  System.Config.Objects The ConfigType is also the class name of the object returned by the configuration manager for requests for this ConfigType. The  namespace  of the ConfigType is the string preceding the last   in the ConfigType, i.e.  com.mycompany System.IIS .Should we really require the ConfigType to be the same as the config collection class? [Yes] Can we somehow deal with namespace collisions? Scope name resolution s to appdomains? Allow aliases to be defined? Should we use namespaces to establish default wiring? [tentative answer: No] How can we make XML syntax user friendly? xmlns could avoid the  System.IIS.  prefix Internal Name (optional) RaduP: In current drops, the Internal Name is not optional. The internal name is used for generating C++ header files. If no internal name is specified, the configuration system defaults it to the ConfigType, replacing any invalid characters (especially  ) with   (underscore) characters. Example: <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites  InternalName= SYSTEM_IIS_SITES Do we need a separate display name for generic UI? [Yes] Do we need a separate XML element name? [No] Item Name (optional) Indicates the name to be used when referring to items in this collection. If no ItemName is specified the configuration system defaults it to <ConfigType>Item. The ItemName is scoped within the name space of the ConfigType: If a globally unique item name is required (for config in XML without specifying the containing collection, for config item classes etc.), the item name and the ConfigType are composed as follows: If the ConfigType string does not contain a  : <ConfigType><ItemName> (String concatenation). If the ConfigType contains a  : replace the string following the last   with the ItemName. Examples: <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites  ItemName= <!-- Globally unique item name: System.IIS.Site --> <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites <!-- ItemName: System.IIS.SitesItem, same as globally unique item name --> Should we require/allow the ItemName to be specified as fully qualified name? Item Class (optional) The configuration system returns instances of a well-known configuration collection class, which contain instances of a well-known config item class. The CollectionItem entry specifies which item class the configuration system should use for a config type. If no ItemClass is specified, the config system defaults it to the globally unique ItemName as described   REF _Ref466379318 \p \h  above RaduP: In current drops the ItemClass attribute is hard coded to  System.Config.Objects.<PublicName>ConfigItem Auto Generated Collection/Item classes (optional) The configuration system can auto-generate configuration collection and/or item classes from the schema definition of a config type.  AutoGenCollectionClass, AutoGenItemClass RaduP: In current drops, there is a  GENERATECONFIGOBJECTS  metaflag on  The AutoGenCollectionClass/AutoGenItemClass* are Boolean flags that indicate if the configuration system should auto matically generate configuration classes. If no AutoGen* flag is specified, the configuration system defaults to   (= do auto-generate the respective class). Should we allow specification of an assembly/DLL name? Yes! Should we support generating source code? In which languages? We wouldn t have to worry about assembly/dll names, changes in IL emit classes etc. OverrideCollectionClass, OverrideItemClass The OverrideCollectionClass/OverrideItemClass are Boolean flags, that indicate if the actual configuration/item classes are going to be custom implementations that derive from the auto-generated classes. If this flag is specified, the name of the generated classes will be appended with a   suffix. Example 1: <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites  ItemName=   <!-- nothing specified: defaults to generate and use two classes:  System.IIS.Sites  System.IIS.Site   --> Example 2:   <Collection  ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites        ItemClass= System.IIS.Config.Site   <!-- generates two classes: System.IIS.Sites System.IIS.Config.Site and declares them as the collection/item classes to use --> Example 3:   <Collection  ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites        Flags= OverrideCollectionClass OverrideItemClass   <!-- generates two classes: System.IIS.SitesBase System.IIS.SiteBase and declares the following two classes as the config classes to use: System.IIS.Sites System.IIS.Config.Site These classes have to be implemented by the config type author, and would typically derive from the generated bases classes to  implement custom Methods that use the standard configuration classes.   --> Example 4:   <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites        AutoGenCollectionClass= False  AutoGenItemClas= False   <!--  Generates no classes  Defaults to using the following two classes as the config classes: System.IIS.Sites System.IIS.SitesItem These classes could store the config data in a custom format, yet implement the IConfigCollection/Item interfaces respectively.   --> SchemaGeneratorFlags EmitXMLSchema EmitCLBBlob Base Version (optional) The base version number of this collection. Each time existing properties are re-ordered (either by re-ordering, inserting new properties, deleting existing properties) or the definition of any existing properties is fundamentally changed, the base version must be incremented.  The version must not change when new columns are added.  Therefore, a version guarantees a well-known subset of properties with well-known definitions. Extended Version (optional) The extended version of this collection: increments whenever collection definition changes. Internal (optional) Flag indicating that this collection is not to be available outside of the configuration system. Only interceptors and the configuration manager can access the collection. How are we going to enforce this? Is this only true for the admin interfaces as opposed to the config manager? <Collection ConfigType= System.Config.PersistedCacheFiles  Internal > NoChangeNotify (optional) Change notification should not be supported on this collection.Should this be a wiring definition? RelationIntegrity (optional) RowIntegrity (optional) NoPublicInsert (optional) NoPublicUpdate (optional) NoPublicDelete (optional) RequiresQuery (optional) Property Definition Every collection has a fixed set of properties. Two names can be specified: Name: the property name is used for programmatic access to the property (i.e. in generated config item classes, etc.). It should be short, but concise. Internal Name (optional): the internal name is used for C++ header filesIf no internal name is specified, the configuration system defaults it to the Name, replacing invalid characters with   (underscore). Property names are scoped within the collection name. They must be unique within the collection. Programmatic and Internal Names are thought to be in different name spaces, i.e. it is possible that the public name of one property has the same string value as the internal name of another property (as long as the second property has a different public name). <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <Property Name= HomeDirectory  InternalName= HOMEDIRECTORY  Type= </Collection> The supported types are: WSTR, fixed or variable length BYTES, fixed or variable length DBTIMESTAMP MULTI_SZ should be a type. ExpandString should be a type. Bool should be a type, not a flag Do we need to support any other types? Size (optional) Indicates the Size of the property in bytes when returned from the config system. The size is only required for fixed size strings and byte arrays. For all other types, including variable size strings and byte arrays, the size definition should be omitted and is calculated by the configuration system. UI4: 4 (defaulted) WSTR: Size=0 indicates variable length (default), Size>0 indicates fixed length (in bytes, not characters!) Is this how we determine variable size properties? BYTES: Size=0 indicates variable length (default), Size>0 indicates fixed length DBTIMESTAMP: 8 (defaulted) GUID: 16 (defaulted) <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <!-- ficticious example: limits size of Bindings property to 512 bytes -->   <Property Name= Bindings  Type= BYTES  Size= </Collection> UIKey (optional) This flag indicates that the value of this property can be used to identify an item instance for UI purposes. Often the UIKey property will be part of the primary key of the item, but it does not have to be unique across items within the collection; it should be  sufficiently unique  for UI purposes. If no property is declared as the UIKey, the UI typically defaults to the Primary Key. <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <!-- Ficticious example: use HomeDirectory in the UI, instead of SiteID -->   <Property Name= HomeDirectory Type= UIKey </Collection> Navigation Property (optional) Primary Key (optional) This flag indicates that the property is to be part of the primary key of this collection. More than one property can be part of the primary key. If no property is designated as part of the primary key, all properties are assumed to be the primary key for the collection (i.e. no primary key validation will be performed). <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <Property Name= SiteID Type= PrimaryKey </Collection> Foreign Key (optional) t we just imply this from relationship information? Default Value (optional) Defines the default value to use for this property if it is not specified in a store, i.e. returned as NULL from the store. <Collection ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites   <!-- ficticious example: defaults the default app pool ID to 1 -->   <Property Name= DefaultAppPoolID Type= DefaultValue= </Collection> StartingNumber/EndingNumber (optional) Defines the permissible values for a numeric property.  If both StartingNumber and EndingNumber are specified, the values of this property must fall within this range, i.e. StartingNumber<= property value <= EndingNumber. If only StartingNumber is specified, the values of this property must be greater or equal to the StartingNumber, i.e. StartingNumber <= property value. If only EndingNumber is specified, the values of this property must be less than or equal to the EndingNumber, i.e. property value <= EndingNumber.   <!-- fictucious example: 10 <= value <= 20 -->   <Property Name= DefaultAppPoolID Type=  StartingNumber=  EndingNumber= CharacterSet (optional) Defines the permissible characters for a string or byte property. <!-- ficticious example: forces HomeDirectory to only be letters --> <Property Name= HomeDirectory  Type=  CharacterSet= abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\: ExcludeCharacterSet (optional) Defines invalid charaters for a string or byte property. <!-- ficticious example: disallows slash and dash and plus in HomeDirectory --> <Property Name= HomeDirectory  Type=  ExcludeCharacterSet= Only one of CharacterSet or ExcludeCharacterSet can be specified for a property. Directive (optional) Declares the property as containing directives. Directives impact the way the collection is rendered by the configuration system. List Merge Interceptors use this property to determine which property contains the  Remove Final  etc. directives. The XML Storage Interceptor will allow this property to be used as the element name instead of the PublicItem name. Do we need to do something special to avoid name collisions in XML files (i.e.   directive in more than on collection)? Bool (optional) Should this be just another type? Flag (optional) Used on Bool properties. Indicates to the XML Storage Interceptor that presence/absence of an attribute should determine the value of the property. Enumeration (optional) Declares the permissible values of a numeric property by enumerating these values, as well as symbolic names that can be used instead of these values.  Does this only work for numeric properties? The UI uses this declaration to populate list/comboboxes etc. The generated config item classes contain fields that are enumerators, instead of numeric values. The XML storage interceptor enforces that values for this property be one of the symbolic names. <Property Name= Access  Type=   <Enum Name= Value=   <Enum Name= Write Value=   <Enum Name= Append Value= </Property> WriteNever (optional) WriteOnChange (optional) WriteOnInsert (optional) NotPublic (optional) Declares this property to be for internal use of the configuration system only. Does this apply only to the admin interfaces or also to config manager? NotDocd (optional) Declares this property to be accessible, but not officially documented (i.e. the property has not been fully tested or may be changed in a future release). Does this apply only to the admin interfaces or also to config manager? PublicReadOnly (optional) Declares this property to be read-only. PublicWriteOnly (optional) Declares this property to be write-only. Typically used for clear-text security credentials. InsertDefault (optional) InsertGenerate (optional) InsertUnique (optional) InsertParent (optional) NotNullable (optional) Declares that this property must carry a non-null value. NotPersistable (optional) MultiString (optional) Should this be a type? ExpandString (optional) Declares that a string property may contain substrings that need to be replaced with environment variable settings. The configuration system performs this expansion by calling the Win32 ExpandEnvironmentStrings function. Should this be specified as a type of it s own? Unknown Size (optional) Variable Size (optional) Index Definition Hierarchy & Relationships Foreign Key relations Hierarchical configuration information Configuration information is often structured in a hierarchical fashion.  Containment Often a parent collection has items to which one or more items in another collection are strict subordinates, i.e. they only exist in the context of the parent item and have no meaning by themselves. To facilitate declaring this kind of collection containment, it is possible to use nesting of collection definitions to express the containment. Example: <Collection ConfigType= Directories   <Collection ConfigType= Scriptmaps     <Property Name= Extension  Type=     <Property Name= Module  Type=   </Collection> </Collection> The contained collection inherits all primary key properties of the containing collection. If more flexible control over the containment relationship is needed, the generic relationship definition (described   REF _Ref466188762 \p \h  below ) can be used. Tree structures Often items in a collection represent the nodes in a tree structure. This is typically represented by defining a  Parent  property, which refers back to the primary key of the same collection. Example (Lightning Codegroups):  INCLUDEPICTURE "CodeGroupHierarchy.gif" \* MERGEFORMAT  Schema: <Collection ConfigType= System.Security.CodeGroup   <Property Name= Type= PrimaryKey    <Property Name= Parent Type=   <-- real properties of CodeGroup --> </Collection> <Relation PrimaryCollection= System.Security.CodeGroup  PrimaryProperties= Parent           ForeignCollection= System.Security.CodeGroup  ForeignCollections=            Example XML: < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= All Code   < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Publisher:Microsoft     < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Name:MS.Office     < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Name:MS.Windows   </ System.Security.CodeGroup >   < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Zone:Internet   < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Zone:Intranet     < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Publisher:CorpAdmin     < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Site:localweb   </ System.Security.CodeGroup >   < System.Security.CodeGroup Name= Site:xyz.com </ System.Security.CodeGroup > Results in the following collection: Parent All Code Publisher:Microsoft All Code Name:MS.Office Publisher:Microsoft Name:MS.Windows Publisher:Microsoft Internet All Code Intranet All Code Publisher:CorpAdmin Intranet Site:localweb Intranet Site:xyz.com All Code Inheritance Do we need to support collection inheritance, i.e. reuse of collection schema? Would we want to apply additional semantics? Query Hints  Schema design guidelines Use separate association collections CIM/WMI strongly recommends this (and uses it in the Win32 and other schemas) to allow items/collections to be related independent from the item/collection definition. Wiring Selecting an Interceptor Chain for a ConfigType <ConfigChain ConfigType= System.IIS.Sites  Chain= System.IIS.Default Instructions to the schema compiler These used to be on the collection meta, but seem to be more driven by wiring decisions (i.e. if you use the CLB interceptor you need CLB blocs, if you use the XML interceptor you need XML blobs). Maybe we can even fully automate this (or at least apply smart defaults)? Instructions to the XML storage interceptor These used to be on the collection meta, but seem to be more driven by wiring decisions (i.e. if you use the CLB interceptor you need CLB blocs, if you use the XML interceptor you need XML blobs). IsContained NotScopedByTablename Managing Schema and Wiring Schema / Wiring compilation XML Schema CLB Schema Header files Collection/Item classes Dynamic schema/wiring discovery XSD representation of Config Schema Configuration schema maps to a subset of XSD. Additional information that has no direct representation in XSD is expressed using schema annotation (additional attributes/elements that have a different namespace). Prototypical examples of configuration information in XML: <configuration> <!-- singleton --> <AppDomain SharedPath= c:\shared  PrivatePath= .;.\bin  ShadowCopy= false <!-- collection --> <foo prop1=  prop2= <foo prop1=  prop2= <!-- scoped collection (BindingPolicy with items BindingRedir) -->  <BindingPolicy>   <!-- only foo elements are valid within the <foos> elemenet -->   <BindingRedir Name= foo.dll  Originator=  Version= 1.0.0.0  NewVersion= 2.0.0.0   <BindingRedir Name= bar.dll  Originator=  Version= 1.0.0.0  NewVersion= 2.0.0.0 </BindingPolicy> singleton (authentication), in a section (security) --> <security>   <authentication mode= Passport </security> singleton (impersonation), nested sections (security, identity) --> <security>   <identity>     <impersonation enable=   </identity> </security> <!-- two scoped collections (compilers, assemblies), in a singleton (compilation) --> <compilation debugmode=   <compilers>     <compiler language=  extension=  type= MSVSA.dll#Microsoft.VB.Compiler     <compiler language=  extension= .cool  type= COOL.dll#Microsoft.COOL.Compiler     <compiler language=  extension=  type=  COOL.dll#Microsoft.COOL.Compiler   </compilers>   <assemblies>     <add assembly= Microsoft.WFC.dll     <add assembly= ADODB.dll     <add assembly="*" />   </assemblies> </compilation> <!-- nested collections/singletons: Policy: scoped collection with items PolicyLevel NamedPermissionSets: scoped collection with items PermissionSet,                               nested within PolicyLevels Permission: (unscoped) collection, nested within PermissionSet FileIOPermission: singleton, nested within Permission <Policy>    <PolicyLevel class= System.Security.Policy.PolicyLevel  version=     <NamedPermissionSets>       <PermissionSet Name="foo"                       Description="The FOO permission set"                      class= System.Security.NamedPermissionSet>         <Permission class= System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission  version=           <FileIOPermission Read= C:\Temp Append="D:\MyFiles\document.doc" />         </Permission>       </PermissionSet>       <PermissionSet Name="bar"                       Description="The BAR permission set"                      class= System.Security.NamedPermissionSet>         <Permission class= System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission  version=           <FileIOPermission Read= C:\Temp " />         </Permission>       </PermissionSet>     </NamedPermissionSets>    </PolicyLevel> </Policy> <!-- two unscoped collections (foo, bar), in a section (section3) --> <section3> <foo prop1=  prop2= <foo prop1=  prop2= <bar prop1=  prop2=  prop3= <bar prop1=  prop2=  prop3= <foo prop1=  prop2= </section3> <!-- mix of collection (<bar>) scoped collection (<foo> in <foos>) singleton (<zee>) in a section (<section4>)  <section4> <foos> <!-- only foo elements are valid within the <foos> elemenet --> <foo prop1=  prop2= <foo prop1=  prop2= </foos> <bar prop1=  prop2=  prop3= <bar prop1=  prop2=  prop3= <zee Prop1=  Prop2= </section4> </configuration> The following BNR-inspired production rules illustrate the structure: configfile := config-info | section config-info := singleton | collection | scoped-collection singleton := 1* (element +attribute nested-config-info) collection := * (element +attribute nested-config-info) scoped-collection := scoping-element ( collection | directive-collection ) directive-collection := *(directive +attribute) section := *section *configtype nested-config-info := config-info ConfigType, Section: element An element declaration in XSD corresponds to A section, iff the element has a cfg:Section=  attribute. A singleton or unscoped collection, iff the element contains exactly one complexType definition or reference. The multiOccur attribute determines if the element corresponds to a singleton (multiOccur= ) or an unscoped collection (multiOccur= unbounded  or not present). A scoped collection, iff the element has no cfg:Section attribute or a cfg:Section= false  attribute and contains exactly one other element that contains exactly one complexType definition. Any other element declaration is not supported and constitutes an error, unless explicitly annotated using the cfg:Ignore attribute. <!-- Example: singleton schema definition --> <element name="AppDomain" maxOccurs= <complexType> <attribute name= SharedPath <attribute name= Privatepath /> <attribute name= ShadowCopy  type= boolean </complexType> </element> <!-- Example: scoped collection schema definition --> <element name="BindingPolicy" > <element name="BindingRedir" maxOccurs= unbounded <complexType> <attribute name= <attribute name= Originator <attribute name= Version <attribute name= NewVersion <attribute name= UseLatestBuildRevision  type= boolean </complexType> </element> </element> <!-- Example: section schema definition --> <element name= security  cfg:Section=   <element name= authentication  maxOccurs=     <complexType>       <attribute name=         <simpleType base= string           <enumeration value=      cfg:Value=           <enumeration value= Windows   cfg:Value=           <enumeration value= Cookie    cfg:Value=           <enumeration value= Passport  cfg:Value=         </simpleType>       </attribute>     </complexType>   </element> </element> Element for a ConfigType definition Attribute Mapping Restriction (Public) Name of the ConfigType Required MaxOccurs if present:   = Singleton unbounded  = collection other value: error (not supported in V1) not present: same as   (singleton), per XSD spec.

Default Error: in the config data model, elements have no value. Block Error: Not supported in V1. Abstract Error: Not supported in V1. Note: Attributes, whose semantics is not enforced in V1, generally cause validation errors to allow the config system to enforce these semantics in future versions. If we did not reject these schema definitions in V1, we could break applications that rely on V1 ignoring/not enforcing the semantics. Config Type annotations: All annotations are usually placed into the   XML namespace using a namespace attribute in the root element of the schema file: <schema xmlns= http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema         xmlns:cfg="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-configuration </schema> Can we support other namespacing or do we require cfg: for V1? Is it possible to put our extensions into the default namespace? Do XML schema and data editors safely ignore the annotations? (VS7 XML designer!).

The way we have done MFLs is that we have the MOFCOMP stage as part of our build process.  What we keep in SD is the "master" MOF, meaning the one with everything in one MOF.  At build time, we generate the MOF and MFL using MOFCOMP.  You hand off the MFLs to localization (we have provided them with a DLL for LocStudio to help with MFLs).    -----Original Message----- From:  Eric Deily   Sent: Friday, August 25, 2000 11:55 AM Michael Maston Subject: RE: Type-B DCR Approved: IIS WMI Provider  Importance: Michael, It looks like we're needing assisntance on splitting the file.  according to your email, I need to just look for any [Description(...)] markers in the MOF included, and make sure to put an AMENDED tag at the end of it, or AMENDMENT, LOCALE(1033) - right?

As long as it identifies the descriptions and display name qualifiers as amended, you are set.  If it doesn't, it is very easy to do and won't affect the structure of the schema or the provider code. Let us know if you need any assist on it.  -----Original Message----- From:  Richard Ersek   Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2000 4:41 PM Michael Maston; Raxit Kagalwala Subject: RE: Type-B DCR Approved: IIS WMI Provider  Ok, I've found a doc that explains this in detail from MSDN.  It pretty much restates what you're saying here.  So it sounds like we convert the mof we have into a version with the basic classes and then create localized mofs with amended classes.  I'm assuming that what we have can be a master mof already but if not, we might need some work.  We're not using any Value qualifiers that I know of so we're basically talking about localizing descriptions and display names.  -----Original Message----- From:  Michael Maston   Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2000 4:29 PM Richard Ersek; Raxit Kagalwala Subject: RE: Type-B DCR Approved: IIS WMI Provider  Our normal localization effort is: 1) Localize any class, property, method, etc. descriptions 2) Localize any VALUES qualifiers  3) Don't put localizable data in the provider 4) Provider should act as a pass-thru for any localized data coming from the data source (in this case the metabase) 5) Don't localize any class, property, method, etc. names 6) Don't localize any of the name of standard qualifiers (read, write, etc.) The way we do this have a "master" MOF file that contains all the English versions of all the localizable text.  We define the localizable qualifiers as "amended".  If you run MOFCOMP with the -MOF and -MFL flags it will split the master MOF into a MOF file without all the localizable data in it and a MFL file that somewhat mirrors the MOF but contains all the localizable data in it.  We have tools for LocStudio that allow localizers to take the MFL and localize it into the various languages.  You ship the MFLs (which are loaded into parallel, locale namespaces).  When a user asks for data (and qualifiers, they are optional by default), WMI looks at their locale and gives them the localized info for their locale. You should probably go over one of our master MOFs with Raxit to see how this all works.  It is fairly simple to add the necessary statements for the amended qualifiers (if they aren't there already).

Introduction The .Net Framework consists of several, tightly integrated and interdependent technologies: Common Language Runtime (CLR) Class Libraries Web Services Net Classes All these technology areas have configurable properties, which are specified in XML configuration files. The different areas use different mechanisms to read their configuration information at system runtime, but a single management APIs allows uniform, programmatic access to all .Net Framework configuration information. The Application Center Configuratiom Management team owns this management API. It and consists of the following building blocks: A native code WMI provider: this provider is schema driven and maps the XML configuration information and the configuration file hierarchy to WMI classes and instances. The provider is developed by the Application Center Configuration Management team, and is described in detail in this specification. A managed code API to access all WMI information (System.Management): this API was designed as a collaborative effort between the WMI team, the Frameworks team and the Application Center team. It is developed by the WMI team and is described in detail in  HYPERLINK "http://wmig/vss/specifications/Quasar/program Management/MiniQuasar WMI+ (PM Spec).doc" the System.Management specification . This specification contains sample code describing the use of System.Management for managing configuration information. Goals Provide a management API for all .NET Frameworks configuration information. Enable Management Application for configuration information to be written in both native code and managed code. Enable management of configuration information through command line scripts. Allow discovery of applications and configuration files through the management API. Allow reading and writing of configuration information. Provide basic consistency validation of configuration information during read and write. Provide a management API for user defined application settings (as offered by the <appsettings> mechanism in the Framework configuration system, and potentially for a set of well-known section handlers). MarkusH: Beyond the dictionary section handler there need to be other reusable section handlers (singleton and collection of singleton). We can make this a sample, but ideally this should be part of the Framework configuration system offering. Non Goals Provide a high-performance API for accessing configuration information at system runtime. This requirement is partially covered by the   HYPERLINK "http://urtframeworks/specs/xsp/configuration_beta2.doc"  Framework configuration system  (read-only in V1). Provide a general-purpose mechanism for application settings. This requirement is partially covered by the section handler mechanism of the Framework configuration system. The management API should allow management of a well-defined subset of application settings. WMI provider for .Net Framework Configuration The WMI provider for .Net Framework Configuration exposes configuration information and configuration file hierarchy to WMI classes and instances. [MSINTERNAL] The class mapping is almost entirely schema driven, but the schema is not publicly extensible: only MS internal groups can define schema and all schema is compiled into the WMI provider binaries. This approach makes it easy to add new configuration entries and modify existing configuration definitions without having to change any code. The schema is defined in a special purpose XML format, that is easier to manually author and maintain than XML schema (XDR and even XSD). [end MSINTERNAL] MSINTERNAL: Schema definition format tbw: The configuration management team owns the schema definition for the .Net config (urtmeta.xml). The schema is defined in XML files, which get compiled into the provider binaries (urtcfg.dll) as part of the configuration system build process. A (ms-internal) utility (catutil.exe) exists to modify the binary schema without recompiling the configuration system binaries. Class Mapping for configuration information The .Net Frameworks Config WMI provider defines all schema in the WMI repository.  The configuration system build process generates a MOF file from the configuration schema (and an internal-only MOF template file), which .Net Frameworks setup installs via the MOF compiler utility. All .Net Frameworks classes reside in the  NETFRAMEWORKSv1  namespace. The namespace is defined in the MOF template file. All non-internal (Metaflag  INTERNAL  on CollectionMeta) configuration tables are exposed into the same WMI namespace, regardless of the database they belong to. The .Net provider does not support side-by-side installation for incremental builds. For major releases we will version the namespace name by changing the MOF template file. The ProductID used to locate the correct config binary version will also be changed and will typically be the same as the namespace name. P2: Currently we read the ProductID as a qualifier from the class definition in the WMI repository. Do we really need to expose this? This avoids the need for script authors to change their scripts from build to build or minor release to minor release. It is consistent with the general versioning approach in the WMI world. MarkusH: We are basing this on the assumption that ASP+ is not s-b-s installable. Need to run this by the .Net people.  P1: MarkusH: Do we need to support scoping of table names by WMI namespace (or database)? In Beta 1, <Assemblies> and <assemblies> conflicted. Assumption is that there will not be conflicting table names.  Configuration base class class NetConfigurationClass { [key] String Selector; Need the exact schema. Data type mapping Schema and data types in the Config system will be mapped to WMI schema and data types as follows: Config System Type WMI Type Collection Class Item in collection Instance Property Property Uint32 String String Multistring Array of strings Binary Array of uint8 Boolean Boolean ExpandSZ (environment variable) String, becomes a boolean qualifier on the property Timestamp Datetime Primary key Foreign key Mapped as a qualifier on the property in the class definition.  Property will be mapped to an appropriate property in the WMI class.  Enumerated types Mapped to appropriate data type and VALUE/VALUEMAP pairs Relations w/ UseContainment Embedded object in the instance Relations w/o UseContainment Association class Enumerated types in the config system have a data type, a set of appropriate values and enumerated values that correspond 1:1 with each value.  These are to be mapped to the appropriate data type, VALUEMAP and VALUE qualifiers in WMI.  For example: In the config system: <Property       InternalName="Zone"                     Type="UI4"      MetaFlags=""> <Enum       InternalName="MyComputer"               Value="0" /> <Enum       InternalName="Intranet"                 Value="1" /> <Enum       InternalName="Trusted"                  Value="2" /> <Enum       InternalName="Internet"                 Value="3" /> <Enum       InternalName="Untrusted"                Value="4" /> </Property> In WMI: uint32 Zone; [ VALUEMAP {  }, VALUES { MyComputer Intranet Trusted Internet Untrusted MarkusH: Is there a better way to expose enums in WMI? What support does System.Management have for the VALUEMAP qualifiers (if any)? MarkusH: Do the Frameworks config APIs define enumeration values for some of these entries? Class naming WMI class names are generated from the public name of the collections.  WMI class names should be case-preserving from the original config system collection name. Should we change the capitalization etc. to comply with WMI conventions? It seems that config files will use camelCasing. Could  we could just make the first character UPPERCASE or do we need more complex mappings (name prefix?)? The config system adopts WMI naming restrictions and case-insensitivity so the provider does not perform any significant translations of schema names between config system and WMI. The following naming restrictions are be enforced in the schema compilation utility: A WMI name must start with a letter Cannot have leading or trailing underscores Only contains letters, digits and underscores as part of the name WMI names are case-insensitive Primary keys can not be Arrays, Real and floating-point numbers, Embedded objects  or characters lower than ASCII 32 (that is, white space characters). P2: StephenR: Does this need to be implemented in catutil? Relations and Associations Relations without a  UseContainment  statement are equivalent to an unnamed association definition.  The name of the association that is created will be built from the names of the two collections that the Relations definition specifies. 1:N relations in the configuration system are supported by supplying a partial primary key as the foreign key.  These need to be mapped appropriately to 1:N associations in WMI. P1: MarcelV: Are we doing the right thing here? Qualifiers Description qualifier The configuration schema allows a  Description  to be defined for tables ( TableMeta.Description ) and columns ( ColumnMeta.Description ). The MOF generator generates a MFL files (MOF files for localization) that contains description qualifiers for the EN locale. The main MOF file does not contain description qualifiers. Localization teams can then pick up the EN MFL and localize it to other languages. This is the standard WMI localization process. DisplayName qualifier Would be nice to support, but is a lower priority. Units qualifier Nice to have, low priority. Password qualifier Should we tag passwords? Mark them as write only? Read/Write qualifiers Read and write qualifiers will be placed by default on all classes. There is no way to detect which classes are read-only vs. read/write from the config system. For .Net all classes are read/write, so this is not a requirement for the .Net provider. Singletons [MSINTERNAL] The provider and MOF generator introduce a  Selector  property to all defined configuration classes. The provider maps the Selector property to the special   query cell where appropriate. Ideally, singleton collections should be handled inside the config system by introducing a  Selector  property on all .Net config classes, so that the provider does not have to do any special work. Due to schedule constraints we leave the current implementation, with the hope of doing code cleanup later, or at least for V2. Collections without Primary Key Multi-instance collections without keys are not required for .Net Framework configuration. Configuration without schema P3 (cut): Need to provide access to raw XML if no schema is available for a configuration node (browsercaps, custom section handlers and potentially custom permissions). Enumeration & Query The provider does not support class enumeration for any configuration class, as this would require enumeration of all configuration files on the machine, which is not useful/practical. The provider supports retrieving instances by key on any class supplied by the provider. The provider supports simple WQL queries but leaves more complex queries to CIMOM to post-filter. MarcelV: WMI only supports returning a super-set of the requested result set (which it them filters). This means that we have to at a minimum parse out the Selector property for every supported query. Can we do this? The provider supports writing of instances. There are no read-only classes. The provider supports creating of instances. The provider supports deleting of instances.   Batch update There will be a special class with a method for batching updates. Signature of the method is as follows: Class BatchEntry [values{"create", "modify", "delete", "retrieve"}, Description("Batch operation to perform: when create-provide an instance, modify-provide an instance, delete-fill in an object path, retrieve-fill in an object path")] uint32 Op; [Description("Instance to be modified or created")] object Inst; [Description("Object (path) to be deleted or retrieved.  For create operations, BatchOperation::ProcessBatch method returns the path for the instance")] string Path; [Description("returns HRESULT of the operation")] uint32 Status; -------------------------------------------------------------------- [abstract, description("Expectation that this will be processed in the order in which the method list is specified.  Derive from this class and implement the method (per provider)")] class BatchOperation { [static] uint32 ProcessBatch([in, out]BatchEntry BatchList[], [in]uint32 flags); uint32 BatchCreate[in]object ObjectList[], [in]uint32 flags, [out]uint32 status[], [out]string Path[]); uint32 BatchUpdate([in]object ObjectList[], [in]uint32 flags, [out]uint32 status[], [out]string Path[]); uint32 BatchDelete([in]string Path[], [in]uint32 flags, [out]uint32 status[], [out]object results[]); uint32 BatchRetrieve([in]string Path[], [in]uint32 flags, [out]uint32 status[], [out]object results[]); P2: MarkusH: We should run this by the WMI team, so that they can update their documentation, and tell people that the batch update is the preferred method of updating data. P2: MarkusH: System.Management should also have special support for this, so that we guide people in the right direction for doing multi-updates. The configuration WMI provider supports multi-updates only of instances of the same class that are written into the same file. Other cases will result in an error. P2: Multi-update of different classes for the same file. P3: Multi-update of different classes into different files. Selectors Selector modeling all happens in the config system: we add a  Selector  property to every config type. The selector property acts as a symbolic name for a physical file (or multiple files). A set of qualifiers is added to the class that indicates which selectors are supported for this class. The following selectors are supported: Web Application Selector (IIS://) Syntax: IIS://localhost/<metabase path> The syntax for the Selector is identical to the moniker supported by the IIS ADSI provider, except that  All Selectors must use  localhost  as the machine name.  All Selectors must refer to a node at or below the root node of an IIS site (w3svc/<siteid>/root). It is not possible to use the path to the site node (w3svc/<siteid>) as a selector, nor is it possible to use to any metabase path outside of the w3svc node. Example:  IIS://localhost/w3svc/1/root Note: This URL is slightly different from the IIS WMI provider approach, which uses only relative paths and models the machine name as a WMI system property (__server), but it is preferable to require the  localhost  string than to define an entirely new URL scheme. Shell Application Selector (shell://) Syntax: shell://<UNC path to module> Example: shell://c:\program files\my company\myapp.exe Configuration File Selector Syntax:   HYPERLINK "file://<filepath"  file://<filepath >[#<location>] This filepath portion of this URL represents a configuration file in the file system. The (optional) location portion represents the Path of a <location> element within a ASP+ configuration file (see <Location> section in the   HYPERLINK "http://urtframeworks/specs/xsp/configuration_beta2.doc"  ASP+ configuration specification  for details). If no location is specified, the selector only references configuration outside of any <location> element in the file. The URL is normalized according to RFC1738 rules (using URLMon s URL manipulation APIs). Specifically: Forward slashes ( ) are supported and converted to backward slashes ( ) before being passed to Win32 file system APIs. File paths containing reserved characters (like  ) must be encoded using standard URL encoding rules (i.e.   must be  Well-known configuration files Machine configuration Syntax: config://localhost Represents the machine configuration file (%CLR Install Dir%\machine.config). MarkusH: What is the registry key/API we can use to determine this location? MarkusH: Is there any configuration that can not be specified in machine.config, but can appear in an app/dir/shell app? Machine security policy Syntax: config://localhost/security Represents the machine security policy file (%CLR Install Dir %\config\security.config). MarkusH: What about enterprise policy (enterprise.config per runtime security admin spec)? User security policy Syntax: config://localhost/security/user Represents the user security policy file ((%userprofile%\ application data\Microsoft\CLR security config\vxx.xx\security.config) for the current calling user identity. Syntax: config://localhost/security/user/<username> Represents the user security policy file (%userprofile%\ application data\Microsoft\CLR security config\vxx.xx\security.config) for the specified user. How do we determine the user profile location on Win9x? Note: Like in IIS s ADSI provider,  http:  URL are not supported as there is no reliable/efficient mechanism to resolve them to the proper IIS vdir. Using   URLs is also not desirable for management tools/scripts, as the URL mapping can change at any time. Note: The previously supported  appdomain://  selector is not supported, as there is no mechanism to detect the application domain of the caller (if any) from within the WMI provider. Location element class Location { [key] String Selector; [key] String Path; Boolean AllowOverride; The Location class represents Location sections that can be used in ASP+ configuration files to specify configuration for a child node in the configuration file of a parent node, as well as lock down the configuration of a child node against accidental or malicious changes. Refer to the   HYPERLINK "http://urtframeworks/specs/xsp/configuration_beta2.doc"  ASP+ configuration spec  for details. The Location Path property is a relative path indicating the child node to which the section is to be applied. The Path segments must be separated using forward slash ( Location elements can only be retrieved or written using a file selector. New location sections can be inserted by creating and saving a new instance of the Location class. An entire location section can be deleted by deleting a Location class instance. Location sections cannot be renamed: the section needs to be deleted and recreated. Configuration entries can be retrieved or written using the #<location> syntax of the file selector, or by using the association from Location class to configuration classes: [Association: DisableOverride ToInstance ToSubClass] class LocationConfiguration: NodeToConfigurationClass {}; Merging and Merge Hierarchies Application Enumeration In addition to manipulating configuration files, the .Net Config WMI provider also supports discovery of .Net applications. The .Net Framework provides three host environments for applications:  Web Applications: ASP+ Shell Applications: command line  Browser hosted  controls The .Net Config WMI provider fully supports discovery of Web Applications, and to a lesser extent of Shell Applications. Base classes Need to turn these definitions into valid MOF syntax Applications and Nodes class ConfigurationNode { [key] String Selector; // must begin with a URL protocol prefix class Application : ConfigurationNode { // "abstract" // Selector: must refer to an application node Configuration information for a node P2: MarkusH: How do we determine which class can be specified at which level (machine vs. app vs. dir vs. file)? Can we use the IIS KeyType? For now assume we don t enforce these restrictions. [Association: DisableOverride ToInstance ToSubClass] class NodeToConfigurationClass { [key, read: ToSubClass] ConfigurationNode ref Node; [key, read: ToSubClass] NetConfigurationClass ref ConfigClass; What is the real name of the base class of the config classes?

Note that this enumeration returns both ASP and ASP+ applications, as there is no robust/efficient mechanism to distinguish between ASP and ASP+ applications. WebApplication instances are read-only, except for creation/deletion of instances:  Creating (and saving) a new instance of WebApplication adds an "Approot" property to the IIS metabase. If necessary it creates a new node in the metabase. If the metabase node is already an  approot , only the Vdir is changed to WebApplication.Path. The ConfigurationFilePath property is ignored on write. MarkusH: Which additional MB entries do we need to create? Do we need to call the WAM APIs? Does ASP+ have any specific requirements as to inproc/oop/pooled? Deleting an instance of WebApplication removes the node and all its child nodes from the metabase. Note: The .Net Provider does not provide control over app properties, like inproc/pooled/out-of-proc, app identify. Use the IIS6 WMI provider (or ADSI on W2k) to manipulate these. WebApplication<config class>, WebApplication<config class>Unmerged Given a WebApplication instance it is common to  Retrieve a specific configuration class/section for the application.  Determine the set of configuration classes/sections applicable to this type of application To make these operations easier, the .Net Config provider associates all configuration classes with WebApplication instances via the Selector property (Selector is a key property on all config classes).  The provider offers two associations for each configuration class: WebApplication<config class>: returns the merged configuration for this application, including configuration information inherited from parent nodes or the machine configuration file. WebApplication<config class>Unmerged: returns only the configuration that is specified in the configuration file for this application. [MSONLY] The applicable configuration classes for a web application are defined in the configuration schema and are used by the MOF generation utility to generate the class definitions for the associations. The provider is also data/schema driven and additional classes and their associations can be added without recompiling the provider or the configuration binaries. MarcelV: Should the provider obtain the association information from the WMI repository (common base class!) or do we want to keep this in binary schema for efficiency reasons? Can we use RelationMeta for this? [end MSONLY] To enable efficient enumeration of all applicable configuration classes, all config class associators derive from common base classes: [Association: DisableOverride ToInstance ToSubClass] class WebApplicationConfiguration : ApplicationConfiguration { [key, read: ToSubClass] WebApplication ref Node; Can a derived association specialize the type of an inherited reference?

Note that this enumeration returns both directories in ASP and ASP+ applications, as there is no robust/efficient mechanism to distinguish between ASP and ASP+ applications. WebDirectory instances are read-only, except for creation/deletion of instances:  Creating (and saving) a new instance of WebDirectory creates a new node in the IIS metabase and sets the Vdir to WebDirectory.Path. If the metabase node is already an  approot , the approot property is removed. If the node is a site, the save fails. The ConfigurationFilePath property is ignored on write and must be NULL. Deleting an instance of WebDirectory removes the node and all it s child nodes from the metabase (fails if the node is not a web directory).

The .Net WMI provider is not extensible to accommodate custom hosts. However, custom host writers can (and should) make their applications discoverable by: Implementing their own WMI provider  Deriving their own classes from the appropriate base classes defined by the .Net Configuration provider. Associate their class with configuration classes and relevant other classes in a manner similar to the WebApplication and ShellApplication classes implemented by the .Net Config provider. Miscellaneous No methods beyond the batch methods are implemented, as there are no management methods exposed in the .Net Framework. For web server management the IIS WMI provider (in Whistler) does provide methods like start/stop/pause etc. Support per-user security for each request. Like any WMI provider the provider impersonates the calling user before attempting any file access. All classes derive from CIM_LogicalElement. General Provider requirements No hard-coded strings that would require localization in the provider. When a method on IWbemServices returns an error, the provider should return an extended status object with any additional information that is available whenever possible.  The provider should use the detailed errors mechanism in the config system to provide verbose error information to the user. Platform Support This provider must be supported on all server platforms that the URT supports. This includes Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Whistler and Whistler IA64. Setup Requirements The provider is set up with the rest of the URT components. The provider DLL is regsvr32 ed and the MOF file compiled into the WMI repository. Setup work in .Net setup has already been done. Globalization The provider should be designed, coded and tested to assure globalization compliance. Performance MarkusH: Need to determine performance requirements: working set, requests per second, updates per second, concurrent updates.

Why Simple Tables, Why The Catalog?) Many development teams depend on configuration information.  Simple tables allow those teams to easily use configuration information without being tightly coupled to and impacted by how and where that information is stored, assembled, updated, verified, managed, and distributed.  Managing configuration for real-world scenarios, especially when those scenarios are inherently distributed or require multiple composable services, is a very complex problem space.  Simple tables do not inhibit the development team tasked with such management from making good choices.  Simple tables help such a team turn those good choices into a shipping solution. Simple tables are architected for the configuration space specifically.  The configuration space in general, and the distributed application management space specifically, has many characteristics which deeply influence design and implementation decisions.  Two distinct and overlapping times exist in this space, runtime and configuration-time, with competing requirements.  Reads occur repeatedly during runtime and from many processes, meaning they must be as fast as possible with minimal working set.  Reads at runtime must never be blocked by writers in (overlapped) configuration time.  Reads at runtime are orders of magnitude more common than writes at configuration time.  While concurrent reader/writers do occur in configuration time, they are rare, and few: nonetheless, they must be supported.  At runtime, performance is king.  At configuration time, rich validation, transactional updates, proper isolation, and security are critical.  Performance and scaling concerns at configuration time revolve around huge units of change and remote administration, making composable transactions and efficient marshaling strategies critical as well. The architecture behind configuration in the COM+ 1.0 Services release, shipping in Windows 2000, is called simple tables v1.  With simple tables, we were able to support a rich configuration schema, utilize (and even change among) multiple data stores under the covers, embed rich configuration logic, merge algorithms, and validation rules without disrupting calling code, and build a configuration architecture which supported efficient remote administration, high performance runtime access, composable configuration transactions, role-based security, and differing levels of isolation at configuration time and runtime.   Collectively, this configuration architecture is referred to as the COM+ 1.0 Catalog.  The end result is that all COM+ services compose and work with each other, deploy together in application units, and are entirely managed via one administration api (with an MMC snap-in built atop that api).  The customer benefit is a dramatically minimized surface area for composition, deployment, and administration of a rich set of composable application services. As a result of simple tables and the catalog, we were able to serve up all necessary configuration at COM activation time / runtime via the catalog.  We were able to deliver attribute-based programming and configuration via a single application-based administration api which encompassed all COM+ services (including activation, syncronization, security, pooling, queuing, events, transactions, load balancing, and IMDB).  Further, we built our administration UI (an MMC snap-in) atop our administration api. COM+ 1.0 Services arose from the dual objectives of uniting COM with MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server) and at the side time expanding and improving upon the set of shipping services from those shipped in MTS.  Earlier versions of the catalog shipped in MTS v1 and v2, where the issues of unified administration, runtime vs. configuration-time, service composition, and application deployment were first tackled or at least realized.  Simple tables were invented to address the lessons learned and problems encountered from that experience.  In MTS, we heavily relied upon the combination of logic and data to deliver our configuration and administration solution.  However, we also realized several problems for which simple tables were invented to solve: We needed a schema from which the administration api and many other pieces of the catalog could be driven.  Our  schema  was then hidden in the code itself as a mix of declarations and code. Changes to that  schema , our registry storage structure, queries, or logic always required new code and usually required rebuilding the product.  Less brittleness and easier extensibility, especially considering the increased number of services (and therefore development teams), was needed. The logic code and the data storage code was blurred together, with the whole being tightly bound to the registry.  We had to de-couple the logic from data storage.  We knew we also had to move out of the registry, so encapsulating location and storage dependencies also became necessary. Converting tables into and out of their marshalling format a column at a time was very inefficient. Transactional updates were not supported and not really possible in the existing infrastructure. Mission And Goals (a.k.a. Why Bother Unifying Configuration And How?) COM+ 1.0 Services, a merger and expansion upon COM and MTS, ships as part of Windows 2000.  The COM+ 1.0 catalog, based upon simple tables v1, unifies the configuration and administration of all its services.  This unification enables composition of those services by application developers, supports deployment of applications and their services, and provides a common administration api and schema over it all.  The end result is a set of application services which work together and a dramatically minimized surface area for the customer. Based upon this success, the catalog team has been chartered with a similar mission in the broader context of the URT (Universal Runtime) and AS (Application Server) products of Project 42.  The danger for the URT product, given that its pieces are being delivered by numerous development teams, is that instead of appearing as a unified platform, it appears as a bunch of pieces which don t work together.  The danger for the AS product, given its job of delivering  abilities  atop the URT platform, is that instead of URT applications just getting better, they appear to be hosted in an entirely different environment.  To avoid these dangers, these products must be unified along the lines of programming model, security, and configuration/administration.  The mission of the catalog team is to unify configuration and administration first within each product and then between those products.  The high-level goals of that mission include: Support a common administration api for reading and writing application and service configuration within a unified schema into which all dependent development teams contribute. Support construction of a common administration user interface built entirely atop the administration api, working tightly with the user interface team. Support application deployment in units encompassing all necessary pieces of the application. Support the composition of the various services provided. Encapsulate configuration logic and storage from development teams consuming pieces of configuration. To fulfill this mission and its high-level goals, the following technical requirements carry forward from simple tables v1 and the COM+ 1.0 catalog: A lightweight, easy to use, easy to implement infrastructure with powerful results.  This means minimal interfaces and methods, with data cached at the point of use, and direct access to the cache whenever possible (no copies).  Implementing and extending must be easy as well, requiring clearly defined semantics.  The results must be powerful: queryable, marshallable, cache-oriented, with batch update semantics, etc.  Datastore independence and transparency, dynamically.  Datastores are a constantly shifting landscape and no datastore provides a one-size-fits-all solution for configuration.  As little code as possible should be tightly coupled to a particular datastore, coupling should be dynamic rather than permanent, and granular. Datastore location independence and transparency.  Configuration is distributed throughout file systems and among computers.  Manipulating configuration  remotely  must be as easy as doing so locally and must have reasonable performance.  Requests which are either location independent or indirected must be supported. Plug-and-play client and server side logic.  Domain specific logic on both the  client  and  server  side is necessary.  This logic must be transparently plug-able and storage format independent. A scalable and reliable infrastructure.  Scalability and reliability are critical and must be built in.  We dogfood our own product technologies (e.g. security and transactions) to help achieve this. Simple Tables v2 and the Project42 catalog are an evolution, not revolution, of the v1 design and implementation.  The architecture, interfaces, and implementation predominantly derive from v1.  The changes are experience-driven.  The driving technical goals behind the v2 evolution are: A developer, versed in C and familiar with COM interface concepts, can read the first dozen pages of this spec and then start using simple tables productively. The lines of code and number of method calls necessary to do useful work is minimal. In developer drops, the schema (a.k.a. meta) can be extended without the source. All parts of the catalog, including the administration api, will dynamically adapt to evolving schema. The meta database is enriched to fully support the administrative api, deployment, and monitoring. Meta and wiring changes occur via one file; a build automatically updates dependent files. New datastores and logic can be plugged in dynamically, without catalog source, with minimum coding. The interfaces and semantics allow for maximum performance and minimum working set. The few cache implementations in the catalog are radically fast and leveraged by all data and logic tables. Performance targets (for minimal cycles, minimal working set, and solid scaling) are part of the specification and the bar is set high.  Icecap profiling occurs on an ongoing basis. Technical Summary (a.k.a. For People Who Don t Want To Read A Technical Specification) Configuration is modeled as a set of related tables.  Each uniquely configurable entity (such as sites, applications, components, computers, clusters, and so forth) is represented by a table with a discoverable schema.  Each row in the table represents a configuration instance (such as a particular site, application, etc).  The columns represent the configuration properties on the instance.  The relationships among configuration tables are also discoverable and properly maintained (e.g. when you delete a site all of the related configuration should be cleaned up too).  In object parlance, tables of rows with columns would be referred to as collections of objects with properties. Part I: Using Simple Tables: All configuration tables are obtained via a table dispenser.  You obtain a table by specifying the table s identity (e.g.: application configuration), a query for selecting which rows you want (e.g.: all the applications in some particular site), and a level-of-service expectation.  Given this information the table dispenser gives you a simple table object.  The table dispenser matches your request with an object which encapsulates all the implementations necessary for servicing your request.  This binding process is flexible to fault in implementations which know how to deal with how and where the configuration is stored, which know how to merge, validation, and act on the configuration, and which meet the service requirements of the caller.  The table dispenser encapsulates the magic of this binding process from the caller.  The binding process is dynamic and request driven. Simple tables have a small and common set of methods, so one table looks like any other table.  What differentiates them is their schema and content.  Conceptually a simple table object encapsulates a read cache containing the results of your query, a write cache in which your pending changes accumulate, and the particular pieces of code which know how to store, retrieve, merge, validate, act on, and serve up the requested configuration.  Only executing a query or committing accumulated changes results in storage interaction (which may go out of process or off machine).  Simple table objects can be implemented extremely efficiently. Part II: Schema Evolution: A configuration system has a lot of interesting meta information.  What are the tables, what is their schema, what are their relationships, supported queries, and so forth?  The meta database answers to these sorts of questions.  The meta database is accessible via simple tables and is dynamically extensible.  Therefore, meta information is discoverable.  Configuration schema evolves throughout a product life cycle.  Code which does not adapt to this schema evolution is brittle.  Discoverable meta information makes possible a configuration and runtime system which dynamically adapts to schema evolution throughout the product life cycle.  The catalog expresses meta in a human editable XML format. Part III: Storage and Logic: The table dispenser binding process allows plugging in new storage and logic under-the-covers on a granular basis (per database, table, column, etc).  The table dispenser begins by asking a set of implementation dispensers which one of them knows how to store and retrieve the requested configuration.  This allows pieces of configuration to be distributed among differing stores and allows the same configuration to be stored in different formats (e.g. XML, INI files, or the metabase).  Once one of these dispensers has served up an implementation, the table dispenser then asks another set of implementation dispensers individually if they want to intercept calls on this request.  This process allows chaining together the right set of implementations for the specific request.  New storage and new logic can be plugged in by implementing an object with three methods. Part IV: The Catalog: The catalog consists of the services and functionality built atop simple tables.  Examples:  The managed code configuration objects publicly exposed in the URT, atop which the Application Server user interface and other administration tools will be built. Qualifiable and transient change notification support for any and all configuration tables. Configuration cookdown strategies which optimize performance in key scenarios. Inheritance for defaults and policy with support for common directives. Role-based security and composable transaction support. Side-by-side support for multiple products, versions, and distributed administration scenarios. These services and extra functionality are all dynamically driven from meta information, so that they automatically adapt to schema changes during the product life cycle.  Besides services and functionality provided by the catalog team, dependent development teams can easily evolve their own schema, plug-in their own stores and logic, and build specific services and functionality. Roadmap (a.k.a. How Many Pages of this Spec Do I Need to Read?) This is a detailed technical specification of simple tables and the catalog.  If unfamiliar with basic database concepts, read "Appendix A: Basic Database Vocabulary" before proceeding.  If you are already a simple table guru and just want to find out what changed, read  Appendix C: Changes from Simple Tables v1 .  Note that all examples in this spec are done in C, most examples are complete, and error handling is omitted for brevity. People do one or more of the following with simple tables (from most to least common):  Use simple tables to read and write configuration information (by far the most common!). Evolve the configuration schema (by adding new table schemas or extending existing ones). Plug in a new datastore or new table-specific logic (note that simple tables encapsulate data storage and table logic from callers, and also encapsulate data storage from logic). Understand how specific pieces of the catalog work (like transactions, security, notifications, etc). This spec is organized according to these types of work.  Each type of work is detailed in its own portion of this document with sections which first introduce and present how to do the work followed by relevant detailed reference sections.  Reading the first couple sections of each part should give a solid and reasonably deep technical overview. Learn how to use simple tables in Part I: Using Simple Tables.   Obtaining Simple Tables  introduces how to retrieve tables of information without infecting your code with the details of where that information came from and how it was assembled.   Reading From Simple Tables  and  Writing Via Simple Tables  introduce how to work with a table of information once you have obtained it.  Having introduced query for, reading from, and writing via simple tables,  Important Conclusions  wraps up with the main ideas.  Reading just these sections will give you a solid technical understanding of using simple tables.  You can start coding at this point.  Of course, to truly leverage simple tables, you will want some understanding of how meta, storage, and logic work (see Part II and Part III descriptions below).  Detailed reference information about using simple tables is covered in "Reference: Using The Table Dispenser",  Reference: Reading From Tables Reference: Writing Via Tables , and  Reference: Advanced Table Usage Learn how to evolve the configuration schema and write code which dynamically adapts to schema evolution in Part II: Schema Evolution.   Extending Schema  illustrates how to extend existing schema.   Dynamic Schema Adaptation  demonstrates how to write code which adapts dynamically to schema evolution, since schema evolves throughout the development cycle.  The first reference section,  Reference: The Meta Database , documents the meta database exposed via simple tables, and details the meta information available on databases, tables, relationships, columns, queries, etc.  Code which dynamically adapts to schema evolution does so by making use of the (fast!) meta database at runtime.  The second reference section,  Reference: The Meta Source , documents the XML-based source file for specifying meta.  This section also covers the meta compiler which consumes and validates that source and produces the meta database as well as schemas for the core storage engines in the catalog. Learn how to plug-in new datastores, add rich logic, and fault-in the right implementation for the job in Part III: Stores And Logic. Callers obtain tables from the table dispenser by specifying the table identity, a query, and a requested level of service.   The Wiring Process  introduces how the right implementation, datastore, and logic are wired up to satisfy these requests.   Easily Plugging In Stores  and  Easily Plugging In Logic  respectively introduces how you can easily plug new stores into the catalog and how you can plug new (store independent) validation and action logic into existing tables.   Virtual Tables  introduces you to some of the more advanced possibilities with simple tables, including: query resolution, virtual views, arbitrary interception, and layered logic.   The first reference section,  Plug-ins, Implementation Dispensers, and Table Implementations , details the interfaces and semantics store and logic implementers must obey.  Note that plug-ins are sufficient for most implementers, implementation dispensers might be necessary for very advanced possibilities, and full table implementations are very rare.   The Wiring Configuration, Cookdown, and Database  details the XML-based configuration file from which the cookdown utility generates the wiring database.   Table Control Usage  details the powerful controller interface which assists store and logic implementers. <todo> The catalog core consists of the table dispenser, the meta and wiring databases, the meta and wiring configuration and cookdown utility, and a core of cache and storage implementations.  The rest of the catalog leverages this core to provide the infrastructure necessary to achieve the mission of unified configuration and administration.  Learn about the catalog as a whole in Part IV: The Catalog. Managed code simple table wrappers Configuration interfaces Configuration cookdown Notifications The administration process, catalog server, and default client table Side-by-side catalogs Performance requirements regdb: transactions, version snapshots table integrity security transactions </todo> Appendix B details important design decisions for posterity and the curious.  Only primary developers of the infrastructure need familiarize themselves with the whole spec.  See the  Testing  worksheet in the cat42work.xls workbook for test cases. Part I: Using Simple Tables Obtaining Simple Tables (a.k.a. Who Cares from Whence the Data Comes?) So far as the caller is concerned, all simple tables are obtained through a single table dispenser.  Under the covers though, 0 or more other pieces of code may participate in binding in the appropriate datastore, logic, and implementation.  In this manner, the caller s datastore-independent request can be bound to one or more datastore implementations.  Rich and specific logic can be faulted in to produce the necessary view, validate changes, and enforce required update rules.  And an implementation appropriate to the job at hand can be chosen, like the smallest and fastest caching implementation available for reading configuration at runtime, or a sophisticated implementation serving up remote configuration for an administrative UI.  The table dispenser encapsulates this process of binding in datastores, logic, and implementations. This encapsulation approach allows callers to understand and consume their configuration as one or more "virtual" databases.  Therefore, virtually all code in a product dealing with configuration is storage-agnostic.  Code executing as part of the system at runtime can focus on its job because the cooking, merging, converting, and validating of configuration occurs under-the-covers.  This allows us to migrate toward better datastores, choose different storage for different scenarios, project configuration assembled from different stores as a unified whole, integrate rich querying, viewing and update logic, and improve the implementations used in particular scenarios, all without disrupting existing calling code.  (While the dispenser's query support is certainly rich enough to specify exactly the store from which you expect your data, doing so defeats the purpose, and in most cases is inappropriate.) The caller obtains the table dispenser via a top-level api call, GetSimpleTableDispenser.  Thereafter, all simple table work occurs via components and interfaces.  Once the caller has a table dispenser, they request tables via its ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable method.  To obtain a simple table using GetTable, they specify a  virtual  database and table identity, a query, and a level of service.  In other words, the caller says  I want this table  (the identity),  I want the rows in the table which match this criteria  (the query), and  I expect the following services and behaviors  (the level of service).  Callers work with all simple tables via a small and common set of interfaces.  In any given table instance, the columns are determined by the identity specified, the rows are determined by the query specified, and the underlying implementation is determined (in part) by the level of service.  The table dispenser allows multiple query formats, not just strings, like SQL, but structures too, like ISAM keys, or OLEDB query cells, etc.  Pragmatically, choosing one query format for an entire project, simple enough to be supported atop all data stores, and rich enough to support the required queries, simplifies implementation a lot.  For COM+ 1.0, OLEDB query cells, a structural means of OR'ing within column and AND'ing across columns, was chosen. A query passed to the dispenser has 3 parts: the query data, the query meta, and the query format indicator.  The query data and meta depend on the format.  For a SQL query string, the query format indicator would be eST_QUERYFORMAT_SQL, the query data would be the SQL string, and no query meta would be necessary.  For OLEDB query cells, the query format is eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, the query data is an array of query cells, and the query meta points to the count of cells in the array.  Each cell specifies a column, operator, and data.  For example: to search the components table for all components owned by applications (as opposed to all components not in any application), the column of interest would be the owning application identity (eg: iCFGCOMP_APPLID), the operator would be inequality (ie: eST_OP_NOTEQUAL), and the data would be NULL (ie: no application specified).  This query cell can be combined with others to express more complicated queries. The level of service is requested via a set of flags.  These flags (or lack thereof) indicate whether the caller expects to only read or read and write, what isolation level the caller expects, and so forth.  The flags allow the dispenser to choose the right implementation for the job.  Obviously the level of service affects the level of performance.  In general, the richer the service expectation, the lower the potential performance.  For example, an implementation which only reads information can be done more efficiently than one which reads and writes.  Specifying a higher level of service requires specifying a flag.  Therefore, specifying no flags (which is the most common scenario) provides the lowest level of service with the highest potential performance.  The dispenser transparently binds in the appropriate implementation based on the requested level of service. The following code snippet (error handling omitted in samples), demonstrates a query for all server applications  within a particular cluster.  The caller is a configuration api which is consumed by a multi-window user interface: they expect a read-write implementation and plan to do configuration work: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; CComPtr<ISimpleTableWrite2> pISTWrite; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {L"MyCluster", eST_OP_EQUAL, iST_CELL_CLUSTER, DBTYPE_WSTR, 0} ,  {fAPPTYPE_SERVER, eST_OP_EQUAL, iAPP_TYPE, DBTYPE_UI4, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); HRESULT hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_APPSERVER, 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_APPSERVER, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  fST_LOS_READWRITE | fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK, (void**) &pISTWrite // Use the table here... The caller builds an array of two query cells (aMyQuery).  The first cell specifies that the cluster of interest (i.e. iST_CELL_CLUSTER) is (i.e. eST_OP_EQUAL)  MyCluster .  The second cell specifies that the caller is only interested in server applications (i.e. iAPP_TYPE is the application type, and fAPPTYPE_SERVER denotes server applications). The caller obtains the table dispenser (pISTDisp) from GetSimpleTableDispenser by specifying their product ID (ePRODUCT_APPSERVER).  Each product team using the catalog receives a product ID.  Catalog drops operate side-by-side.  Suppose two independent teams are picking up differing drops on differing schedules, and suppose both their products are commonly installed on the same computer.  The side-by-side support means that neither team breaks the others product by picking up incompatible catalog drops. The caller requests their simple table by calling GetTable on the dispenser.  They specify a virtual database and table (the applications table, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS, from the application server configuration database, wszDATABASE_APPSERVER).  They specify their query.  And they request a read-write implementation appropriate for configuration work (fST_LOS_READWRITE | fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK).  They receive a simple table (pISTWrite) which contain the rows matching their query and supports their requested level-of-service. Now consider a very similar sample.  This time, the caller is some activator code during runtime, residing on one of the servers in the cluster, and just wanting to read quickly obtain the configuration information for all applications on the computer: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTRead; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {fACT_SERVER, eST_OP_EQUAL, iAPP_ACTIVATION, DBTYPE_UI4, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); HRESULT hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_APPSERVER, 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_APPSERVER, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  (void**) &pISTRead // Use the table here... The means of obtaining the table is almost identical to the previous sample.  The caller does not specify a cluster in their query because they are not cluster aware.  They are simply a part of the system on one of the computers in the cluster.  The caller also does not make any level-of-service requests, since all they need is to execute the query and read the results, and they simply want the best possible performance doing so.  The caller obtains an ISimpleTableRead2 interface instead of ISimpleTableWrite2 (the latter inherits from the former). While the two samples look very similar, the binding process under-the-covers is dramatically different.   In the first sample, the caller is requesting configuration from the  single-system-image  of a cluster.  The single-system-image is stored using a clustered SQL Server to guarantee robustness, scalability, and availability of this valuable resource.  This database is on a remote computer.  Under the covers, an implementation which supports the rich service level requested is chosen.  The chosen code knows how to lookup the cluster name in a directory service, determine the computer on which the single-system-image database resides, connect to the administrative process running on a remote computer, and efficiently marshal query results and changes back and forth.  The administrative process on the target computer subsequently faults in the right implementation for interacting with SQL Server, and the right validation logic to verify changes made to application configuration.  The configuration information for hundreds of server applications is supplied as a result of the query. In the second sample, the configuration comes from a very fast and compact persisted cache file which is memory mapped as a read-only shared file.  A minimal read-only implementation which sits directly atop this shared memory is chosen.  The persisted cache happens to have been built from a cluster image.  The configuration information for dozens of server applications is quickly supplied. At this point, understanding the details of either binding process is not necessary.  Suffice it to say that potentially a lot or a little (in terms of number of cycles) went on under the covers to bind the appropriate implementation and extract the requested information from the appropriate datastore.  While the calling code of both scenarios is very similar, the under-the-covers binding process differs dramatically. Reading From Simple Tables (a.k.a. Let's Keep The Lower Layers Small and Fast) Simple tables are always obtained via the table dispenser.  But what exactly is underneath the simple table interface, provided by the dispenser, in response to your query?  Underneath the interface is conceptually a cache, called the read cache, containing the table of rows resulting from the query.  The caller interacts with the read cache via the ISimpleTableRead2 interface.  The caller can also make changes.  These changes conceptually go into the write cache.  The caller makes changes via the ISimpleTableWrite2 interface.  ISimpleTableWrite2 inherits from the read interface, so the caller can read and make changes through one interface.   Once the caller obtains a simple table, they work with the table in-process and in-memory, disconnected from the datastore.  Only two calls actually cause the simple table to temporarily re-bind to its datastore, which may involve going out of process or off machine.  ISimpleTableAdvanced::PopulateCache() re-executes the query specified when the simple table was obtained, flushing then reloading the read cache with the new results.  ISimpleTableWrite2::UpdateStore() flushes the changes accumulated so far in the write cache out to the datastore.  Populating and updating typically hits the disk, and depending on the query and level of service, may also go out-of-process or off machine.  This approach of bulk reads and writes has many advantages.  Most of the work a caller does with a simple table occurs in process, getting the disk and network performance bottlenecks out of the way.  This enables efficient interaction with remote stores by dramatically reducing the roundtrips involved, and facilitates the atomicity, consistency, and isolation requirements for transactional updates. The read cache contains the resulting rows which matched your query.  Queries either ask for a specific individual entity or a set of them.  So if your query asked for a particular application, the read cache would contain one row for that one application (or none), whereas if your query asked for all applications within a particular site, the read cache would contain as many rows as there were applications in the site.  You can think of the read cache as an  array  of rows into which you can index.  The column values of a particular row can be read one at a time, all at a time, or a specific set at a time.  To read column values of a particular row, you specify the row index of interest. When requesting a column value, rather than copying the value from the cache, the simple table actually gives you a pointer to the value in the cache.  So for example, when requesting a string value, you get a pointer to the string rather than a copy of it.  This approach eliminates unnecessary allocations and copies.  If you pass some data to a customer outside your product, you had better use the more common approach of copying that data, so that they own the data they use, and control its lifetime.  But as that data floats around inside your product, you should have the option to not allocate and copy each time it passes from layer to layer, since this can become very expensive in real products.  Consider how many allocations and copies this approach saves when doing a little simple remote administration.  Data moves from the datastore, to a layer which transforms it, to a layer which marshals it, to a layer on the client-side, to the administration layer, and finally to the customer.  The marshalling infrastructure itself obviously copies the data, and the administration api must copy the data before handing it out.  But by not otherwise copying it, we can typically save at least half a dozen allocations, copies, and de-allocations. This approach of pointing you to values rather than giving you your own copies means you can use the values, but you don't own them, you must not overwrite them, and if you want to keep them after either re-populating or releasing your simple table, you first need to make your own copy.  Simple tables were designed to meet the configuration needs of commercial products, not for the masses of VB developers.   Here is an example where the caller wants to print the description of an application given its URL: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTRead; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {L http://bar/foo , eST_OP_EQUAL, iAPP_URL, DBTYPE_WSTR, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); HRESULT static const ULONG aiAppColumns [] = { iAPP_DESCRIPTION }; WCHAR* wszAppDescription; hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_URT, 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_URT, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  0, (void**) &pISTRead hr = pISTRead->GetColumnValues (0, 1, aiAppColumns, NULL, (void**) &wszAppDescription); if (S_OK == hr) wprintf (L description: %s , wszAppDescription); You should already understand the GetSimpleTableDispenser and ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable calls from previous examples.  Note that GetTable asks for the application configuration at  /bar/foo .  The new call is ISimpleTableRead2::GetColumnValues.  The first parameter specifies the row index of interest: 0.  Since the caller knows their query can only result in 0 or 1 rows, they specify row index 0, the first row in the resulting read cache.  GetColumnValues will return E_ST_NOMOREROWS if a row does not exist, meaning in this case that the application was not found.  The second parameter specifies how many column values the caller wants: 1.  Here is the caller is only interested in the description.  The third parameter specifies the array of column values of interest: in this case just the description.  The final parameter is the address of the string pointer which will be pointed to the application description.  The caller prints the resulting application description. Here is a similar example where the caller wants to print a set of specific properties, instead of just one, of an application given its URL: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTRead; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {L /bar/foo , eST_OP_EQUAL, iAPP_URL, DBTYPE_WSTR, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); HRESULT static const ULONG aiAppColumns [] = {  iAPP_NAME,  iAPP_DESCRIPTION,  iAPP_SITEID static const ULONG cAppColumns = sizeof (aiAppColumns) / sizeof (ULONG); static const ULONG cmaxAppColumns = iAPP_SITEID + 1; void* apvAppValues [cmaxAppColumns]; hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_URT, 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_URT, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  0, (void**) &pISTRead hr = pISTRead->GetColumnValues (0, cAppColumns, aiAppColumns, NULL, apvAppValues); if (S_OK == hr) wprintf (L name: %s, description: %s, site ID: %d (WCHAR*) apvAppValues[iAPP_NAME],  (WCHAR*) apvAppValues[iAPP_DESCRIPTION], (ULONG) *apvAppValues[iAPP_SITEID]); What are the interesting changes in the GetColumnValues call from the previous example where the caller fetched one value?  Recall that the second parameter specifies the number of column values the caller wants and the third parameter specifies which columns as an array of column indexes.  So far this call looks the same as the previous example, except that more than one column value is being requested.  The real difference is the final parameter.  Here the caller passes an array of pointers.  This array must be big enough to receive all column values from column index 0 to the biggest column index of interest.  However only the pointers requested are supplied.  Very efficient and direct access to the individual values is the result, as the printf usage makes clear. Here is a final and more generic example of fetching column values.  This example differs from the two above in some important ways.  First, the query no longer identifies one specific application.  The query requests all applications under the microsoft.com site.  Second, the caller wishes to obtain all the column values instead of just a few.  Third, rather than assuming how many column values exist, the caller asks the table: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTRead; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {L microsoft.com , eST_OP_EQUAL, iAPP_SITE, DBTYPE_WSTR, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); HRESULT ULONG cColumns, iRow; void** apvAppValues; hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_URT, 0, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_URT, wszTABLE_APPLICATIONS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  0, (void**) &pISTRead hr = pISTRead->GetTableMeta (NULL, NULL, NULL, &cColumns); apvAppValues = new (void*) [cColumns]; for (iRow = 0; ; iRow++) hr = pISTRead->GetColumnValues (iRow, cColumns, NULL, NULL, apvAppValues); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS) break; // Do stuff with the values here delete [] apvAppValues; Notice that the code above, while doing a lot more than the previous example, is of similar line count the previous example.  By now you should be pretty familiar and bored with the GetSimpleTableDispenser and GetTable calls.  Note the query requests all applications under the microsoft.com site.  Once the caller has the resulting table, they call GetTableMeta to obtain column count.  Then they allocate an array of pointers large enough for all the column values in a row.  Rather than just calling GetColumnValues on row 0, they call GetColumnValues in a loop on all rows beginning with index 0 and continuing until E_ST_NOMOREROWS is returned.  For the second parameter, the ask for all column values.  The third parameter, an array of column indexes of interest, is unnecessary and therefore NULL.  The caller just wants all column values from column index 0 to cColumns - 1.  Each call fills their pointer array with pointers to the column values of the requested row.  What exactly is done with the column values is left as an exercise to the reader.  Suffice for now to say that simple tables support rich enough meta such that a generic caller like the one above can properly work whatever values it receives. The morbidly curious are by now no doubt wondering about the fourth parameter to GetColumnValues, which has been NULL in the examples above.  The caller can specify an optional array to obtain the size of each value.   Most column types are fixed sized.  Even for types whose size can vary, like strings and bytes, the schema for such a column often specifies some fixed or maximum length size anyway.  Even when the size truly varies, you don't always need to know it (e.g.: you usually don't need to know the size of string to use the string).   Writing Via Simple Tables (a.k.a. Minimizing Round Trips and Disk Hits) Having done a bit of reading with simple tables, now let s do some writing.  The ISimpleTableRead2 interface pointer conceptually encapsulates a read cache.  The ISimpleTableWrite2 interface pointer conceptually encapsulates both a read and write cache.  But what does the write cache contain?  The read cache contains rows resulting from executing a query.  The write cache contains row changes made by the caller.  Each row in the write cache represents either a deletion of an existing row, an update to an existing row, or an insertion of a new row.  Changes accumulate in the write cache until ISimpleTableWrite2::UpdateStore is called, which applies the pending changes to the datastore.   Suppose a computer has a protocol list and each protocol has configuration.  Now suppose I want to replace the protocols on one computer with the protocols from another.  I need to remove the existing protocols on the destination computer and copy the source computer s protocols to the destination computer.  Assuming I am working on a third computer, the following code accomplishes this work in only three roundtrips: CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp = NULL; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTRead = NULL; CComPtr<ISimpleTableWrite2> pISTWrite = NULL; STQueryCell aMyQuery [] = { {NULL, eST_OP_EQUAL, iST_CELL_COMPUTER, DBTYPE_WSTR, 0} }; ULONG cMyQueryCells = (sizeof (aMyQuery) / sizeof (STQueryCell)); ULONG iReadRow, iWriteRow, cColumns, cVersion, cColumns2, cVersion2; ULONG* acbSizes; void** apvValues; HRESULT hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_APPSERVER, 0, &pISTDisp); // Roundtrip and disconnect to rcraig0 to retrieve all protocols: aMyQuery[0].pvData = L"rcraig0"; hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_APPSERVER, wszTABLE_PROTOCOLS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK, (void**) &pISTRead // Roundtrip and disconnect to rcraig1to retrieve all protocols: aMyQuery[0].pvData = L"rcraig1"; hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( wszDATABASE_APPSERVER, wszTABLE_PROTOCOLS,  (void*) aMyQuery, (void*) &cMyQueryCells, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS,  fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK | fST_LOS_READWRITE, (void**) &pISTWrite // Determine column count dynamically and verify source and destination version compatibility: hr = pISTRead->GetTableMeta (&cVersion, NULL, NULL, &cColumns); hr = pISTWrite->GetTableMeta (&cVersion2, NULL, NULL, &cColumns2); assert (cVersion == cVersion2 && cColumns == cColumns2); acbSizes = new ULONG [cColumns]; apvValues = new (void*) [cColumns]; // Delete all the protocols on the destination (none of this work leaves the caller s process): for (iReadRow = 0;; iReadRow++) hr = pISTWrite->AddRowForDelete (iReadRow); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS) break; // Copy all the protocols from the source to the destination (none of this work leaves the caller s process): for (iReadRow = 0;; iReadRow++) hr = pISTRead->GetColumnValues (iReadRow, cColumns, NULL, acbSizes, apvValues); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS) break; hr = pISTWrite->AddRowForInsert (&iWriteRow); hr = pISTWrite->SetColumnValues (iWriteRow, cColumns, NULL, acbSizes, apvValues); // Roundtrip and disconnect to rcraig1 to apply the protocol changes: hr = pISTWrite->UpdateStore (); delete [] apvValues; delete [] acbSizes; In this example, two instances of the same table are obtained, each from a different computer.  The query indicates the computer.  The computer name is omitted from the query declaration and specified immediately prior to each GetTable call.  We are doing configuration work here and want to insure a proper level of service, so fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK is requested on both tables.  fST_LOS_READWRITE is requested on the destination since we will be writing to that instance.  Note that if we were not going to delete the existing protocols on the destination, we could also specify fST_LOS_UNPOPULATED to save query execution cost, since we would be simply writing rather than reading and writing to the destination table.   The two GetTable calls result in a roundtrip to each remote computer.  These roundtrips are disconnected by design: no connection remains when GetTable returns.  The UpdateStore call at the very end results in  a final roundtrip and disconnect to the destination computer.  All the code in between remains in process with the caller. Once the tables are obtained, the caller uses GetTableMeta to verify they are of common version and to dynamically determine their column counts.  The caller next removes all existing protocols from the destination using AddRowForDelete.  AddRowForDelete takes a row index into the read cache and adds that row to the write cache, marking it for deletion.  The caller iterates over all protocols from the destination, marking each one for deletion. Now the caller needs to transfer all the protocols from the source to destination.  They iterate over all protocols from the source.  For each protocol, they use GetColumnValues to obtain the protocol properties from the source.  Then they use AddRowForInsert to add a blank protocol to the destination write cache.  AddRowForInsert returns the row index to the new row in the write cache.  The caller uses this row index to transfer all the properties from the current source protocol into the new destination protocol.  The caller continues until they run out of source protocols (i.e. the source table returns E_ST_NOMOREROWS). Finally, UpdateStore is called on the destination table.  This pushes the contents of the write cache, all the deletions and insertions included, into the appropriate store on the destination computer. In the sample above, each time we inserted a new protocol into the destination table we set all its properties (which we got from the source table).  In general though, many columns have default values, so specifying everything when inserting a new row is typically unnecessary.  The underlying table implementation can automatically apply defaults from simple table meta.  The meta (a.k.a. schema) for simple tables is also rich enough to automatically handle a majority of validations (e.g. type validation, verifying a specified set of flags falls within the expected mask, insuring a specified enumeration is one of the expected enumerations, and so forth).  The underlying implementation might also be written to apply defaults via inheritance, policy specified elsewhere, and so on.  The magic of the table dispenser is that the right implementation(s) for the job at hand will be bound underneath. More sophisticated validations can also occur when UpdateStore is called.  These validations may include cross-column and even cross-row checks performed before the roundtrip is even taken.  They may also include further security and storage related validations at the  other end  of the roundtrip, and can even kick off actions.  When errors do occur, simple tables support a straightforward detailed error mechanism supporting row and even column granularity, so callers can determine exactly what went wrong.  Again, the right implementations, potentially at both  , is bound in via the magic of the table dispenser. By now you probably realize the write cache is almost exactly like the read cache.  Instead of containing rows which resulted from executing a query, it contains pending row changes.  The write cache, unlike the read cache, marks each row with a pending action.  The actions include insert, delete, and update (and ignore, which we won t discuss here).  AddRowForInsert adds to the write cache a new default row marked for insertion.  AddRowForDelete copies the specified row from the read cache to the write cache marked for deletion.  AddRowForUpdate, not called in the example above, copies a specified row from the read cache to the write cache, marked for update.  Other more advanced means exist for manipulating the write cache not covered here. You may have noticed that deleting a set of rows occurs by executing a query to retrieve that set of rows and then marking the resulting rows for deletion.  This approach can be more expensive than a deletion query, which can be done in one instead of two roundtrips.  However, simple tables encapsulate arbitrarily rich logic (potentially embedded underneath any method).  Simple tables also support detailed error information.  Deletion query support, while certainly possible, is more complicated in this environment.  Thus two roundtrips occur instead of one, but only one query execution typically results. Important Conclusions (a.k.a. Some Final Food For Thought) Before wrapping up, a brief mention regarding concurrency is appropriate.  Simple tables have well-defined concurrency semantics.  These semantics by design and necessity put some locking burden on sophisticated concurrent callers.  However the same semantics allow that in the significantly more common scenarios where locking is either not necessary or already occurs at a higher level, further unnecessary locking is avoided.  Details on concurrency semantics are covered in the reference section on advanced table usage. By now you probably realize that simple table semantics are heavily influenced by competing themes: keep the interfaces simple, make the interfaces powerful, and keep the lower layers fast.  Because values are referenced rather than copied and callers requiring complex concurrency must participate in locking, simple table programming is not for the masses.  When customers interact with configuration, copies must be made and locks must be taken: simple tables allow this to be done at just the highest layer instead of being repeated all the way down through the internal layers of a commercial product. Simple tables allow for an efficient infrastructure which the internal code of commercial products can rely on for their configuration requirements.  The lack of un-necessary copying and locking, coupled with the disconnected cache-based approach (which minimizes roundtrips out of process, off machine, and to datastores) all eliminate significant overhead from important scenarios like serving up configuration at runtime, support for efficient interaction with remote or out-of-process configuration, and rich validation at configuration time.  The common model for requesting tables, specifying queries, and making changes, regardless of underlying storage, merging, and validation allows development teams dependent on configuration to focus on their scenario rather than managing storage and validation issues.  The fact that under the covers, simple tables provide a rich architecture for faulting in the right implementations, using and even changing among different stores, and plugging in rich merge and validation logic as well as sophisticated actions, allows configuration and administration teams to meet both the performance driven requirements of runtime and the rich requirements of configuration time without disrupting dependent teams. Hopefully these initial examples have given you a deeper understanding of how to use simple tables, and a good introduction to what you can do with simple tables.  You should now be able to easily begin coding with simple tables.  The reference sections below are quite detailed, and can answer questions you have along the way.  Hopefully the samples have convinced you that simple tables are both easy to use and powerful.  The real power of course happens under the covers, with the dynamic binding process which selects the right implementation for the job at hand, binds to the right datastore, and faults in the right logic.  Continue into the other parts of this specification if you are interested in understanding how it all works under the covers. Reference: Using the Table Dispenser (a.k.a. Everything You Need to Know to Use the Table Dispenser) To obtain tables, your first get a table dispenser via GetSimpleTableDispenser.  Using the table dispenser, you can then request tables, qualified by a query and level of service, via ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable.  Before reading this reference, be sure to read the  Obtaining Simple Tables  introductory section.  // ================================================================== HRESULT GetSimpleTableDispenser DWORD i_eProduct, DWORD i_fReserved, ISimpleTableDispenser2** o_ppISTDisp Gets the simple table dispenser given a product identifier.  Note that the table dispenser is guaranteed to be thread safe. i_eProduct: The product identifier specifies the product in which the dispenser will be used.  Each team which receives an independent drop of simple tables receives its own product identifier.  The product identifier enables co-existence of side-by-side drops of simple tables on the same computer, for use by independent teams. i_fReserved: Reserved.  This parameter must be 0. o_ppISTDisp: The caller specified address of their simple table dispenser pointer (must be NULL). HRESULT errors: The caller s table dispenser pointer is guaranteed not to be changed if any error occurs. E_INVALIDARG: Unrecognized product ID, non-NULL interface pointer, or NULL pointer address. E_OUTOFMEMORY: Insufficient memory to obtain the table dispenser.  Pack up and go home. // ================================================================== ISimpleTableDispenser2:: GetTable GetProductID // ================================================================== ISimpleTableDispenser2:: HRESULT  GetTable [in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase,  [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable,  [in] LPVOID i_QueryData, [in] LPVOID i_QueryMeta, [in] DWORD i_eQueryFormat, [in] DWORD i_fServiceRequests,  [out] LPVOID* o_ppv Provides a simple table in response to a specified database + table identity, query, and requested level-of-service. i_wszDatabase, i_wszTable: The combination of a database and table uniquely identifies a table.  Both identifiers are  virtual .  A table name identifies a table having a certain logical schema independent of where its rows are actually stored.  A database name identifies a logical grouping of related table IDs. i_QueryData, i_QueryMeta: The query data and meta information.  The content of these parameters depends on the query format specified.  For eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS (the least-common-denominator query format for simple tables): The query data is an array of STQueryCell structures, defined as: typedef struct { LPVOID pData; DWORD eOperator; ULONG iCell; DWORD dbType; ULONG cbSize; } STQueryCell; iCell specifies the cell identity, which is either a column index in the requested table or one of the reserved cell identifiers which exist outside particular tables and can apply to numerous or all tables (eg: iST_CELL_COMPUTER is a cell indicating the computer name on which to look for the requested table).  Reserved cells can be identified by AND ing iCell with iST_CELL_SPECIAL. pData specifes the value of interest for the particular cell or column. eOperator specifies the relationship operator between the specified cell/column and its data (eg: eST_OP_EQUAL and eST_OP_NOTEQUAL). dbType specifies the type of the cell or column.  A subset of the OLEDB DBTYPE s are supported. cbSize specifies the size in count of bytes of the data.  cbSize can be 0 when the size of the data is easily determined either via the type or data (eg: cbSize can be 0 for fixed-length types, like DBTYPE_GUID; cbSize can be 0 for string data since the size is easily determined via wcslen; cbSize must be specified when the size cannot be easily determined without consulting schema, like DBTYPE_BYTES data).  When the size can be easily determined and is not specified, the dispenser simply fills it in. An array of query cells must be ordered with reserved cells first followed by primary key cells in order followed by other column cells.  This ordering requirement significantly reducing parsing overhead. In an array of query cells, cells with the same column index or cell identity are implicitly OR ed together, whereas cells with different identities are implicitly AND ed.  This approach satifies a large baseline of useful queries.  More complicated queries require the richness of a query language. The query meta is simply a pointer to the count of query cells supplied.  If the query data is NULL (ie: no cells specified), the query meta must also be NULL. The dispenser copies the array of query cells within the GetTable call, so the caller can change their query contents between GetTable calls. i_fServiceRequests: service requests  parameter takes level-of-service flags.  Not specifying any flags at all gives the minimum level of service with the most commonly used behavior, and also allows for the best potential performance.  Service flags specify richer behavior and/or less commonly used behavior.  Requesting increased level-of-service does not guarantee obtaining it (e.g: if the table you are requesting happens to be stored in a read-only format, requesting a write-able table won't help).  Here are the currently supported requests: fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK: Requests a service level appropriate for configuration time.  This may include routing all populates and updates through an administration process which enforces useful security, transaction, and isolation semantics.  By default, a service level appropriate for runtime is chosen.  This allows for the best potential performance, but typically means richer service is not available. fST_LOS_READWRITE: Requests a read-write table (caller receives an ISimpleTableWrite2).  By default, caller receives an ISimpleTableRead2.  The caller can still query for the ISimpleTableWrite2 interface, but UpdateStore will return E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED.  Typically, fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK is required when requesting read-write capabilities.  Do not request this in code paths which never write. fST_LOS_UNPOPULATED: Requests that the dispenser not execute the query before supplying the table (table has an empty read cache).  By default, the dispenser calls PopulateCache for the caller.  This level-of-service is useful when the caller plans to write and without reading, saving the cost of a query execution. fST_LOS_REPOPULATE: Requests a table which can be re-populated after being retrieved.  ISimpleTableAdvanced::PopulateCache may be called to re-execute the query and re-populate the table.  By default, PopulateCache returns E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED. fST_LOS_MARSHALLABLE: Requests a marshallable table. This level-of-service is only required by table marshalling implementations (while many are possible, one or two at most are required).  By default, ISimpleTableController::GetMarshallingInterface returns E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED. fST_LOS_NOLOGIC: Requests a table with no logic faulted in under-the-covers.  Rarely used but very necessary when a caller must get around embedded logic.  Unless you know what you are doing, requesting this is a programming error which can result in inconsistent or corrupted data. o_ppv: Caller specifies the address of a pointer to an ISimpleTableRead2 interface, or to an ISimpleTableWrite2 interface if they specified the fST_LOS_READWRITE flag.  The pointer must be NULL. HRESULT errors: The caller s simple table pointer is guaranteed not to be changed if any error occurs. E_ST_INVALIDTABLE: The database and/or table ID were not recognized. E_ST_INVALIDQUERY: The query specified is invalid. E_ST_QUERYNOTSUPPORTED: The query or query format is not supported for the table and/or level-of-service specified. E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED: Service request could not be satisfied for the requested table. E_ST_DETAILEDERRORS: The read cache was populated with the rows matching your query, but errors were detected on some of those rows.  Use ISimpleTableAdvanced to obtain detailed error information.  See the reference on UpdateStore for common detailed errors. E_INVALIDARG: The caller s pointer or pointer address was invalid. E_OUTOFMEMORY: Insufficient memory to obtain the table.  Pack up and go home. E_ST_INVALIDMETA: Problems were detected in the meta database on which all tables rely. E_ST_INVALIDWIRING: Problems were detected in the wiring database on which the table dispenser relies. Other errors may be returned which are table implementation specific. // ================================================================== ISimpleTableDispenser2:: HRESULT  GetProductID (   [out]       LPWSTR          o_wszProductID,     [in, out]   DWORD *         io_pcchProductID); Gets the Product ID that is associated with this dispenser. o_wszProductID:  Product ID will be stored here. Pass in null pointer if you only want to request the size of the product ID. io_pcchProductID: Contains maximum size of o_wszProductID before the call, and size of product ID after the call.

More Than You Wanted to Know about Reading Via Tables) Be sure to read the  Obtaining Simple Tables  and  Reading From Simple Tables  introductory sections before reading this reference section.   // ================================================================== ISimpleTableRead2:: GetColumnValues GetTableMeta GetColumnMetas GetRowIndexByIdentity GetRowIndexBySearch The ISimpleTableRead2 interface supports getting the column values of any row in the read cache, obtaining basic meta about the table and its columns, and finding a row by primary key identity in the read cache. Once you obtain a table from the table dispenser, you can interact with it via ISimpleTableRead2.  An ISimpleTableRead2 pointer conceptually encapsulates a read cache containing the rows which matched your query.  The read cache is in-memory and in-process.  Thus, when reading, the only roundtrip to the datastore itself occurs when executing the query.  Iterating over the resulting rows and their column values occurs entirely in the caller s process. Think of the read cache as an array of rows which met your query criteria.  These rows are indexed from 0 to count of rows - 1.  If your query resulted in a single row, that row will be at index 0 in the read cache.  Besides iterating over rows in their retrieved order, you can also look up a row by specifying its primary key identity. The column values of any row in the read cache can be obtained singly, as a specified subset, or all together.  Column values are fetched by giving the caller pointers directly into the values inside the read cache.  This alleviates the need to allocate/copy/de-allocate when fetching column values.  Obviously the caller must obey lifetime rules on these pointers and must never overwrite the values to which they point. // ================================================================== // Getting column values: ISimpleTableRead2:: HRESULT GetColumnValues ([in] ULONG i_iRow, [in] ULONG i_cColumns, [in] ULONG* i_aiColumns,  [out] ULONG* o_acbSizes, [out] LPVOID* o_apvValues); Obtain pointers to one or more requested column values on the specified row in the read cache. Pointers remain valid only until the simple table is released.  The values are owned by the simple table: no copying takes place.  Attempting to modify the value is a programming error.  While not of concern to most callers, certain advanced or control methods also invalidate pointers obtained via GetColumnValues: Query re-execution via ISimpleTableAdvanced::PopulateCache. Cache reshaping via ISimpleTableController::ShapeCache. Read cache alteration via ISimpleTableController::PrePopulateCache/PostPopulateCache. i_iRow: Specifies the index of the row in this read cache on which to fetch column values.  Row indexes range from 0 to count of rows - 1. i_cColumns: Specifies the count of column values to be retrieved.  The count can range from 1 to count of columns.  For a given table, a fixed order to the columns is guaranteed, as specified by the schema. i_aiColumns: Specifies the array of column indexes for which to retrieve values.  i_cColumns indicates the count of column indexes in this array.  The following possibilities are supported: Retrieve a single specific value.  i_cColums is 1 and i_aiColumms is a one element array containing the single column index of interest. Retrieve a specific set of values.  i_cColums is the count of values of interest and i_aiColumms is an array of the indexes for the columns of interest. Retrieve the values for column indexes 0 to n.  i_cColumns is n and i_aiColumns is NULL. Retrieve the values of all columns.  i_cColumns equals the actual count of columns and i_aiColumns is NULL. o_apvValues: Specifies an array of pointers for the requested column values.  On success, these will point to the column values requested.  For a given table, all values for a column are guaranteed to be of the type specified for that column by the schema.  The column s value can be NULL, and if so, that pointer will be NULL.  The value pointers themselves need not be set to NULL before calling.  The following possibilities are supported: When retrieving a single specific value, o_apvValues is the address of a pointer to hold the specified value. When retrieving the first n column values or all column values, o_apvValues is an array of pointers of count i_cColumns. When retrieving a specific set of values, o_apvValues must be an array of pointers whose count is the largest column index in the set + 1.  The array of pointers will be sparsely filled.  Only those at indexes requested will be pointed to column values.  This approach allows efficient subsequent lookup of each value. o_acbSizes: Optionally specifies an array of sizes of the requested column values (always in count of bytes).  Callers typically do not need to know the size because it is either fixed according to the column type or meta (eg: DBTYPE_GUID, or fST_COLUMN_FIXEDLENGTH), or easily determined by the data (eg: DBTYPE_WSTR).  NULL is specified when the caller is not interested obtaining sizes.  If the caller does request sizes, they need not initialize their size variable to 0 before calling.  The same possibilities for o_apvValues apply to o_acbSizes when specified. HRESULT errors:  On any error, the caller s value pointers and requested sizes are guaranteed to be set to NULL and 0 respectively when possible. E_ST_NOMOREROWS: Specified row index was invalid.  Either the read cache is empty or the specified row index is out of range. E_ST_NOMORECOLUMS: The specified column count or a column index was out of range. E_INVALIDARG: The address supplied by the caller for their array of value pointers is NULL. E_ST_INVALIDCALL: Getting column values attempted while populating the read cache  (not applicable for normal callers: this error can occur internally in bad table implementations). // ================================================================== // Discovering meta: ISimpleTableRead2:: HRESULT GetTableMeta [out] ULONG* o_pcBaseVersion, [out] DWORD* o_pfTable, [out] ULONG * o_pcRows, [out] ULONG * o_pcColumns HRESULT GetColumnMetas [in] ULONG i_cColumns, [in] ULONG* i_aiColumns, [out] SimpleColumnMeta* o_aColumnMetas); Provide basic meta information about a table and its columns.  All information is optionally available, so NULL may be specified for anything not of interest to the caller.  To obtain richer meta information, see the  Dynamic Schema Adaptation  section. o_pfTable: The table meta flags.  See the  Reference: The Meta Database  details about these meta flags. o_pcBaseVersion: The base version of this table.  Table columns are ordered.  The table version only changes if existing columns are re-ordered in the schema (which occurs either by re-ordering existing columns, deleting existing columns, or inserting a new column among existing columns).  The table version does not change when new columns are added after existing columns.  Column re-ordering affects callers who have compiled constants for the column indices, requiring such callers to re-compile.  However, re-ordering existing columns only occurs during the development cycle and rarely at that.  The base version is useful simply for such callers to assert that their column constants are valid. o_pcRows, o_pcColumns: The count of rows and count of columns respectively.  The count of rows refers to the number of rows currently in the read cache which resulted from the last execution of the caller s query.  Obviously if the query was not yet executed (because the fST_LOS_UNPOPULATED level-of-service was specified and the table has not been subsequently populated), or the query was executed and no matching rows were found, the row count will be 0.  The count of columns is determined from the table s schema and only changes if the schema itself is changed. i_cColumns:  Count of columns for which to fetch meta.  See the reference for the i_cColumns parameter of GetColumnValues. i_aiColumns:  Array of column indexes for which to fetch meta.  See the reference for the i_aiColumns parameter of GetColumnValues for supported possibilities. o_aColumnMetas: An array of simple column meta structures for the columns requested.  Simple column meta is defined as: typedef struct { DWORD dbType; ULONG cbSize; DWORD fMeta; } SimpleColumnMeta; dbType: The column type.  See the  Reference: The Meta Database  for details about column types. cbSize: The column size, always in count of bytes.  If the column type is a fixed-length type, or the column s meta indicates the column values will be of fixed-length (fST_COLUMN_FIXEDLENGTH), this is guaranteed to be the size of any value for this column.  If the column s meta instead indicate the column values will be of a maximum size, this size is that maximum.  The actual size of any given column value will vary up that maximum inclusively.  If none of the above is true, the size will be ~0, indicating that column values will be of variable and unlimited length.  When a column s size is not fixed, the actual size of any given column value can be optionally obtained from GetColumnValues. fMeta: Column meta flags.  See the  Reference: The Meta Database  for details about these flags. See the reference for the o_apvValues parameter of GetColumnValues for supported possibilities. HRESULT errors: On any error, the caller s column meta structures are guaranteed to be zeroed when possible. E_ST_NOMORECOLUMS: For GetColumnMetas, the specified column count or an index was out of range.  E_ST_INVALIDCALL: GetTableMeta attempted while populating the read cache  (not applicable for normal callers: this error can occur internally in bad table implementations). // ================================================================== // Locating rows by identity: ISimpleTableRead2:: HRESULT  GetRowIndexByIdentity ([in] ULONG* i_acb, [in] LPVOID* i_apv, [out] ULONG* o_piRow); Get the index of a row in the read cache by searching for its primary key identity.  Lookup by identity is rare compared to lookup by row index.  Rather than navigate by identity, callers interested in certain identities more commonly query for a single identity or set of identities when obtaining the table. i_apv: Specifies an array of pointers to primary key values.  Primary keys may be composed of multiple columns, and those columns are known via the table s meta and ordered relative to each other.  Therefore, the count of pointers in this array must be the count of columns in the primary key, the pointers must be ordered in the relative order of the primary key columns, and the types to which the pointers point must be the types of the corresponding columns.  E.g.: For a table whose meta indicates columns 0, 1, and 10 are primary key columns, and they are a guid, string, and integer, an array of 3 pointers to a guid, string, and integer in that order would be supplied. i_acb: Specifies an optional array of sizes matching the values above, almost always NULL.  If all primary key columns are either of fixed-length data-types, or their size can be easily determined from the data (eg: DBTYPE_WSTR), or their meta specifies a fixed length even though the type is variable length, the array of sizes must be NULL.  If one of the columns is truly a variable length which cannot be determined by the type, meta, or data (extremely unusual for a primary key column), the array of sizes is required.  The array of sizes must then correspond to the array of pointers, but all elements will be ignored except for the columns which truly require a caller-specified size. o_piRow:  The returned index to the row in this read cache matching the specified primary key identity.  ~0 if not found. HRESULT errors: E_ST_NOMOREROWS: Specified row identity was not found.  The row index returned will be ~0. E_INVALIDARG: Array of sizes was required but caller specified NULL, array of sizes was not required but caller specified non-NULL, array of pointers was NULL, at least one of the pointers in the array of pointers was NULL, or the pointer for the row index was NULL. E_ST_INVALIDCALL: Row navigation attempted while populating the read cache (not applicable for normal callers: this error can occur internally in bad table implementations). // ================================================================== // Locating rows by column values: ISimpleTableRead2:: HRESULT  GetRowIndexBySearch ([in] ULONG i_iStartingRow, [in] ULONG i_cColumns, ULONG* i_aiColumns,   [in] ULONG i_acbSizes, [in] LPVOID* i_apvValues, ULONG *o_piRow) Get the index of a row in the read cache by searching for particular column values. Lookup by column values is rare compared to lookup by row index.  Rather than navigate by identity, callers interested in certain identities more commonly query for a single identity or set of identities when obtaining the table. i_iStartingRow Specifies the row in the read cache where the search should start. Because it is possible that there are multiple elements that match the column values, we need to indicate how to find the next match. This can be done by changing the i_iStartingRow paramter. i_cColumns:  Count of columns for which to compare information.  See the reference for the i_cColumns parameter of GetColumnValues. i_aiColumns:  Array of column indexes for which we need to compare information.  See the reference for the i_aiColumns parameter of GetColumnValues for supported possibilities. i_acbSizes: Optionally specifies an array of sizes of the requested column values (always in count of bytes).  Callers typically do not need to know the size because it is either fixed according to the column type or meta (eg: DBTYPE_GUID, or fST_COLUMN_FIXEDLENGTH), or easily determined by the data (eg: DBTYPE_WSTR).  NULL is specified when the caller is not interested obtaining sizes.  If the caller does request sizes, they need not initialize their size variable to 0 before calling.  The same possibilities for i_apvValues apply to i_acbSizes when specified. i_apvValues: Specifies an array of pointers for the column values.  They point to the values that are used in the compare.  When comparing a single specific value, i_apvValues is the address of a pointer to hold the specified value. When comparing the first n column values or all column values, i_apvValues is an array of pointers of count i_cColumns. When comparing a specific set of values, i_apvValues must be an array of pointers whose count is the largest column index in the set + 1.  The array of pointers will be sparsely filled.  Only those at indexes requested will be pointed to column values. o_piRow:  The returned index to the row in this read cache matching the specified column values. ~0 if not found. HRESULT errors: E_ST_NOMOREROWS: No row was found that matches the column values.  The row index returned will be ~0. E_INVALIDARG: Array of sizes was required but caller specified NULL, array of sizes was not required but caller specified non-NULL, array of pointers was NULL, at least one of the pointers in the array of pointers was NULL, or the pointer for the row index was NULL. E_ST_INVALIDCALL: Row navigation attempted while populating the read cache (not applicable for normal callers: this error can occur internally in bad table implementations). Reference: Writing Via Tables  (a.k.a. More Than You Wanted to Know about Writing Via Tables) Be sure to understand the  Reference: Reading From Tables  section before reading this reference section. // ================================================================== ISimpleTableWrite2: ISimpleTableRead2:: AddRowForInsert AddRowForUpdate AddRowForDelete GetWriteColumnValues SetWriteColumnValues UpdateStore GetWriteRowIndexByIdentity GetWriteRowIndexBySearch The ISimpleTableWrite2 interface contains methods for inserting, deleting, and updating rows, methods for getting and setting column values in the write cache, a method for updating the datastore with all the  pending  changes in the write cache, and a method for finding a row by primary key identity in the write cache. Recall that the read cache of a simple table contains the rows resulting from the query executed by ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable.  The ISimpleTableRead2 interface pointer encapsulates that in-process, in-memory read cache.  Thus, when reading, the only roundtrip to the datastore itself occurs when executing the query.  Iterating over the resulting rows and their column values occurs entirely within the caller s process.  Writing via simple tables follows a similar pattern.   The ISimpleTableWrite2 interface derives from the ISimpleTableRead2 interface.  Because of this derivation, you can do everything with the write interface that you can with the read interface, and more.  Obtaining a table from the dispenser via its GetTable method either supplies an ISimpleTableRead2 interface pointer (by default) or an ISimpleTableWrite2 interface pointer (if the read-write level-of-service is requested). The ISimpleTableWrite2 interface pointer conceptually encapsulates a read and a write cache.  The write cache contains all the pending changes made by the caller until they tell the simple table to update the underlying datastore with those pending changes.  Thus, when writing, the only roundtrip to the datastore itself occurs when the caller wants to push a set of pending changes out to storage.  Each row insertion, row update, row deletion, and column change in that set of   pending  changes occurs entirely within the caller s process. The write cache consists of an ordered list of marked rows.  Each row is marked either for deletion, insertion, or update.  Rows marked for insertion or update contain various columns whose values have been changed.  A row in the write cache can also be marked to be ignored, in which case that row is entirely ignored when updating the datastore with the pending changes.  Pending changes are applied to storage in the order they were made by the caller. Having a separate cache for pending writes as opposed to making the changes in place in the   cache has important advantages.  Accessing column values via simple tables occurs by pointer directly into the cache.  Having a separate write cache guarantees that the caller s pointers into the read cache will be valid until they either re-populate or release the table.  If changes were made directly into the read cache, pointers to any column values might become invalid with every single change, and the invalidation scenarios would be implementation specific.  Also, having a read and write cache allows comparison between original and changed values.  While not of interest to most callers, this capability is critical to some. // ================================================================== // Adding a row for insertion, update, or deletion: ISimpleTableWrite2:: HRESULT  AddRowForInsert ([out] ULONG* o_piWriteRow); HRESULT  AddRowForUpdate ([in] ULONG i_iReadRow, [out] ULONG* o_piWriteRow); HRESULT  AddRowForDelete ([in] ULONG i_iReadRow); Add a row to the write cache marked for insertion, update, or deletion. AddRowForInsert adds a new row to the write cache marked for insertion.  Meta specified defaults for column values are applied.  The index in the write cache of the new row is returned.  AddRowForUpdate copies a row from the read cache, given its index, into the write cache, and marks it for update.  The index in the write cache of the copied row is returned.  AddRowForDelete copies a row from the read cache, given its index, into the write cache, and marks it for deletion. On a row added for insertion, values for all columns which do not have defaults must be specified, primary key columns included.  On a row added for update, since the row was copied from the read cache, all columns already have values.  On rows added for update, the primary key columns may not be changed.   Note that when inserting rows, having data-driven defaults instead of schema-driven defaults might be desired.  This can easily be accomplished assuming that a row containing those defaults can be queried for.  Given that, the caller can simply transfer the defaults from the queried row to the new row.  This operation can be encapsulated as logic specific to the applicable set of tables. i_iReadRow: The index of the row in the read cache to be added to the write cache for update or deletion. o_piWriteRow: The index of the row added to the write cache for insertion or update. HRESULT errors: E_ST_NOMOREROWS: The read cache index specified by the caller is invalid.  No changes are made to the write cache. E_OUTOFMEMORY: Insufficient memory to add the row to the write cache.  Pack up and go home. // ================================================================== // Setting and getting column values: ISimpleTableWrite2:: HRESULT GetWriteColumnValues [in] ULONG i_iRow,  [in] ULONG i_cColumns, [in] ULONG* i_aiColumns,  [out] DWORD* o_afStatus,  [out] ULONG* o_acbSizes, [out] LPVOID* o_apvValues); HRESULT SetWriteColumnValues [in] ULONG i_iRow,  [in] ULONG i_cColumns, [in] ULONG* i_aiColumns,  [in] ULONG* i_acbSizes, [in] LPVOID* i_apvValues Get and set one or more requested column values on the specified row in the write cache. Value pointers obtained from GetWriteColumnValues are invalidated by any subsequent ISimpleTableWrite2 method call or by releasing the simple table.  The values are owned by the simple table: no copying takes place.  Attempting to modify a value is a programming error.  While not of concern to most callers, certain advanced or control methods also invalidate pointers obtained via GetWriteColumnValues: Cache reshaping via ISimpleTableController::ShapeCache. Read cache alteration via ISimpleTableController::PrePopulateCache/PostPopulateCache. Discarding the write cache via ISimpleTableController::DiscardPendingWrites. i_iRow: Specifies the index of the row in the write cache on which to fetch column values.  Row indexes range from 0 to count of rows - 1. i_cColumns: See the reference for the i_cColumns parameter of GetColumnValues. i_aiColumns: See the reference for the i_aiColumns parameter of GetColumnValues. o_apvValues: See the reference for the o_apvValues parameter of GetColumnValues. o_acbSizes: Optional.  See the reference for the o_acbSizes parameter of GetColumnValues. o_afStatus: Optional array of column status flags.  The caller need not initialize their status variables to 0 before calling.  Be sure to use bit AND ing (not equality) to check for flags.  The exposed column status flags are: fST_COLUMNSTATUS_CHANGED: The column value has been changed by the caller.  The flag will not be set if the column value has not yet changed.  Schema-specified defaults applied to column values on AddRowForInsert do not show up as changes.  Note that all column values (unless the meta specifies otherwise) are guaranteed to be written to the datastore on row insertions or updates. The same possibilities for o_apvValues and o_cbSizes apply to o_afStatus  when specified. i_apvValues:  Array of pointers to values to be set on the specified row in the write cache.  These values are copied by SetWriteColumnValues.  The same possibilities for o_apvValues are supported. i_apvValues:  Array of sizes corresponding to the values specified in i_apvValues.  The same possibilities for o_acbSizes are supported.  When the size of a value can be determined by the column type, meta, or value itself, the size specified in this array is guaranteed to be ignored (i.e. 0 can be supplied in most cases).  If this is the case for all column values specified, this array can be NULL. HRESULT errors: Note that on any error from GetWriteColumnValues specifically, the caller s value pointer, requested status and size are guaranteed to be set to NULL and 0 respectively when possible. E_ST_NOMOREROWS: The row index specified is out of range.  No change occurs. E_ST_NOMORECOLUMNS: The column index specified is out of range.  No change occurs. E_ST_SIZENEEDED: The caller did not specify the size of a column value passed to SetWriteColumnValues whose size cannot be determined by the column type, meta, or value itself. E_ST_SIZEEXCEEDED: The column value specified in the call to SetWriteColumnValues was determined to be greater in size than the maximum or fixed size specified by meta.  No change occurs. E_ST_VALUEINVALID: The value specified by the caller for a column is invalid according the meta. E_ST_PKNOTCHANGEABLE: The column specified in the call to SetWriteColumnValues while adding a row for update was a primary key which cannot be changed during update.  No change occurs. E_INVALIDARG: : The address supplied by the caller for their array of value pointers is NULL. E_OUTOFMEMORY: Insufficient memory to set column values.  Pack up and go home. // ================================================================== // Updating the store: ISimpleTableWrite2:: HRESULT UpdateStore Apply all pending changes in the write cache to the datastore.   The row updates, insertions, and deletions made by the caller are guaranteed to be applied in the order specified by the caller.  The write cache is cleared of pending changes, unless E_ST_DETAILEDERRORS is returned, in which case all pending changes remain.  If detailed errors occur, the caller may investigate those errors and clear the write cache of pending changes via ISimpleTableAdvanced. UpdateStore is guaranteed to iterate over all pending row changes even when detailed errors (i.e.: errors specific to a row or column, which are typically failed validations) occur.  This allows the caller to see all the errors found while attempting to process their pending changes, as opposed to the first problem only.  This does not mean that in a mix of failed and successful changes, some of the changes are applied.  By convention, when any detailed errors occur, none of the pending changes are written to the datastore.  This convention does not mean that the datastore itself is fully transactional.  It simply means that the set of pending changes will be applied together, as a unit, if and only if no detailed errors were detected.  If the underlying datastore is not itself transactional, unavoidable failures can occur when actually persisting the changes. More sophisticated validation requires evaluating the changes to a row as a whole and even validating those changes against other tables.  These validations will occur during UpdateStore. When inserting or updating a row in the datastore, all column values are guaranteed to be written (unless their meta specifies otherwise). HRESULT errors: E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED: The caller tried UpdateStore on a table instance but did not request the fST_LOS_READWRITE level-of-service when they obtained the table. E_ST_DETAILEDERRORS: While updating the store with the pending changes in the write cache, errors occurred specific to one or more of the row changes.  Use ISimpleTableAdvanced to obtain detailed error information.  Common detailed errors include: E_ST_VALUENEEDED: On a row marked for insertion, the caller was required to specify a value for a particular column (because a default value was not specified in the meta), but failed to do so.  The specific column or columns will be indicated as part of the detailed error. E_ST_VALUEINVALID: The value specified by the caller for a column is invalid according to validation rules.  The specific column or columns will be indicated as part of the detailed error. E_ST_ROWALREADYEXISTS: Inserting a row was attempted and that row already exists.  E_ST_ROWDOESNOTEXIST: Updating a row was attempted and that row does not exist. E_ST_ROWALREADYUPDATED: Updating a row was attempted but that row was already updated between the time the caller read the row and applied their changes.  By default, overlapping updates are allowed.  (Preventing overlapping updates is possible, but currently no need exists.  The infrastructure will not be plumbed to support this until a consumer drives it based on a concrete need.) E_ST_FKDOESNOTEXIST: An inserted row includes a foreign key to another table whose corresponding primary key does not exist but must exist according to meta. E_ST_INVALIDCALL: Call attempted while populating the read cache (not applicable for normal callers: this error can occur internally in bad table implementations). Other errors may be returned which are table implementation specific. // ================================================================== // Locating rows by identity: ISimpleTableWrite2:: HRESULT GetWriteRowIndexByIdentity ([in] ULONG* i_acbSizes, [in] LPVOID* i_apvValues, [out] ULONG* o_piRow); Get the index of a row in the write cache by searching for its primary key identity.  See the reference for GetRowIndexByIdentity.  The two methods are semantically identical except that one is for the read cache and one is for the write cache, and that E_ST_INVALIDCALL does not apply to GetWriteRowIndexByIdentity. // ================================================================== // Locating rows in write cache by column values: ISimpleTableRead2:: HRESULT  GetWriteRowIndexBySearch ([in] ULONG i_iStartingRow, [in] ULONG i_cColumns, ULONG* i_aiColumns,   [in] ULONG i_acbSizes, [in] LPVOID* i_apvValues, ULONG *o_piRow) Get the index of a row in the write cache by searching for column values.  See the reference for GetRowIndexBySearch.  The two methods are semantically identical except that one is for the read cache and one is for the write cache, and that E_ST_INVALIDCALL does not apply to GetWriteRowIndexBySearch. Reference: Advanced Table Usage  (a.k.a. Stuff Most Callers Who Work With Simple Tables Will Never Need) Use of certain simple table features are historically rare but very necessary for a small set of sophisticated callers.  This reference section assumes a working knowledge of previous sections. // ================================================================== ISimpleTableAdvanced:: PopulateCache GetDetailedErrorCount GetDetailedError The ISimpleTableAdvanced interface provides a method for re-executing the query on an existing table instance, reloading the read cache with the new results, and also provides methods for obtaining detailed errors.  Logic implementers aside, the configuration API is currently the only caller requiring these capabilities. Before detailing the methods, let s discuss concurrency semantics.  Making the same request to the table dispenser twice effectively yields two table instances, each with its own read cache and possibly its own write cache.  The table instances are independent and the results in each read cache will differ if the data in underlying storage changed between calls. Sophisticated callers may want to share one read cache among multiple threads.  First the caller must obtain the table instance via the table dispenser which executes their query and populates the read cache with the resulting rows.  The caller can then give out references to this table instance to multiple threads.  These threads can then read the results safely.  On a particular thread the caller can either make changes via the table object or listen on applicable notifications.  When the caller pushes accumulated changes to storage or receives notification, they can request another table instance from the table dispenser to obtain the latest results from those changes.  The caller can then release their reference to the old copy and notify the other threads that a new copy is available.  This approach allows threads using the old copy to release their references independently and when the last thread does so the old copy will be automatically cleaned up.  Callers must of course obey the lifetime rules on pointers they obtain into the read and write cache as outlined in the references for GetColumnValues and GetWriteColumnValues. // ================================================================== // Re-populating the read cache ISimpleTableAdvanced:: HRESULT PopulateCache When the caller obtains a table instance from the table dispenser, the read cache is typically already populated with the results from their query.  PopulateCache discards the existing results (if any) from the read cache, re-executes the query, and populates the read cache with the resulting rows. HRESULT errors: E_ST_LOSNOTSUPPORTED: The caller tried PopulateCache on a table instance but did not request the fST_LOS_REPOPULATE level-of-service when they obtained the table. E_ST_DETAILEDERRORS: Errors occurred during population which are available via detailed errors.  See the reference on UpdateStore for common detailed errors. // ================================================================== // Obtaining detailed errors ISimpleTableAdvanced:: HRESULT GetDetailedErrorCount ([out] ULONG* o_pcErrs); HRESULT GetDetailedError ([in] ULONG i_iErr, [out] STErr* o_pSTErr); Obtain the count of detailed errors and the detailed errors themselves.  Detailed errors can occur on ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable, ISimpleTableWrite2::UpdateStore, and ISimpleTableAdvanced::PopulateCache.  The detailed errors apply to whichever of these calls was made last. o_pcErrs: The count of detailed errors.  0 when no detailed errors were encountered. i_iErr: The index of the detailed error to obtain.  Detailed error indexes range from 0 to count of errors - 1. o_pSTErr: The detailed error information requested.  The fields need not be initialized by the caller.  A detailed error structure is defined as: typedef struct { ULONG iRow; HRESULT ULONG iColumn; } STErr; iRow: The row index to which the detailed error applies.  iST_ERROR_ALLROWS means the error applies to all rows.  If the detailed errors resulted from UpdateStore, this is an index into the write cache, and otherwise this is an index into the read cache. iColumn: The column index to which the detailed error applies.  iST_ERROR_ALLCOLUMNS means the error applies to all columns on the denoted row. hr: The error code for the detailed error, expressed as an HRESULT. HRESULT errors:  On error, the caller s detailed error structure will be zeroed when possible. E_INVALIDARG: o_pcErrs or o_pSTErr was NULL. E_ST_NOMOREERRRORS: i_iErr was out of range.

All You Need To Know About All You Can Know) Be sure to read the  Dynamic Schema Adaptation  introductory sections before reading this reference section.   // ================================================================== METADATABASE: DATABASEMETA TABLEMETA COLUMNMETA TAGMETA RELATIONMETA QUERYMETA INDEXMETA The meta database is a collection of tables regarding meta.  The databases known to the catalog, their tables, the columns in those tables are all described (as well as the legal enumerations or flags for enumeration and flag columns).  The relationships between the tables, the queries supported by each table, and the indexes available on each table are also described. Recall that a database, in simple table terms, is a logical collection of tables.  Those tables need not all come from one physical datastore or location, and typically they don t.  In simple table terms, databases are virtual collections of tables, datastores are places where table information is persisted.  Simple tables encapsulate the datastore details from callers. The meta database is a collection of meta information tables which are obtained via the table dispenser and readable as simple tables.  The table implementation serving up meta database tables is read-only and extremely efficient.  Writing to the meta database occurs via an out-of-band compilation from a XML-based source format.  Many simple table consumers can and should use the meta database to insure they dynamically adapt to schema changes.   The meta database can answer all sorts of interesting questions, like: What are the databases known to the catalog? What are the tables in a database? What are the columns in a table? What is the type, size, and attributes of a column? What are the relationships between tables? This reference succinctly describes each meta table and its columns.  The meta tables themselves are fully self-described via the meta database. // ================================================================== DATABASEMETA: InternalName DBTYPE_WSTR PRIMARYKEY PublicName DBTYPE_WSTR BaseVersion DBTYPE_UI4 ExtendedVersion DBTYPE_UI4 CountOfTables DBTYPE_UI4 DATABASEMETA describes each database known to the catalog. InternalName: The internal name of the database.  Internal database constants are generated from this. The table dispenser recognizes databases by their internal names. PublicName: The public name of the database.  Used by the administration api and public media. BaseVersion: The base version of this database.   Each time tables are removed, the base version increments.  The base version must not change when tables are added.  Therefore, the base version guarantees a well-known minimum subset of tables. ExtendedVersion: The extended version of this database.   The extended version increments whenever tables are added or removed. CountOfTables: The count of tables in this database (derived from the TABLEMETA table). // ================================================================== TABLEMETA: Database DBTYPE_WSTR PRIMARYKEY | FOREIGNKEY InternalName DBTYPE_WSTR PRIMARKKEY PublicName DBTYPE_WSTR PublicRowName DBTYPE_WSTR BaseVersion DBTYPE_UI4 ExtendedVersion DBTYPE_UI4 NameColumn DBTYPE_UI4 NavColumn DBTYPE_UI4 CountOfColumns DBTYPE_UI4 MetaFlags DBTYPE_UI4 SchemaGeneratorFlags DBTYPE_UI4 TABLEMETA describes each table known to the catalog. Database: The internal name of the one database to which this table belongs. InternalName: The internal name of the table, from which internal table and column constants are built.  The table dispenser recognizes tables by their internal names. PublicName: The public name of the table.  Used by the administration api and public media. PublicRowName: The public name of the rows in the table. BaseVersion: The base version of this table. Each time existing columns are re-ordered (either by re-ordering, inserting new columns, deleting existing columns) or the meta any existing columns is fundamentally changed, the base version increments.  The version must not change when new columns are added.  Therefore, a version guarantees a well-known subset of columns having well-known meta. ExtendedVersion: The extended version of this table: increments whenever table or column meta changes. NameColumn: The column in the table whose value is the public name for the row.   The administrative api displays the names of the rows from this column.  The name column must be of type DBTYPE_WSTR. NavColumn: The column in the table used by the administrative api for hierarchical navigation.   This column must be one of the a primary key columns. CountOfColumns: The count of columns in this table (derived from the COLUMNMETA table). MetaFlags: The meta flags for the table.   When a flag represents a boolean choice, the flag specifies the less common choice, and the absence of the flag specifies the common choice. fTABLEMETA_INTERNAL: The table is not publically exposed by the administrative api. fTABLEMETA_NOLISTENING: The notification system will never listen for changes on this table. fTABLEMETA_RELATIONINTEGRITY: The integrity logic table is needed either to relational integrity.  The integrity table uses the RELATIONSMETA table for enforcing relational integrity. fTABLEMETA_ROWINTEGRITY: The integrity logic table will be used to enforce row integrity during UpdateStore (inserting a row fails if the row already exists; updating a row fails if the row does not exist). fTABLEMETA_UNKNOWNSIZES: The table has at least one column where the sizes of its values cannot be determined from the type, meta, or data directly (meaning the size must be requested when getting the column values and must be specified when setting them).  Derived from column meta. fTABLEMETA_HASDIRECTIVE: The table has a column for merge directives: derived from column meta. fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICINSERT: The administrative api will block row insertions into this table.  Never set for internal tables. fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICUPDATE: The administrative api will block row updates into this table.  Never set for internal tables. fTABLEMETA_NOPUBLICDELETE: The administrative api will block row deletes into this table.  Never set for internal tables. fTABLEMETA_HIDDEN: The table is hidden by the administrative api. This can be used to exclude tables from WMI. SchemaGeneratorFlags:The schema generator flags for the table. fTABLEGENERATOR_XMLSCHEMA: Generate XML schema for the table. fTABLEGENERATOR_CLBSCHEMA: Generate CLB schema for the table. // ================================================================== COLUMNMETA: Table DBTYPE_WSTR PRIMARYKEY | FOREIGNKEY Index DBTYPE_UI4 PRIMARYKEY InternalName DBTYPE_WSTR PublicName  DBTYPE_WSTR DBTYPE_UI4 DBTYPE_UI4 MetaFlags DBTYPE_UI4 DefaultValue DBTYPE_BYTES FlagsMask DBTYPE_UI4 StartingNumber DBTYPE_UI4 EndingNumber DBTYPE_UI4 CharacterSet DBTYPE_WSTR COLUMNMETA describes the columns of each table known to the catalog.

How To Describe And Compile Your Schema) Assuming you read the pre-requisite section  Reference: The Meta Database , you are probably hoping that you need not specify all of that meta each time you need a new table or a new column on an existing table.  Fear not, for reasonable defaults exist for most meta.  New meta is expressed via an XML-based source format.  This source format is very tolerant, allowing expression of your meta requirements as minimally as possible.  Astute readers probably also noted that several dependencies and redundancies exist across the meta database.  A meta compiler generates the meta database from the XML-based source format.  The compiler takes care synchronizing those dependencies and redundancies. The meta source begins with the following header: <?xml version=1.0?> <MetaData xmlns= x-schema:catmeta.xms where catmeta.xms is the XML schema for the meta source. Recall that databases contain tables, tables contain columns, and enum and flag columns contain tags.  Tables also contain queries and indexes.  Relations span tables.  The containment hierarchy for the meta source is: <DatabaseMeta  <TableMeta  <ColumnMeta  <TagMeta  </ColumnMeta> <QueryMeta  <IndexMeta  </TableMeta> </DatabaseMeta> <RelationMeta  The minimal containment necessary to describe a new table is that the table must belong to a database and the columns in the table must be specified.  The meta compiler minimally requires the internal names of the database, table, and columns, the types of the columns, and at least one column denoted as a primary key.  Reasonable defaults for all other meta can be derived from this information.  For example: <DatabaseMeta InternalName= URTConfig <TableMeta InternalName= Applications <ColumnMeta InternalName= Type= DBTYPE_WSTR  MetaFlags= PRIMARYKEY <ColumnMeta InternalName= Description Type= DBTYPE_WSTR <ColumnMeta InternalName= Type= DBTYPE_UI4 </TableMeta> </DatabaseMeta> The attributes supported on each type of meta are outlined below.  See the  Reference: The Meta Database  section for descriptions.  Some attributes and flags are never specified since the meta compiler can always correctly derive them.  Those attributes and flags appear in comments. <DatabaseMeta  InternalName string PublicName string BaseVersion ExtendedVersion <!--CountOfTables derived from TableMeta --> <TableMeta  InternalName string PublicName string PublicRowName string BaseVersion ExtendedVersion MetaFlags INTERNAL NOLISTENING RELATIONINTEGRITY ROWINTEGRITY      NOPUBLICINSERT NOPUBLICUPDATE NOPUBLICDELETE SchemaGeneratorFlags XMLSCHEMA CLBSCHEMA <!-- Database  derived from containing element --> <!-- NameColumn derived from ColumnMeta --> <!-- NavColumn derived from ColumnMeta --> <!--CountOfColumns  derived from ColumnMeta --> <!--HASUNKNOWNSIZES and HASDIRECTIVES derived from ColumnMeta --> <ColumnMeta  InternalName string PublicName string UI4 GUID WSTR BYTES DBTIMESTAMP MetaFlags PRIMARYKEY FOREIGNKEY NAMECOLUMN NAVCOLUMN DIRECTIVE      BOOL FLAG ENUM      WRITENEVER WRITEONCHANGE WRITEONINSERT      NOTPUBLIC NOTDOCD      PUBLICREADONLY PUBLICWRITEONLY      INSERTDEFAULT INSERTGENERATE INSERTUNIQUE INSERTPARENT      NOTNULLABLE FIXEDLENGTH HASNUMERICRANGE      HASLEGALCHARS HASILLEGALCHARS DefaultValue StartingNumber EndingNumber CharacterSet string <!-- Table derived from containing element --> <!-- Index derived from position --> <!-- FlagMask derived from TagMeta --> <TagMeta  InternalName string PublicName string Value 0...n <!-- Table derived from containing element --> <!-- Index derived from containing element --> <QueryMeta  InternalName string PublicName string CellName string Operator EQUAL NOTEQUAL MetaFlags ALL ANY <!-- Table derived from containing element --> <!-- Order derived from position --> <IndexMeta  InternalName string PublicName string Column string MetaFlags NONUNIQUE SORTED INSENSITIVE <!-- Table derived from containing element --> <RelationMeta  PrimaryTable string PrimaryColumns 0..n 0..n  ForeignTable string ForeignColumns 0..n 0..n  MetaFlags CASCASEDELETE PRIMARYREQUIRED catutil.exe can validate the meta source.  Supported validation usages include: CATUTIL catmeta.xml CATUTIL /VALIDATE catmeta.xml The former verifies catmeta.xml is well formed XML.  The latter validates catmeta.xml against an available DTD or XML schema.  Both the verification and validation work with any XML file. catutil.exe also compiles the meta source.  The typical meta compilation usage is: CATUTIL /COMPILE /meta=catmeta.xml /wire=catwire.xml /header=catmeta.h /schema=catalog.xms /dll=catalog.dll /COMPILE:  Indicates this is a compile. /meta:  The meta source XML. /wire:  The wiring source XML (see  Part III: Stores And Logic /header:  The name for the generated header file. /schema:  The name for the generated XML schema file. /dll:  The name of the catalog dll into which the meta and wiring databases will be compiled. If the files catmeta.xml, catwire.xml, and catalog.dll are present in the same directory as catutil.exe, and catmeta.h and catalog.xms are acceptable filenames, the compilation syntax may be shortened to: CATUTIL /COMPILE The generated header creates C constant names for all databases, tables, columns, tags and other meta processed.  Constant names are generated as follows: Database constant names are generated by concatenating  wszDATABASE_  with the database internal name.  Table constant names are generated by concatenating  wszTABLE_  with the table internal name. Column constant names are generated by concatenating  , the internal name of the table in which the column exists,  , and the column internal name. Column value flag constant names are generated by concatenating  , the column internal name,  , and the tag internal name of the flag.  Column value enum constant names are generated by concatenating  , the column internal name,  , and the tag internal name of the enumeration.

Plug-ins, Implementation Dispensers, and Table Implementations (a.k.a. This is What Makes Simple Tables So Cool) Interceptors Defining a new interceptor To create a new interceptor, follow the following steps: Edit src\catinproc\catmeta_core.xml and find the collection SERVERWIRINGMETA Add a new enum value to the interceptor property, i.e. <Enum InternalName= MyDummyInterceptor  Value= Go to your meta-file (i.e. URTMeta.xml), find the table you want to use the new interceptor, and add the following line: <ServerWiring Interceptor= MyDummyInterceptor  DLLName= MyDLL Implement the new interceptor in MyDLL.dll. Rebuild the catalog The above assumes that the interceptor lives in its own DLL. In case the interceptor lives in catalog.dll, we have to do the following after step 4: In catinproc.cpp, find DllGetSimpleObjectByID and add a new case statement for the new interceptor. Implement the GetMyDummyInterceptro function in catinproc.cpp Rebuild the catalog. How does ServerWiring work It is possible to define multiple interceptors for a single table. To find out which interceptors are invoked for a table, we have to distinguish between two different interceptor types: Store interceptors Store interceptors abstract a configuration store (i.e. abstract where the data is stored). A store interceptor is identified by metaflag  First  in the SERVERWIRING element. Logic interceptors Logic interceptors to additional validation of data after it is read from the configuration store and before it is written to the configuration store.. A logic interceptor is identified by metaflag   in the SERVERWIRING element To figure out which store interceptor to use the following logic is used: Find the first store interceptor, and call Intercept on it. If this call succeeds, use this interceptor, and ignore all other interceptors. If this call fails with E_OMITDISPENSER, we try the next store interceptor. If no other interceptor is found an error is returned After we have found a valid store interceptor, all logic interceptors are added in the order they are defined. Each logic interceptor will be called in succession during PopulateCache and OnUpdateStore. For instance, suppose I have the following serverwiring for a table: <SERVERWIRING Interceptor= MergeInterceptor  MetaFlags= First <SERVERWIRING Interceptor= XMLInterceptor  MetaFlags= First <SERVERWIRING ReadPlugin= ReadPlugin1  MetaFlags= <SERVERWIRING ReadPlugin= ReadPlugin2  MetaFlags= The order in which things are tried is: Try the merge interceptor. If that succeeds use that as store interceptor. If that fails with E_OMITDISPENSER, try the next dispensor. Any other error code is a hard error. Try the XML interceptor. If that succeeds use that as store interceptor. Add Readplugin1 Add Readplugin2 As you can see, the readplugins are always added, i.e. they are independent of the underlying configuration store (store interceptor). Read/Write Plug-ins When you want additional validation of data beyond that what is available via the underlying interceptors, Plug-ins can be used to verify that data read or data written is valid according to certain constraints. For instance, suppose that I want to validate that a certain string is a social security number, and the format of the string should be XXX-XX-XXXX. The catalog itself does not have support for this, however a plugin can be used to verify that the string is of that particular format. Currently, two  types of plugins are supported: Read-plugins These plugins verify that data that is read is valid. For instance, when the XML Interceptor is used, a read plugin validates that the data that is specified in the XML is valid according to the constraint defined by the plugin. Read-plugins are called during PopulateCache after the interceptor has populated the cache, and the plugin is called for each row in the fastcache. When the validation fails for an individual row, PopulateCache fails, and the client gets an error. Write plugins These plugins verify that data is valid before it is written to a configuration store. For instance, when the XML Interceptor is used, the write plugin validates that the data is in the correct format (according to the constraints defined by the plugin), and only writes the information to the XML file when it is in the correct format. Write plugins are called during UpdateStore for each row in the write cache, just before the data is returned from the fastcache to an XML Interceptor (i.e. before an interceptor has a change to write the data to disk). When one of the rows in invalid, an error is returned and none of the data is written to disk. How to create Read/Write Plugins To create plugins, the following steps need to be followed: Edit src/inc/catmeta_core.xml, and find the SERVERWIRINGMETA collection Add a new enum value to either the ReadPlugin or WritePlugin property (or both in case you want a plugin to be executed for both reading and writing). Note that you cannot use the same enum name for a read and write plugin, because catutil will fail if this is the case. Add a new serverwiring element to your schema that has a ReadPlugin (or WritePlugin) attribute. If you have a serverwiring element with just ReadPlugin/WritePlugin, but no interceptor, you want to set the MetaFlags attribute to   to indicate that this ServerWiring element indicates a logical interceptor. Create a class that implements the ISimplePlugin interface. Add code to catinproc.cpp that creates this new class in case the class lives in catalog.dll, or create a new DLL that implements this class. In case of a new dll, you also have to implement the GetObjectByID function. Rebuild the catalog ISimplePlugin Interface interface ISimplePlugin : IUnknown HRESULT OnInsert([in] ISimpleTableDispenser2* i_pDisp2, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable,   [in] DWORD i_fLOS, [in] ULONG iRow, [in] ISimpleTableWrite2* i_pISTW2); HRESULT OnUpdate([in] ISimpleTableDispenser2* i_pDisp2, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable,      [in] DWORD i_fLOS, [in] ULONG iRow, [in] ISimpleTableWrite2* i_pISTW2); HRESULT OnDelete([in] ISimpleTableDispenser2* i_pDisp2, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszDatabase, [in] LPCWSTR i_wszTable,     [in] DWORD i_fLOS, [in] ULONG iRow, [in] ISimpleTableWrite2* i_pISTW2); When a row is added to the write cached for insert, OnInsert is called, when a row is added to the write cache for update, OnUpdate is called, and OnDelete is called when a row is added to the write cache and should be deleted. OnInsert is the only method called for a read-plugin. When implementing a plugin, keep in mind that you are always working on rows in the write cache, even during read. This is because the plugin is invoked before the fastcache copies the rows from the write cache to the read cache. <todo/>Note the set of interfaces all table objects must implement and then note plug-in support <todo>Document LogDetailedErrors on the table dispenser</todo> <todo>Doc reserved cells and hint behavior (not required for PK or single column queries)</todo> Need to doc valid call sequences (done for reading and writing usage above) t forget to doc the internal implementation interfaces!

For unpopulated tables, must work the same as 0 results from query. Dispenser guarantees populatecache will be called before supplying to caller.  Subsequent calls must populate when fST_LOS_UNPOPULATED was specified. By default, when calling CompleteAddRow, column values which did not have a default should result in detailed errors Do not UpdateStore when logic table detailed errors are found.  DT should support atomic units of work, but not required. Ease of writing a new data table: 3 methods. Error handling policy: continue to fail after first error or continue processing for maximum error feedback? Note the impact of side-by-side support on table implementations. Obviously some of the errors returned by the table dispenser come from the implementation dispenser: doc em! PLUGINS: These require either plumbing the interfaces into data/logic tables or a default logic table which plumbs them. Why not do the same thing for data tables?

HRESULT policy: must comply to spec. Doc all HRESULTs here Call sequence policy: must comply to spec. The Wiring Configuration, Cookdown, and Database (a.k.a. !!!) Simplify existing wiring database if possible Basic wiring should include the data table and at most one or two logic tables. We should drop the extended wiring since this can instead be supported in the implementation dispenser. Implementation dispensers should probably have a combined interface instead of one for logic and one for data tables. The notion of client tables should be probably be removed from the basic wiring.  However, client-side logic tables still need faulted in on a per-table basis.   Client data tables should be faulted in based on particular query cells being present in the query or particular flags being present in the level-of-service request.  So the client table for the catalog server would be faulted in when the query included a computer name cell or when the configtime level-of-service was requested. Issue: when writes are restricted to within the administrative process, we deny the read-write level of service outside the administrative process except for the client table.  How does this get generically specified and implemented? Note the impact of side-by-side support on the wiring database. The advantage of specifying a data table default for a database id is that new tables can be added without updating the wiring. Need a table wiring flag which blocks tables being requested from the client Tables must specify whether writes can occur outside the admin process / whether config-time isolation need not go through the admin process did+tid: datastore handler; update handler; row change handler. Add support for lookup overrides based on query / LOS flags. Add LogDetailedErrors support. Advanced service requests: fST_LOS_CLIENTSIDE: Internally supplied by the table dispenser to inform the implementation dispenser that the request is being made on the client.  Not valid for callers to specify. fST_LOS_DISABLERELATIONALINTEGRITY: Don t cascade delete, don t require primary. fST_LOS_UPDATEREADCACHEONUPDATE???

Describe notification logic table and events... Side-by-Side Usage How several teams can pickup different drops Appendices Appendix A: Basic Database Vocabulary (a.k.a. People Solved These Problems over a Decade Ago?) For those unfamilar with database concepts, think of a database as a collection of tables, and a table as a two-dimensional grid of rows and columns where all rows in a given table have the same columns.  Note that rows may be inserted, deleted, or updated.  Column values may be changed.  In object-oriented terms, a table is a collection of objects, a row is an individual object, and columns are the properties on the object.  So I might have an applications table, where each row describes one application, and columns describe information like the name and description of the application, whether to run its components in the caller's process or in an isolated process, and so forth.  A schema describes the "shape" of a table, meaning the expected columns, their types, sizes, ordering, names, and so forth.  DTD, for example, is a "schema" for XML which describes the valid structure of an XML "document".   Database implementations come in 3 basic flavors: flat, hierarchical, and relational, each more powerful than the previous.  INI files are flat databases, the Windows registry is a hierarchical database, and the COM+ regdb and SQL Server are a relational databases.  Relationships express how the various tables in a database relate to one another.  In a hierarchical database, tables are actually stored using a fixed hierarchy of relationships: working outside that fixed hierarchy is difficult and complex.  In a relational database, tables are related to each other.  One-to-one relationships express the fact that one row in a table is related to one row in another table.  One-to-many relationships express that one row in a table is related to many rows in another table.  Many-to-many relationships mean one-to-many relationships exist both ways.  These relationships allow for many different relationship hierarchies and graphs.  A hierarchical view can easily be projected atop a relational database.   So I might have a table of applications, a table of components, and a table of interfaces.  Hierarchically I might say applications contain components which contain interfaces.  While other relationships exist outside this hierarchy, querying for them can be difficult if not impossible.  Relationally I might say there is a one-to-many relationship between applications and components, and a many-to-many relationship between components and interfaces.  So far I have just defined 3 tables and 2 relationships.  With that information I can easily dynamically create the abovementioned hierarchical relationship.  I can query for all applications, then for all components in an application, and then for all interfaces of a component.  But I can also query for all interfaces in an application, for all applications whose components use a particular interface, for all components period, and so forth. A primary key typically identifies rows in a particular table.  A primary key may consist of multiple columns, and is most typically unique.  When unique, each row in a table is uniquely identified by its primary key.  A foreign key is simply your primary key in someone else's table.  So a components table might use the clsids column as the primary key, and a classmethods table might use the clsid, iid, and method index columns as the primary key, where the clsid and iid are actually foreign keys from the components and interfaces tables respectively.  Referential integrity refers to maintaining consistency among related tables, typically by enforcing one or more rules.  For example, when a row is deleted in one table, and its primary key appears as foreign keys in other tables, you might want to automatically delete none, some, or all rows in those other tables.  So if I delete application A from my applications table, and the application id is a foreign key in my components table, and a one-to-many relationship exists between the applications and components table, that delete could automatically delete components X, Y, and Z from my components table, since they reside in application A. An index can be built on any column in a database, and is used to accelerate searches on that particular column.  Primary keys are great candidates for indexing, and might be automatically indexed.  So in my components table, the clsid is the primary key, and I want searches by clsid to be fast, so naturally I want to index that column.  However, my progid column is not part of the primary key, but because progid lookups are common, I also want to index that column.  Indexes increase disk footprint, can increase working set, and can slow writes.  The progid and clsid sections of the registry are a great example of grafting indexing atop a hierarchical store which does not support them.  This requires keeping the same information in two separate places, and exposing that duplication to users, and requiring them to handle its maintenance.  This approach stores the same information in multiple places, and results in non-normalized data.  A relational database supports this internally.  So from the user perspective, good relational databases appear to be normalized: that is, no data is stored in more than one place. Selected subsets of rows in a given table can be retrieved via queries.  Queries select rows based on a criteria which may include identity (eg: primary key values), relationships (eg: foreign key values), and other values (eg: other columns in the table).  Very powerful general-purpose databases like SQL Server allow arbitrarily complex queries.  These queries may involve joins: where rows from two or more tables are combined into a new temporary  table  satisfying the query.  Queries are expressed via a variety of formats, like ISAM keys and OLEDB query cells.  Entire languages exist for queries, SQL being the most well known. Databases remain consistent via transactions.  A transaction enforces ACID semantics: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.  Transactions are used to arbitrarily combine multiple changes into a single operation.  Atomicity means either all changes within the transaction occur or do not occur; some changes never occur.  This incredibly powerful semantic enables programmers to make rich transformations without ever worrying about the failure of each transformation.  Consistency means the database state is always transformed from one consistent state to another; when consistency is violated, the enforcement code simply aborts the transaction.  Isolation means that transactions executing in parallel appear after the fact to have occured serially.  Isolation is a complicated topic.  Isolation levels describe the degree to which one transaction sees its own and others' changes.  Deadlocks can result from concurrent transactions and are influenced by the isolation level, so deadlock resolution strategies are necessary.  Remote batch updates lead to further isolation difficulties.  Optimistic concurrency is one approach helpful in resolving those difficulties.  Durability means that no matter what else happens, once a transaction is commited, the changes will be persisted.  This requirement must be met even in the face of any machine or network crashes which occur after the transaction commits.  Transactions require databases to implement logging, and those logging facilities must be extremely robust to achieve durability.  Businesses learned long ago to always use transactions to transform the data on which the business depends. Distributed transactions enable databases on multiple machines and/or multiple different databases to participate in the transaction.  Databases are also referred to as resource managers, because they are responsible for durable resources.  Such transaction coordination requires a transaction manager.  Microsoft DTC (Distributed Transaction Coordinator) is an excellent example of a transaction manager.  A transaction manager must also log reliably.  Just about every major line-of-business database in the world can now participate in DTC coordinated transactions. Client-server architectures, which distribute work among personal "client" computers and shared "server" computers, come in 2 basic flavors: 2-tier and 3-tier.  A 2-tier architecture consists of a presentation tier talking to a data tier.  OLEDB is a great example of a 2-tier architecture.  A 3-tier architecture consists of a presentation tier talking to a middle aka business tier talking to a data tier.  CORBA is a good example of a component model specification which failed to specify a 3-tier architecture.  WinDNA is a good example of a vision based on the 3-tier architecture.  Line-of-business software refers to software on which the business itself depends, as opposed to personal productivity software, on which individuals depend.  Office is a good example of personal productivity software.  Years ago, the line-of-business software community realized that the 3-tier architecture was a great way of scaling to support huge numbers of clients. Appendix B: Design Considerations (a.k.a. Wow!  You Thought of All That?<g>) Getting multiple column values in one call: We are evaluating whether or not to replace or supplement the GetColumn call with a method which gets all column values at once...   Methods which currently work on a per-column basis include: ISimpleTableRead::GetColumn, ISimpleTableRead::GetColumnMeta, ISimpleTableWrite::GetWriteColumn, ISimpleTableWrite::SetWriteColumn, ISimpleTableControl::ChangeWriteColumn status.  All methods which work with columns currently do so on a per-column basis.  A multi-column behavior change would either require breaking this commonality or converting all column methods from per-column to multi-column.   The primary assumed benefit of of multi-column methods is performance improvement.  Is this assumption accurate?  First, recall that getting column values in Simple Tables involves pointing the caller to the actual data, not copying the data itself.  Basically, when getting n column values, this would eliminate n-1 in-process double-indirected function calls, which basically boils down to parameter pushes and a call and return, since the function pointer tends to end up in a register.  Also note that the function call will typically be in the CPU cache.  n-1 iterations of parameter checking would also be eliminated.  Making use of such a method does require allocating n pointers, where n should be determined based on meta information.  This actually adds a heap allocation in many cases where we currently just re-use a single pointer on the stack, and in those cases the heap allocation could very well result in worst performance than the n per-column gets without a heap allocation.  In order to see any gain, the multi-column method would need to be designed such that it did not itself require an allocation, and callers would need to write their code so that their array of pointer allocations were per table or per process as opposed to per row. The majority of code in the COM+ 1.0 product actually gets and sets only a few of the column values per row.  Converting from a per-column to all-column approach would likely degrade performance in those scenarios.  Speaking to developers who have used simple tables a lot, the general consensus was that they liked the per-column approach for their usages, and viewed an all-column approach as complicating their code.  So we would need to support getting a subset of column values or single column value too. More performance considerations.  I investigated an icecap report in a writing scenario.  Several GetColumn implementations were profiled.  5 of 7 implementations ranged from 300 to 600 cycles per call, so gains would have to be pulled from that range of cycles.  The other 2 implementations averaged 92 and 1772 cycles respectively.  Better gains might be achieved simply by optimizing the implementations.  These proportionally low cycle counts are offset by the potential number of calls.  Note that the count of columns for any table will not be huge: O(100) is a safe bet.  The largest count in COM+ 1.0 is just under 40.  However, the number of rows can be huge.  This scaling however is offset by that fact that scenarios where we query for the total set of rows and then get all column values are a bit artificial, seldomly occuring in the rather large code base for COM+ 1.0.  The typical queries and operations tend to scope the count of rows to small numbers. Note that because the disk is involved in write scenarios, not to mention OOP or even network calls, performance gains in getting and setting column values in read and write caches have a negligible effect on overall performance.  Also note that catalog code has never shown up in the top performance bottlenecks in runtime scenarios for the COM+ 1.0 product.  Since the main reason for the proposed change is an assumed performance gain, and since COM+ 1.0 performance tests have not shown the current design to be a bottleneck, one approach to this issue would be to not change or replace the current design until we measure a real performance scenario in which the current per-column approach shows up as a bottleneck. There are costs to converting to a multi-column approach.  As mentioned, given that all column methods are currently per-column, we would either need to update all of them or live with the introduced inconsistency.  Also, since we still need to support per-column and multi-column as opposed to just all-column usages, we would be complicating the model by introducing more than one way to accomplish the same thing.  Note that any approach other than supplying an array of pointers would make calling code very brittle to schema extensions.  While we can argue that is acceptable because our schema freezes when we ship, the COM+ 1.0 experience has shown that dealing with schema changes where the such brittleness exists is very costly, and that schema evolves rapidly, and that schema changes after beta releases. For now, we have decided to retain the per-column approach to all interactions with columns in Simple Tables (4/6/99). P.S.: Here are some perf results from COM+ 1.0 for getting column values in the scenario of creating 5 new applications with one component each: Data table #calls avg cycles per call ================================== ======= ============== (read only regdb) CSimpleTable::GetColumn (fast cache regdb) CSimpleTable::GetColumn (fast cache) CSLTShapeless::GetColumn (fixed) CSDTFxd::GetColumn 111121 The fixed data table obviously screams.  Interestingly though, the read-only regdb (which implements its own cache) is 4.5 times slower than the fast-cache implementation employed by most of the other data tables.  The read-write regdb sits atop the fast-cache and is only about 0.25 times slower.  The read-only regdb implementation takes locks and (at least sometimes) allocates and copies.  This clearly evidences the expense of doing doing so (5/20/99). I have re-opened this issue.  I have asked Wenjunq to investigate the poor performance in the abovementioned scenario of the read-only regdb data table.  I have also dug deeper into the icecap and noticed that with the fast-cache implementation, about 33% of the time appears to be consumed in the virtual GetColumn method on the simple table which wraps the non-virtual InternalGetColumn method of the fast cache.  This indicates that the fast cache (and the fixed cache) are sufficiently fast that the call cost may come into play as significant.  I have asked Varshaj to implement and performance test a GetRowValues method on the fixed and fast caches (5/25/99). <todo>The exciting results Enabling the getting and setting of multiple row </todo> Query format issues: Are query cells still sufficient?  Are other operators besides equality and inequality necessary?  Can we drop the type and size specifier for query cells passed to the table dispenser?  Should we go with copy/no copy this time? Given an array of query cells, more than one cell containing the same cell identifier implies an OR expression among those cells, and cells with different cell identifiers implies an AND expression among those cells.  Therefore, query cells only support OR ing expressions applied to the same column and AND ing expressions applied across columns.  One additional field in the cell structure would be required to increase flexibility: namely a connector indicating whether to AND or OR two adjacent cells.  This however does not buy much, queries involving that level of complexity also typically require parenthetical expressions too.  A query language would be more appropriate in those scenarios. Query cells have some big advantages over a query language: Because they are significantly simpler, they are significantly easier to implement.  Therefore they make a great least-common-denominator query format across all table implementations. An array of query cells is already parsed, eliminating the need for and overhead of a parser.  Queries executed at runtime as part of the execution environment are typically simple and must be extremely fast. Query cells are powerful enough in most cases.  COM+ 1.0 demonstrated this.  Raid usage on the COM+ team also demonstrates that most raid queries are expressible as query cells (and those that are not are well expressed with SQL). For now, we will continue to use query cells as the least-common-denominator query format for simple tables.  This of course does not preclude supporting query languages in selected scenarios or across the board in the future (5/11/99). For now we will continue to support the equality and non-equality operators.  Additional operators can be supported as actual demands arise.  We will continue to require that the caller specify the column/cell type in their query cells.  This simplifies and speeds up the table dispenser because the dispenser need not determine types via meta lookup (which can require roundtrips to the server on clients).  The type must be known to marshal the query.  The size however can easily be determined either the type is a fixed-length type or for strings where wcslen can be used.  In these cases the size need not be specified.  For DBTYPE_BYTES, the size is required even when the meta specifies a fixed length, because the dispenser would need to perform a meta lookup to determine that.  After discussion with development team today (people who used simple tables extensively for COM+ 1.0), we decided that the query will be copied within the table dispenser s GetTable call.  Conceptually the dispenser makes the copy, but really it is the underlying data table.  This allows developers the convenience of updating and re-using their query cell array between GetTable calls and eliminates the confusion with the old lifetime issues (ie: the caller had to keep their query unchanged until releasing the table) (5/11/99). Is MoveToRowByIdentity necessary?  Is it sufficient? MoveToRowByIdentity, while less common than positional row navigation, is used quite a bit in COM+ 1.0.  MoveToRowByIdentity seeks through the read cache for a single row by its unique primary key identity.  Single rows however are more commonly (and efficiently in most cases) sought by specifying their identity in the query.  MoveToRowByIdentity could be expanded to seek for a row by arbitrary criteria instead of just by primary key.  The semantics of this are much more complicated, and so is the implementation.  Basically, you would end up supporting querying within the cache.  And if you are going to do that, you might as well do it right: i.e.: implement filters and views.  We have considered filtering, viewing, and sorting in the past.  They were deemed too complicated for COM+ 1.0 and were not sorely missed.  These advanced usages can be done above the cache anyway.  If we ever do support these, they will require a new interface, as opposed to just some changes to one method (ie: MoveToRowByIdentity), so for now the plan is to just keep the existing call as is (5/12/99). Should we strongly differentiate inserts vs updates and enforce the implications? AddRowForInsert and AddRowForUpdate are inconsistenly named with AddRowForDelete.  The latter actually adds a row marked for deletion to the write cache, whereas the former begins adding the row for insert or update to the write cache, but does not complete it until SetRow is called.  Also, we have seen the need to abort a row change as opposed to complete it.  Currently the change must completed and then marked to be ignored via the simpl table control interface.  However, validation logic on SetRow may fail by calling it prematurely, where such failure is not desired. The only difference between the two methods is that AddRowForInsert does not copy the row from the read cursor, and marks the row for insertion instead of update.  Even though AddRowForUpdate copies the row from the read cursor, it does not necessarily imply an update to that row: all the caller needs to do is change the primary key columns.  Perhaps we should restrict the case of updating rows to disallow primary key changes? Perhaps we should allow the case of inserting to do so from a copy of the row from the read cursor, as opposed to just restricting it to a totally new row?  This gets into the issue of applying defaults.  In COM+ 1.0, the admin api had default values as part of its meta.  Since we are adding defaults to the schema, those defaults will be automatically supplied to new rows for insertion.  However, IIS5 has a different model for URL properties: when you add a new URL, you inherit all the properties set on the ancestors.  The COM+ 1.0 model can be described as: when inserting a row, apply the defaults from the schema.  The IIS5 model can be generalized to: when inserting a row, apply the defaults from some data.  The difference between the two models is that in the first, defaults come from the schema, whereas in the other, defaults come from some data. So we need to decide whether we want to support picking up defaults from the schema only, or also from   data.  We already know we ll support defaults in schema.  A simple way to support defaults from some data would be to express an operation which creates a new row for insertion from the read cursor row.  This row can be chosen by arbitrary querying.  This supports both the IIS5 URL property approach of obtaining defaults from an inheritance chain, as well as an approach where a user specifies their own prefered defaults. After a bit of discussion, the above issues have filtered down to: Do we semantically differentiate inserts from updates? In version 1, we initially did not do that, since we allowed inserting rows which already existed and updating rows which did not.  This semantic was useful for internal logic.  An insert or update in one table could trigger further changes to other tables.  With this semantic it was un-necessary for the code triggering the further changes to first determine which operation was appropriate: insert or update.  More importantly though, it was simpler to implement because it did not require existence checking.  During the COM+ 1.0 development cycle, we realized we did need to distinguish between insert and update in many cases.  Thus, insert behavior when the row already exists and update behavior when it does not became a choice and therefore became part of the meta.  And because this enforce was done via an integrity logic table which worked across all tables, the issue of existence checking in many places became a non-issue.  The issue at hand is whether or not choice in this case is really necessary.  We know we cannot live with just the original behavior.  Can we live with just the newer behavior? Upon consulting with the various developers, it seems we can live with inserts and updates being semantically different.  This has some important implications.   First, inserting a row which already exists always fails and updating a row which does not exist always fails.  Second, when inserting a row, the primary key columns can and must be set (but the meta may specify a default setting via guid generation for example), and when updating a row, the primary key columns cannot be changed.  Note that power developers can work around these restrictions simply by using the controller interface to change the row action.  Third, the means for changing the identity (ie: altering primary key columns) of an existing row becomes clear.  Originally, one could mistakenly assume that this change would occur by doing a row update and altering the primary key (this would instead just add another row, although a logic table could intercept the request and remove the old row).  Now it becomes clear.  The caller must add the row for insert and alter the identity in the inserted row and must also add the row for deletion.  This leads to the fourth implication: callers must be able to add a new row for inserting, or add an existing row for inserting (where they alter its identity) to pickup all the existing properties.  While this could be accomplished with a choice parameter on AddRowForInsert, it can just as easily be accomplished without altering the existing interfaces by moving to the appropriate read row, adding a row for insert, and transfering the read row properties via manually via GetColumnValue/SetWriteColumnValue. There are some problems with enforcing insert and update semantics always.  Perf, who does it, and legacy.  The perf concern is that enforcing this behavior obviously costs more: the question is how much.  The concensus for now is that we can always special case internally and only if it evidences itself as a common bottleneck do we need to add the option to the meta.  The  who does it  concern is that the enforcer can either be the datastore, data table/logic table, or integrity table.  Basically in the meta we need to express whether the integrity table is expected to enforce it.  Obviously the cheapest means of enforcement is in the datastore itself.  The legacy concern is what code do we break which already requires the old semantic?  It looks like the old semantic is required by component install, but this is simply because the joined class table schema did not originally adequately express the notion of classically-registered vs self-described and non-configured vs configured; also, roles could originally be added if they already existed, but this was corrected later in the dev cycle. A more appropriate naming convention for the insert/update methods would therefore be:  BeginAddRowForInsert  BeginAddRowForUpdate CompleteAddRow AbortAddRow (5/18/99). Should we support bulk deletes and updates? We already support bulk reading by query.  The concept of bulk deletes and updates here means you specify a query, and indicate that all rows resulting from the query should either be deleted or updated.  The critical feature is that the query is not actually executed and the read cache is not actually populated in order to perform the bulk operation.  This is a performance optimization.  However, given that you can bulk query, and we can already marshal all the results in one trip, and that you can add all the rows for update or deletion entirely in process to the write cache, and that the pending changes are all marshalled in bulk back to the server in one trip, bulk deletes and updates is already fairly optimized.  Further gains by eliminate the initial population and marshaling are offset by signficant problems with insuring that logic still gets faulted in during these bulk operations. We extensively discussed a couple means of accomplishing this extra optimization and their implications.  The first means was to support methods for adding all rows for deletion or update to the write cache without actually requiring population of the read cache.  This approached ended in a dead-end because logic tables sitting atop the data table would not see the changes on UpdateStore if the call was initiated from the server.  Even when initiated from the client, a solid amount of marshalling trickery would be necessary to make it all work. The second means was having a query cell which indicated the resulting rows should be deleted.  This would be implemented by actually carrying out the update on the server during the GetTable call.  While this insured the write cache would properly reflect the changes (the write cache needs to have all the deletes or updates so that logic can process each individually as it normally does) whether the call was initiated on the client or server, significant marshalling issues were still present specifically when handling detailed errors.  Not only would detailed errors need marshalled back during the GetTable, since the errors could have been either with the population or resulting update, the read or write cache would also need marshalled back.  While we can see how to make these changes to the code, it is a lot of work, and there are no doubt further unforeseen implications. The need for such a bulk delete mechanism was obvious with MTS2, but this was because the cost of populating was far too high.  While both populating and updating performance has been vastly improved with the simple table implementation in COM+ 1.0, the admin api is still navigation based, meaning in order to perform certain bulk deletes, n populates and updates need performed to do so, resulting in plenty of roundtrips.  Simple tables supports much richer quering, and with the plan for the admin api to do the same, these cases disappear or become extremely rare.  Also, the population which occurs when doing huge amounts of changes on very large registrations has not been in the bottleneck list recently in the COM+ 1.0 implementation.  For all these reasons, supporting bulk deletes/updates without initial population has been postponed for now (5/19/99). Also getting and setting column values by name? While internal code gets and sets column values by index (significantly more efficient than by string), the admin api gets and sets by name.  The admin api in COM+ 1.0 has a fast map between name and index.  Those fast maps are filled in by the admin api s own hard-coded meta.  With simple tables v2, those maps can and must be built from the column meta dynamically.  We enterained the idea of supporting get/set column methods by name in the tables themselves.  This adds 3 new methods which every data and logic table must implement and means every table needs to load and retain strings.  This was deemed too much overhead since the map could be built from the meta database on the fly for the few consumers that actually require it (5/20/99). Ditch CompleteAddRow/AbortAddRow? Radu, Emily, and I, in discussing edit rules as part of the meta database today, slipped into a continuing discussion on the admin api using simple table caching directly rather than rolling more caching on top.  That discussion led to the following (simplifying) proposal: Ditch the model for inserting and updating rows where one BeginAddRowForUpdate/Insert is followed by n SetWriteColumnValues and conclude by one CompleteAddRow/AbortAddRow.  The new and simpler model is to do away with CompleteAddRow/AbortAddRow altogether.  The add-row methods become: AddRowForDelete, AddRowForUpdate, and AddRowForInsert.  Each of these methods positions the write row cursor on a new row in the write cache.  SetWriteColumnValues can be called at any time while the cursor remains on the row. What does this buy us?  Two big advantages: This allows the administrative api to support its current model where a caller can roam the collection and change any of the objects in any order (including partially changing one, changing another, and completing the first) up until saving their changes. This also eliminates the need for internal callers to retain buffers for all their value changes until calling Complete/AbortAddRow.  This need to retain those buffers has bit just about every first time user of simple tables. What do we lose?  The original two reasons for supporting CompleteAddRow were: A performance optimization to minimize allocations and copies.  The intention was to allow implementations to do a single allocation per row rather than per column.  Our fast cache implementation, the primary cache used for writing, actually does much better than this.  It maintains two buffers, one for fixed data and one for variable data, and each time it needs to grow a buffer it doubles its size.  The net effect is that the implementation is already doing significantly less allocations than one per row.  There is a cost of additional un-necessary copying, which also adds dead data to the variable buffer, in a very limited scenario.  Namely, on an AddRowForUpdate, each variable length column value changed by the caller would be copied twice, once from the read cache, and once from the caller's data, whereas each was previously copied only once.  However, this extra cost can be eliminated by doing this fixup in the fast cache in PreUpdateStore. A place to inject validation logic.  Validating a row as a whole cannot be done on column sets, since the validation needs to occur once the caller is done.  The one standard validation which needs a home is validating that all non-nullable column values were set on an inserted row.  We still need to perform this validation, but will probably instead end-up doing it on UpdateStore.  This validation would need to occur on the client-side. The caller needs discard their pointers into the write cache when calling AddRowFor* or even SetWriteColumnValues, since any of those calls might require buffer re-allocation.  <todo>This needs formally defined as part of the write cache semantics.</todo> (6/8/99). Making proper use of COM? Radu, Wenjun, Murat and I discussed today why we use CoCreateInstance in the binding process.  Originally, the binding process was entirely CoCreateInstance-based.  In COM+ 1.0, since we had to run inside the SCM and since we had to service CoCreateInstance requests, we had to run in a mode where CoCreateInstance would not be used in the binding process (otherwise we would infinitely recurse).  The wiring database contains initial mapping information which the table dispenser uses to select an implementation dispenser which can choose the appropriate table implementation for the job.  Really what this means is that we have an idenity-to-implementation mapping database, just like the COM HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry, but  idenity  is a more granular, sophisticated, domain specific concept, as are the mappings.  What we did originally was store the CLSID for the implementation dispenser.  To support operation without COM CoCreateInstance, we also stored the module name, and then did what CoCreateInstance itself does: load the module and call DllGetClassObject with the CLSID to get the class factory for the implementation dispenser.  However, we also wanted to leverage COM+ transactions and role-based security.  To do so, we needed to also be able to CoCreateInstance everything to flow the transaction and security information, or so we thought. As it turns out, due to the in-process semantic and concurrency semantic fundamental to simple tables, we always run in the caller s context and therefore never  block  the flow of transaction and security information during the binding process, so CoCreateInstance is totally un-necessary during the binding process.  All we have to do to insure that context information flows is to use CoCreateInstance when we go out of context, which we already do.  Namely, when the client table, used by the admin api, wants to talk to the catalog server, it (naturally) CoCreateInstances it.  Thus context information flows across the context boundary.  What all this means is that we actually do not need to use COM CoCreateInstance at all for the binding process (since we have our own  registry , the wiring database, so therefore indirecting to another  registry  is artificial anyway). Since we don t need to use CoCreateInstance, what would not using it buy us?  Actually quite a bit. We would not need to implement DllRegisterServer/DllUnregisterServer. We could opt to use a different entry point than DllGetClassObject which would also allows to drop class factories from the binding process.  Class factories are pretty irritating because they just cost us without buying anything, since implementation dispensers are a special sort of class factory anyway.  We actually ended up implementing the class factory on the implementation dispenser itself to eliminate creating yet another object (well actually several when you consider common binding scenarios).  Instead, we could implement DllGetDispenser (REFGUID i_clsid, REFGUID i_iid, LPVOID* o_ppv). Thus we would not need to implement class factories. We would eliminate the overhead of CoCreateInstance, which is important, given that it is un-necessary, and given our performance requirements. Minor: we would always run in the caller s context.  You couldn t mistakenly run in another context by declaring the wrong threading model. Supporting side-by-side drops becomes a lot less complicated (because we would not need to register (n+1)*(count of implementation dispensers) in the registry). Bootstrapping is still necessary to obtain the table dispenser itself.  Callers link with a lib which implements the GetSimpleTableDispenser api.  This api needs to choose the right implementation for the product.  See the discussion regarding side-by-side support for how this works in detail (6/17/99). Providing side-by-side drops of simple tables: Should we do it and how? The catalog will be used in both the URT and AS.  We are already providing private drops to specific teams.  DLL hell comes from shared components and the catalog is a  shared  component.  Because simple tables have their own  registry  mechanism (the wiring database), side-by-side drops are certainly do-able.  Since the URT and AS will be installed on the same machines, and since both will evolve throughout the development cycle, and since both depend on the catalog, it makes sense to isolate them from incompatibilities between their catalog drops. Here is how we can do it (see the discussion on the proper use of COM first): Each product gets its own copy of the primary catalog dll, appropriately renamed for the product.  During product setup, this dll must be copied into a location on the path.  Setup must LoadLibrary the primary catalog dll, and call the exported function RegisterCatalogByProduct (HINSTANCE i_hinst, DWORD i_eProduct). RegisterCatalogByProduct, under a well-known key in the registry, it adds the product ID as a named value and its own base file name as the value. Simple table callers link to a static lib which implements GetSimpleTableDispenser.  When they call this api with their product ID, the code looks up the product ID in the registry, calls GetModuleHandle to see whether the dll is already loaded, and if not, calls LoadLibrary.  The exported function GetTableDispenser (HINSTANCE i_hinstance, LPVOID* o_ppv) is called to obtain the table dispenser, a singleton. The implementation dispenser supporting the wiring database is a well-known CLSID assumed to be accessible in the same dll as the dispenser.  GetImplementationDispenser (REFGUID i_clsid, REFGUID i_iid, LPVOID* o_ppv) to obtain the wiring database. Each product will need its own meta and wiring configuration file.  The modules specified will need to be those specific to the product.  The cookdown utility will simply need to know the name of the dll into which to embed the meta and wiring database from the specified configuration file. (6/18/99). Drop the multiple stateful cursors approach in favor of stateless  cursoring Radu and I were discussing how the table dispenser could be built as a singleton.  Unless we decided to obtain the meta tables on the stack, we would need to clone the cursor for each separate caller.  Radu suggested adding a non-cursor-based hack to the meta table implementation specifically.  I noted that if this was a problem for the table dispenser it was potentially a problem for any singleton using simple tables.  I then began investigating whether or not we discard the cursor oriented approach altogether.  After going through all the interfaces and the fast cache and fixed cache implementations (and checking with Wenjun regarding the CLB cache implementation), it looks like we can dramatically simplify the interfaces and cache implementations by eliminating the cursor-based approach.  The row navigation methods (which are by index) will be eliminated completely.  Row navigation by identity will simply return a row index.  Getting and setting column values will requiring specifying the row index as well.  Clone cursor will be dropped.  This will allow multiple threads into one read cache, for example, without requiring a cursor per thread.  Of course, since we hand out pointers into the cache directly, the caller will still need to manage locking everyone out should the cache need repopulated (6/21/99). Is a super lightweight version of the fast cache of value? The fast cache implementation is fast, but since it supports both read-only and read-write scenarios, as well as multi-cursor scenarios, it is fatter than need be for a runtime read-only fetch.  The question is: is it worth making a super-lightweight version of the fast cache with super-lightweight data table shell atop, optimized for read-only, populate-once fetches of one or a few rows?  Would this benefit runtime scenarios which currently cache again atop simple tables?  Could it alleviate some of the secondary caching? Should an instance of the table dispenser be created on each GetSimpleTableDispenser call or should it be created once per process or should it be created once per scope? Spoke with Wenjun and we agreed her need for scoping should be implemented inside the implementation dispenser for CLB rather than be exposed to either the table dispenser or callers. <TODO/> Optimistic concurrency: Will it really meet our needs? <TODO/> What about queries for matches in a table against another table where no direct primary-foreign key relationship exists? <TODO/> Do we support the configured component in many applications scenario with cascading deletes?  I.e.: Do we support reference counting and cleanup on shared resources?  Yes to both. <TODO/> Do we need a MoveToRowByIdentity on the write cache too? <TODO/> Need to investigate SQL-like query support in WMI scripting. How real is it?  How complicated is it to implement?  Is there a minimum baseline of support required of all providers and if so what is it? </TODO>  Appendix C: Changes From Simple Tables v1 (a.k.a. I m Already a Simple Table Guru, Just Tell Me What Changed In general All the clsids and iids have been rev ed, even for interfaces which did not change, to allow side-by-side operation with COM+ 1.0 in W2K.  Various minor name changes have occurred (eg: reserved cell indexes are now named iST_CELL_* instead of iST_COLUMN_*: the original did not make much sense, since reserved cells are not really columns in any table).  The name changes made were done for clarity moving forward.  Error codes have been improved and expanded as well and some common detailed errors have been specified.  See the discussion  Regarding constants and structures  for details. Regarding obtaining tables GetSimpleTableDispenser api now takes a product ID for side-by-side isolation of the simple table core.  CoCreateInstance of the table dispenser is no longer supported. The caller no longer requests a client vs server table via ISimpleTableDispenser::GetClientTable/GetServerTable.  All tables now obtained via one call: ISimpleTableDispenser2::GetTable.  Whether or not a client table is chosen now depends on whether the level-of-service specifies runtime work (the default) or configuration-time work (via fST_LOS_CONFIGWORK) and whether the query requires going off computer (eg: iST_CELL_COMPUTER or iST_CELL_CLUSTER is used in the query).  If configuration-time work is specified, the caller will always receive a client-side table and all populates and updates will pass through the administration process.  If the query requires going off computer, a client table will also be automatically supplied.  Otherwise, a server table will be provided. The level-of-service flags have been altered such that the most common usages are assumed by default (eg: to obtain a read-only table, you originally requested the fST_TABLE_READONLY level-of-service, whereas now a read-only table is the default, and to request a read-write table you specify fST_LOS_READWRITE).  Increasing the level-of-service also decreases the maximum potential performance, so no level-of-service requests naturally allows for the highest potential performance.  See the discussion  Regarding constants and structures  for details. Databases and tables are now identified by UNICODE strings rather than GUID types. The caller need not specify the size of the data in their query cells if the table dispenser can easily determine it.  The array of query cells passed to the table dispenser are now copied within the GetTable call, allowing the caller to either discard or alter their copy once the call returns.  Previously the caller had to retain their copy as-is until they released the table obtained from GetServer/ClientTable.  The query meta for query cells now takes the address of the count of cells rather than the count of cells directly.  The new query format with these changes is eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS. Regarding working with tables (reading) The table returned by GetTable is already populated unless the fST_TABLE_UNPOPULATED flag is specified. The cursor-based approach has been eliminated.  The row index of interest is now simply specified when obtaining column values.  This allowed elimination of ISimpleTableRead methods RestartRow, MoveToNextRow, MoveToRowByIndex, and CloneCursor.  MoveToRowByIdentity is replaced by GetRowIndexByIdentity which takes the row identity as before but now simply supplies the corresponding row index.  The cursor-less approach results in fewer methods, simpler and faster implementations, and less surface area for testing. ISimpleTableRead::GetColumn call has been replaced by GetColumnValues to support obtaining multiple column values at once.  Column values are still obtained via pointers, not copying.  Support includes obtaining one column value per call, a specific set of column values per call, a range of column values per call, or all column values in one call.  The count of column values of interest is always specified, along with an array of column indexes of interest (which can be NULL, which simply fetches column values for column s 0 to count of columns - 1).  An optional array of sizes is specified which will be filled in if specified.  An array of pointers must be supplied which will point to the column values requested.  For single column value requests, this is just a pointer to one pointer.  Otherwise, this is an array of pointers whose count must be highest column index requested + 1.  When a subset of column values is requested, only those pointers will be filled. PopulateCache is no longer necessary unless the caller wants to re-execute the query or delay query execution, and almost no callers do that.  This is therefore an advanced method and has been moved to the new ISimpleTableAdvanced interface. GetTableMeta no longer supplies the database/table identity, query, and service level.  These were never requested in the COM+ 1.0 source, the caller knows them anyway, and the actual query retained by the table and service level requested can both change during the binding process (to be correct, the call should supply exactly what the caller specified, and that would requiring keeping it around and flowing it all the way down).  Eliminating the need to provide the database and table identity allows lightweight implementations to not store them.  GetTableMeta now supplies table properties, similar to how GetColumnMeta supplies column properties (a.k.a. column meta flags) and the table version (actually the base version). Regarding working with tables (writing) As for reading, the cursor-based approach has been eliminated, allowing removal of RestartWriteRow and MoveToNextWriteRow.  GetWriteRowIndexByIdentity has been added to match the corresponding method available on the read cache.  To support the cursor-less approach, AddRowForInsert now supplies the write row index of the added row, AddRowForUpdate now takes a read row index and supplied the write row index of the copied row, and AddRowForDelete now takes a read row index. The SetRow method has been removed.  Thus, there is no longer an  adding  state for changing rows added for insertion or update.  Calling AddRowFor* simply adds a new row to the write cache.  Column values can be set on the row at any time.  All row-level validations previously done in SetRow must instead occur during UpdateStore. The semantic differences between inserting and updating a row has been strengthened and made formal.  For the insertion of row into the datastore to succeed, the row must not already be present (previously either behavior was supported on a case-by-case basis, with the opposite semantic being the default).  For the update of a row in the datastore to success, the row must be present (previously either behavior was supported on a case-by-case basis, with the opposite semantic being the default).  When adding a row into the write cache for insert, the primary key columns must be specified unless they are already defaulted by the meta.  When adding a row into the write cache for update, the primary key columns cannot be changed. SetWriteColumn and GetWriteColumn have been replaced by SetWriteColumnValues and GetWriteColumnValues, with equivalent semantics to GetColumnValues.  All values supplied during a SetWriteColumnValues call are copied during the call: previously, the caller was required to retain their copy of each changed value until SetRow was called.  The SetWriteColumnValues semantic for the size parameter has changed from requiring the size to be 0 when the size can be determined from the type, meta, or data to guaranteeing that the size will simply be ignored when the size can be determined from the type, meta, or data. Not halting processing of the write cache on the first detailed error has been formally defined as a requirement for UpdateStore implementations.  Applying none of the pending changes in the write cache whenever any detailed errors occur has also been formally defined as a requirement for implementations.  Another formalization regards writing column values to the datastore on inserts and updates: all column values are guaranteed to be written regardless of whether the caller changed them (unless the meta specifies otherwise). Regarding working with tables (advanced) A new interface, ISimpleTableAdvanced, contains methods which certain advanced callers other than storage and logic implementers require.  As mentioned, ISimpleTableRead::PopulateCache has been moved here because the first population is typically done by the table dispenser internally.  The GetDetailedErrorCount and GetDetailedErrrors methods from ISimpleTableControl are also moved here. Eliminating the cursor-based approach has also made concurrency semantics simpler.  See the reference section on advanced table usage for details. Working with meta <todo/> Storage and logic plug-ins <todo/>Implementation dispensers <todo/>ChangeQuery eliminated Regarding constants and structures Level of service flags were prefixed with fST_TABLE_ and are now prefixed with fST_LOS_ (or fST_LOSI_ for internal level of service flags).  Most of the existing flags have been inverted, since in v1, specifying a flag was required to degrade service and increase performance, and in v2, specifying a flag increases services and potentially decreases performance. fST_TABLE_READONLY is inverted to fST_LOS_READWRITE. fST_TABLE_NONMARSHALLABLE is inverted to fST_LOS_MARSHALLABLE. fST_TABLE_SINGLECURSOR has been eliminated.  Simple tables are now cursorless. fST_TABLE_INCOMING and fST_TABLE_EMPTY have been eliminated.  They are not used due since fST_TABLE_UNPOPULATED fills the same purpose. fST_TABLE_NOLOGIC remains the same. fST_TABLE_CLIENTSIDE is an internal level of service and is thus renamed fST_LOSI_CLIENTSIDE. fST_TABLE_ALWAYSMARSHALLREAD was un-used and has been removed. The wiring information request enums (eST_WIRING_SERVER and eST_WIRING_CLIENT) were un-used and have been removed. The column meta flags were prefixed with fST_COLUMN_ and are now more appropriately prefixed with fST_COLUMNMETA. fST_COLUMN_INDEX is now fST_COLUMNMETA_CASEINDEX to indicate a case-sensitive index. fST_COLUMN_CASEINSENSITIVE was simply OR d with fST_COLUMN_INDEX to indicate a case-insensitive index.  fST_COLUMNMETA_NOCASEINDEX replaces this. fST_COLUMNSTATUS_DONTWRITE was a workaround hack and has been removed.  This is really column meta information.  The new column meta supports this concept. All simple table errors continue to be prefixed with E_ST_.  All error numbers themselves are new, even for errors which retain the same constant name (note that some error numbers were publicly exposed but the constant names were not). E_ST_NOMORE has been expanded into E_ST_NOMOREROWS, E_ST_NOMORECOLUMNS, and E_ST_NOMOREERRORS. E_ST_NOTNULLABLE has been replaced by E_ST_VALUEINVALID. E_ST_INVALIDCACHESTATE has been replaced by E_ST_INVALIDCALL. E_ST_LENGTHTOOBIG has been replaced by E_ST_SIZEEXCEEDED. E_ST_FOREIGNKEYMISSING has been replaced by E_ST_FKDOESNOTEXIST. E_ST_MISSINGROW has been replaced by E_ST_ROWDOESNOTEXIST. The detailed error indices iST_ROW_ALL and iST_COLUMN_ALL have been renamed iST_ERROR_ALLROWS and iST_ERROR_ALLCOLUMNS respectively. The population control flags were prefixed with fST_CONTROL_ and are now prefixed with fST_POPCONTROL: The fST_CONTROL_APPLYTOCACHE control flag was not used and has been removed. eST_QUERYFORMAT_1, which was the query cell array, is replaced.  eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS is a slight variation on the same query format: i_QueryMeta is now the address of the count of cells rather than the count of cells.  eST_QUERYFORMAT_2 was not used and has been removed. The query cell operators were prefixed with eST_OPERATOR_ and are now prefixed with eST_OP_. The reserved cell indexes were prefixed with iST_COLUMN_ and are now prefixed with iST_CELL_. iST_COLUMN_CMPNAME is now iST_CELL_COMPUTER. iST_COLUMN_DSNAME is now iST_CELL_CLUSTER. iST_COLUMN_JOINHINT was a bad design (the caller should never be required to specify from which direction to perform a table join) and has been removed. iST_COLUMN_SPECIAL_CUSTOM is renamed iST_CELL_SPECIAL. iST_COLUMN_TID, now iST_CELL_TID, will be removed once the meta database work is complete. The STQueryCell::iColumn member has been renamed iCell.

Insert/Update vs. single Put method Some stores require the distinction. Native config system currently does. WMI offers the option as a flag on a single Put method. For Beta 1: Single Put method with flag. Batch updates /   method Currently can t mix inserts, updates and deletes in a single file/store update operation. Punt for Beta 1 Query vs. Enumeration (aka QuerySelector vs. QueryClass) Main problem is confusion of concepts for people trying to do simple things.

Demonstrate to URT teams that the configuration system is real and provides many features "for free". Configuration system features Reading, writing, querying URT system configuration: Binding Policy AppDomain policy XSP config NOT covered:  Code access security Remoting config JIT/Debugging config Benefits: target application authors, not management tool authors Minimal number of  lines of code  / concepts for app authors Strongly typed classes In-process Programming model for configuration: Custom schema   XCOPY deployability Custom resolution: hierarchies, merges, stores   modularity for provider authoring Manageability through WMI Cover management tools through WMI and WMI+. WMI+: through native WMI provider to native config system only! Benefits of configuration system approach We (MarkusH) will provide a set of samples that illustrate the following benefits of the configuration system. These sample will be part of the COM+ 2.0 SDK. Text-based configuration Sample/Demo: Assembly version problems An app uses V1 of an assembly. V2 comes along and breaks the app upon installation. Open the config file for the app in notepad, add a line to force the app to bind against V1 of the assembly. The app works. Remote, text-based configuration Sample/Demo: The assembly versioning demo. The problem is fixed by connecting to the machine from a Linux box and editing the config file. Simple, efficient access through strongly typed classes Sample 1: Assembly binding policy configuration (as EXE). Sample 2: ASP+ <processmodel> configuration (as ASP+ app?) These samples will use the strongly typed accessor classes to illustrate: Compile-time type checking Auto-complete in the IDE Ability to read and write relatively complex XML files through a few lines of code. Generic consumers Sample: Configuration Browser (as ASP+ app?) This sample will use the IConfigItem/IConfigCollection interfaces to illustrate: Discoverability of configuration through schema Navigation through nested configuration (if ASP+ <security> can be accessed) Ability to write generic configuration UI ADO+ Data Binding/Data Designer support Sample: Binding Policy in the Data grid This sample will use the ADO+ Data Adaptor to illustrate: The ability to do data binding against configuration information. The ability to discover configuration information through the VS7 data browser. The ability to do simultaneous updates to multiple pieces of configuration information (if supported). Command-line scriptability (through WMI provider) This depends on the availability/quality of the WMI provider. MarkusH following up with TravisM. Sample: VBS script to fix assembly version problem Scenario above: Customer calls PSS. PSS sends a VBS script in e-mail. Customer clicks on the script and the app starts working. The sample uses the native WMI provider to illustrate: The lack of managed-code command-line script engines in VS7/COM+ 2.0. The benefit of a WMI provider for configuration information, and the scriptability of WMI. Exposure to WMI-enabled management tools Sample: CIM browser? Working with TravisM (WMI) to get a third-party WMI app that is (or could be made) COM+ 2.0 aware. If this doesn't work, we'll have to use the generic WMI/CIM browser This sample illustrates how The configuration system makes COM+ 2.0 config accessible to the WMI world (at no extra cost for the developer). Access through WMI+ Programmatic remote administration through WMI Sample: CIM browser This sample illustrates how The configuration system enables programmatic remote access to URT configuration information (at no extra cost for the developer). Extensibility This depends on us providing a schema extensibility mechanism; unknown cost at this time. We could use an embedded schema in the config file and change the table dispenser to fall back to the XML interceptor if it doesn't find schema through the fixed interceptor  Better to have customers ask for this feature (it's pretty obvious). Sample: Licensing limit of simultaneous users? Sample: Window Positions? Sample: MSMQ / DSN configuration? These samples would illustrate how Configuration is part of the core programming model for COM+ 2.0. Developers can get all the benefits of configuration "for free". Configuration system for app developers Guide devs towards recommended way of doing config. Get benefits (appcenter repl, wmi, APIs, text-based admin etc.). Rules/guidelines for schema? App-specific  island ? Suggested schema? Logical/Physical  mapper : adapt an app to a specific environment (AC 2.0). Revision History April 14, 2000 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH).

Goals Please refer to the overview presentation on   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/Slides/URT%20Configuration.ppt"  http://appcenter/config/Slides/URT%20Configuration.ppt  for the high level goals of the URT configuration system. Requirements Please refer to the requirements document on   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/URT1/URTConfigSysReq.htm"  http://appcenter/config/specs/URT1/URTConfigSysReq.htm  for a detailed list of requirements, broken up by consuming URT team.  Configuration Manager The Configuration Manager orchestrates discovery, retrieval, caching and update of configuration information. It is the core of an extensible architecture in which all specific functionality is implemented in the form of   mostly reusable   modules called Interceptors. Concepts In order to identify a specific piece of configuration information, two concepts are introduced: the ConfigurationType  and the Selector. Configuration Type: ConfigType The Configuration Type  (short Config Type) indicates the type of configuration information.  Examples:  Applications ScriptMaps Permissions Version Policies Configuration location: Selector In many cases, multiple instances of configuration information exist for a given Config Type, for example the Config Type  Application  may have an instance for the  401K App  and another instance for the  Payroll App When requesting configuration information the caller indicates the instance(s) of configuration for a specific Config Type using a  Selector . This selector is dependent on and scoped by the Config Type. The selector is often a URL, but whoever defines the Config Type is free to define one or more arbitrary URI s or even custom objects as selectors for this Config Type. The only limitation on the Selector is that it must have a protocol prefix.  In order to enable more efficient handling of selectors (pre-parsing of protocol prefix, handling of complex queries etc.), an abstract Selector class is defined: public abstract class System.Config.Selector {   public String  Protocol { abstract get;} The Configuration Manager is able to handle arbitrary classes derived from the Selector class.  However, some of its methods have special knowledge of the UrlSelector class: public class System.Config.URLSelector : Selector {   public  URLSelector(String s);   public String  Protocol{ override get };   public String  Argument{ get, set };   public bool  IsRootURL{ get, set };   public override String ToString(); class System.Config.UrlSelector : Selector { public:  UrlSelector(String s);  override String ToString(); String Protocol { override get, set };  String Argument { get, set }; Need to change code to UrlSelector (lower-case "rl") to conform to URT naming conventions. Another selector class, which is commonly used by administrative interfaces, is given here merely as an example to motivate the choice of introducing Selectors as objects: // Syntax:  configquery:<name1><op><value1>;<name2><op><value2> public enum System.Config.QueryCellOp { Equal,  NotEqual };  public class System.Config.QueryCell { String  Name; QueryCellOp  Operator; Object  Value; class System.Config.QuerySelector : Selector {   public:  enum QueryCellOp { Equal,  NotEqual };   struct QueryCell { String  Name; QueryCellOp  Operator; String  Value; public QuerySelector();   public QuerySelector(String s);   public String Protocol { override get; set };   public String FileName { get; set };   public String  override  ToString();   public  QueryCell  this[int Index] { get; set};    public void Add(QueryCell cell);   public void  Add(int Index, QueryCellOp Operator, Object Value){   public void Remove(int nIndex);   public int  Count { get }; Will callers typically have the URL as a single string, or will the prefix already be available separately? In the latter case, it might be good to provide a method with two separate parameters (Protocol, Selector) to avoid parsing/allocations. Configuration Manager Class  The Configuration Manager Class provides a simple set of functions to consumers of configuration information. Consumers range from administrative tools to the system runtimes themselves. enum System.Config.LevelOfService { Read =  0x0001; Write =  0x0002; Delete =  0x0004; Empty = 0x0008; NoValidation =  0x0010; NoInheritance =  0x0020; DoNotCacheResult =  0x0040; BypassCache =  0x0080; // others Need to validate this list! class System.Config.ConfigManager { public:  Object Get(String ConfigType, String selector, LevelOfService LoS);  Object Get(String ConfigType, Selector selector, LevelOfService LoS);  // The first flavor of the Get method assumes that the selector string is a UrlSelector.   // For all other selectors, the caller must create/cast to desired Selector class and  // call the second flavor of the Get method . Admin/Write methods are not currently implemented!  // Admin interfaces are not currently implemented  // IAdminCollection GetAdmin(String ConfigType, String selector, LevelOfService LoS);  // IAdminCollection GetAdmin(String ConfigType, Selector selector, LevelOfService LoS); // void Write(IAdminCollection Config); // void Write(IAdminCollection Config, LevelOfService los); // Utility methods primarily for use by interceptors  Object GetEmptyConfigCollection(String ConfigType, Selector selector, LevelOfService LoS);  Object GetEmptyConfigItem (String ConfigType, Selector selector, LevelOfService LoS);  Bool IsObjectCached(String ConfigType, Selector selector, LevelOfService LoS); Caching The Configuration Manager caches results of previous requests based on ConfigType and Selector. The LevelOfService parameter controls the caching behavior of a request. All objects returned from the cache must be read-only, in order to guarantee consistency of the running system. How exactly do we invalidate the cache? Do we have separate read and write caches? Do we even need a write cache? Can we use the XSP cache classes? Should wiring/meta indicate the possible/default caching behaviors for a config type? Behavior Wiring information The Configuration Manager uses the behavior Wiring information to determine how to return a representation of the configuration information being requested. The wiring behavior information maps a combination of ConfigType and Selector to a chain of managed classes that is to be invoked in order to render a configuration object. The Configuration Manager invokes each class in the chain of managed classes in order until one of the classes indicates that it has returned a fully rendered configuration object. These chained managed classes are referred to as Configuration Interceptors and are described in detail below. Example: <InterceptorWiring  ConfigType= Applications  Protocol=  InterceptorOrder =               InterceptorClass =  System.Config.Core.FileNameInterceptor               InterceptorType="Reader" /> <InterceptorWiring  ConfigType= Applications  Protocol=  InterceptorOrder =               InterceptorClass =  System.Config.Core.ComplibInterceptor              InterceptorType="Reader" /> Should we allow more than one chain for a type/selector combination to facilitate consumers with different rendering requirements for the same config information? Examples: runtime vs. admin, two different runtimes (DT/XSP) with different perf/access requirements. Behavior Wiring information is described in more detail in the   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/Schema & Behavior.doc"  Schema & Behavior specification section   REF _Ref465510285 \r   REF _Ref465510238 \p \h  below Configuration Objects Configuration objects provide an in-memory representation of configuration information, tuned to the requirements of the primary consumer of the configuration information. Configuration objects are returned by the Configuration Manager  and  GetEmpty  methods and consumed by the  Write  methods. Although the Configuration Interceptors invoked by the configuration manager can return any managed class, the requirements of administrative tools for a generic representation of configuration information can only be satisfied if the configuration object implements the generic configuration object interfaces defined below and thus provides a Configuration Schema for the configuration information. Configuration Schema The schema for configuration objects is typically described in an XML-data document. The format of the XML-data representation of configuration schemas is defined in the XML schema definition document ( HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/Schema & Behavior.doc" http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/Schema & Behavior.doc Collections Like XML Data, the schema represents configuration information as groups of typed and named properties. A group of properties is in turn named using a string, which corresponds to the Config Type as defined above. Example 1: Config Type:  Application Properties:   (String),  Location  (String),  AppEnabled  (Bool) Example 2: Config Type:  Machine Policy Properties:  JITCompiler  (enum ( Standard JIT Econo JIT CodeBufferMax  (DWORD) Items Some Config Types may have only a single instance (Example 2 above: there is only one  JITCompiler  property on a given machine), while others by nature contain many different instances (Example 1 above: Each application has a different  Location  etc.). These instances are hereafter referred to as  Configuration Items  or short  Items , a set of Configuration Items is referred to as a  Configuration Collection  or short  Collection TODO: add description of PublicRowName etc.  Primary Key In order to distinguish between different Items belonging to a specific Config Type, the schema declares one or more properties in the group as establishing the identity of the item. This set of properties is hereafter referred to as the  Primary Key  of the Config Type (the definition) or the  Primary Key  of the Item (the specific set of values). The Primary Key is often specified as part of the Selector to request a single instance of configuration information for a given Config Type. Example 1: Primary key:  Location Example 2: Primary key: N/A. Item Name Often, an Item must be referred to in a human readable form. In order to address this requirement, the schema designates one of the properties as the   of an Item. The property establishing the Name may or may not be part of the Primary Key, but should be  sufficiently unique  (for UI purposes) across different Item instances. Relations Often, two Config Types are related to each other, in the sense that the Items in one Config Type contain references to the Items in another Config Type, typically by listing the values of the Primary Key of these Items. The schema can capture these relations between Config Types to facilitate navigation between Config Types in administrative tools and to enable consistency checks. Obtaining Schema Information The schema for a given Config Type can be retrieved through the Configuration Manager, by using the Config Type  System.Config.Schema , and using the Config Type for which the schema is to be retrieved as the Selector string. Should this be the Config Type for schema? What s the Selector prefix? Example (using strongly typed Configuration Objects, see Section   REF _Ref463772039 \n \p \h  4.2.4 below  for details): SchemaCollection Schema=ConfigManager.Get( System.Config.Schema Applications for (int i=0; I<Schema.Count(); i++) Console.WriteLine(Schema[i].Name+ +Schema[i].Type+ // Resulting output: //    Name (String) Location (String) AppEnabled (Bool) Similarly, the Config Type  System.Config.Relations  retrieves relationship information: RelationCollection Relation=ConfigManager.Get( System.Config.Relation Applications For details on the available properties in the Schema and Relations collections, please refer to the XML schema definition document. Configuration Item and Configuration Collection The concepts defined by the schema (Config Type, Item Collection, Item) are expressed in the form of interfaces, in order to ensure that all configuration information can be accessed by administrative tools in a generic manner.   Configuration Item: IConfigItem interface public interface System.Config.IConfigItem : ICloneable {  Object this[int PropertyIndex] {get,set};  // the value of a Property Count {get}; // the number of properties  void Freeze(); // Makes the item read-only  bool IsFrozen { get }; // indicates if the item is read-only TODO: add detailed description of all the methods Should we make access to related config types obligatory? Configuration Collection: IConfigCollection interface public interface System.Config.IConfigCollection : ICloneable {  void  Add(IConfigItem Item);  // Adds an Item to the Collection  IConfigItem this[int Index] {get,set}; // Retrieves the Item   void Insert(int Index, IConfigItem Item); // Inserts an Item at position Index  void Remove(int Index);  // Removes an Item IndexOf(IConfigItem Item); // retrieves the index of a config item  void Clear();  // Removes all Items from the Collection  Count {get};  void  Freeze(); // makes the collection read-only  bool IsFrozen(); // indicates if the collection is read-only TODO: add detailed description of all the methods Need to sync up with new IList interface. Should we use code access security to protect the system from untrusted callers (i.e Clone before returning a cached config object)? How do we expose the schema itself for totally generic/late bound consumers? Of course  Schema ) just works but we may want an easier mechanism to discover properties, maybe on the collection object? Should we make access to related config types obligatory? A Config Collection that contains a single Config Item can be implicitly cast into a Config Item object. This enables intuitive coding for queries that always return a single Config Item (Example: query by full primary key). Can we make this cast part of the interface definition?  Base Configuration Objects The Configuration System provides a standard implementation of both Configuration Collection and Item objects: class System.Config.BaseConfigItem : IConfigItem, ICollectionICloneable public BaseConfigItem(LevelOfService losint ObjectCount); // all IConfigItem / ICollection methods class System.Config.BaseConfigCollection : IConfigCollection, ICollection public BaseConfigCollection(LevelOfService los); // all IConfigCollection / ICollection methods The Base Configuration Objects require that a Config Type be provided (via the IConfigCollection.ConfigType field), and that a schema for this Config Type be available through the Configuration Manager. If the behavior Wiring information does not specify a class to be used for a specific Config Type, the configuration manager returns Base Configuration Objects upon requests for this Config Type. Level Of Service The valid flags for Configuration Objects and their semantics are: LevelOfService Collection Allow reading of data Allow reading of data Write Allow changes to property values Allow addition of items Delete Invalid (Exception) Allow deletion of items from a collection NoValidation Performs no validation of property changes against edit rules in the schema Performs no validation of referential integrity (Primary Key semantics are still enforced) All other flags Invalid (Exception) Invalid (Exception) Do we want to use LoS for this or should we define another enumeration? TODO: need to spec out the exact semantics for property and relation validation. Strongly typed Configuration Objects The Configuration System generates two managed classes for each Config Type defined in the schema: A Configuration Item class with name  <ConfigType>Config  and a Configuration Collection class with name  <ConfigType>Collection . The Item class has fields for each of the properties and the fields are typed according to the type of the property. The Collection class has overridden methods for every method in IConfigCollection that uses IConfigItem, using the Item collection class instead of IConfigItem. <ConfigType> should really be the  PublicRowName PublicTableName . Need to update schema section accordingly. The generated classes derive from the ConfigItem and ConfigCollection base classes respectively. The behavior Wiring information for this Config Type must indicate the name of the Item and Collection class so that the Configuration Manager can instantiate and return the correct class(es). Generating Strongly Typed Configuration Objects The Configuration System provides a class (name and methods tbd) that generates strongly typed Configuration Objects for a specific Config Type. The classes are generated into a regular assembly (a DLL), that can be deployed as any other COM+ 2.0 class. The assembly must be within the assembly resolution scope of the Application Domain in which the Configuration Manager is invoked. A command line utility is provided that enables creating the objects at build time, typically at schema compilation time. Although technically feasible, no requirements are known to generate these objects automatically (on the fly) upon request. Custom Configuration Objects Any class that implements the IConfigItem or the IConfigCollection interfaces can be used with the Configuration System. Most interceptors interact with the Configuration Objects only through these interfaces. However it is possible to write specific interceptors that interact with Custom Configuration through arbitrary custom interfaces and methods. Custom configuration objects can derive from the Base Configuration Objects, the Strongly typed Configuration Objects or simply implement the IConfigItem/IConfigCollection interfaces in whichever way they see fit. Need to test that the generic interceptors work with arbitrary IConfigItem/IConfigCollection implementations. Should we provide utility classes that make it easy to add validation functionality to custom IConfig* implementations? If many scenarios require storing config information in completely customized/optimized data representations, this may be a good approach. Another approach is to provide a rich set of base config object implementations that provide common data structures. Should we allow custom objects to be instantiated from a config collection instead of forcing them to also be the collection object? Arbitrary Custom Objects in the Configuration Manager It is possible to use arbitrary objects (i.e. not implementing IConfigItem or IConfigCollection) within the Configuration System. Many standard interceptors may not work with these objects, but the Configuration Manager is largely agnostic of specific signatures of the objects returned from the last interceptor in the chain. Specifically caching of request results works also for arbitrary objects. Administrative tools will not be able to deal with arbitrary objects, nor is it guaranteed that the configuration information that these objects represent can be discovered via schema. Need to test that arbitrary objects work. How can we ensure that arbitrary objects in the cache are read-only? Configuration Interceptors The behavior Wiring information defines a chain of interceptors to be used for each Config Type. The Configuration Manager invokes the interceptors for Get and Write requests. Interceptors are stateless classes, i.e. they do not retain any invocation-specific state between method invocations. The Configuration Manager will create one or more interceptor instances and reuse them as it sees fit. The interceptors are responsible for their own synchronization. Interceptors must provide a default constructor. We really only use one instance at this time. Will we ever want to use more than one? Do we need/want to support a wiring flag that indicates that an interceptor wants to be stateful? Singleton interceptors (i.e. guaranteed at most one instance per app domain)? interface System.Config.Interceptors.IConfigReaderInterceptor {  Object Read( String ConfigType, Selector Selector, LevelOfService LoS, Object currentPreviousObjectConfig, // for chained interceptors: config read by previous // interceptor. NULL for store interceptors //interface System.Config.Interceptors.IConfigWriterInterceptor { //void  Write(IAdminCollectionObject adminConfigCollection, LevelOfService Los); Write interceptors are not currently implemented. public struct System.Config.Interceptors.RequestParams{ public String configType; public Selector selector; public LevelOfService los; interface System.Config.Interceptors.IConfigTransformerInterceptor {    voidRequestParams  Transform(ByRef String ConfigTypeKey, ByRef Selector Selector, ByRef LevelOfService LoS);  Should we use a struct as a return value instead of using ByRef? These method names are still under discussion. Should we split these into separate interfaces and refer to the resulting interceptor types more formally? Read operations A read operation read (i.e. an invocation of ConfigManager.Get or ConfigManager.GetEmpty) consists of three separate stages: A transform stage, in which zero or more interceptors can modify Config Type, Selector and LevelOfService before any data is retrieved. A read stage, in which at most one interceptor creates an initial, typically writeable Config Object and typically populates it with configuration data. A validation stage, in which zero or more interceptors can validate or modify the initial Config Object Need a better term for  validate , since these interceptors can do much more than just validation The behaviorWiring information for a Config Type declares the stages in which an interceptor is to participate.  The Configuration Manager controls the read operation and performs the three stages in order. In each of the stages the Configuration Manager only invokes interceptors that match the Config Type and Selector prefix being requested. It first invokes the interceptors for the Transform stage, in the order indicated in the Wiring behavior information. After invoking each interceptor it validates if the Config Type or Selector have changed, and if either have changed, it restarts the read operation for the new Config Type / Selector. If the Transform stage is completed without Config Type/Selector changes, the Configuration Manager invokes the interceptors that are marked to participate in the Read stage, again in the order indicated in the wiring behavior information.  As soon as one of the interceptor returns a Config Object, the Configuration Manager finishes the Read stage. If none of the interceptors return a Config Object, the entire read operation fails and the Configuration Manager raises an exception. The Configuration Manager then invokes the interceptors marked to participate in the Validation stage, again in the order indicated in the Wiring behavior information. After the Validation stage, the Configuration Manager sets the Selector and Config Type on the resulting Config Object (iff the Config Object implements the IConfigCollection or IConfigItem interface). If the LevelOfService indicates read-only, the Config Manager then converts the Config Object into read-only (by calling the ConvertToReadOnly method), before adding it to its cache (again obeying the LevelOfService). Write operations Need to add description of write details. Tbw (Stages: Transform, Validate, Write) Methods in details Need to describe the methods and their parameters. Typical usage patterns for Configuration Interceptors Need to fill these in. Single interceptor for a Key/Protocol combination 1 of n  interceptors for a Key/Protocol combination Chain of n interceptors for a Key/Protocol combination Hierarchy Interceptors Merge Interceptors Storage Interceptors Generally useful Interceptors Native Catalog Storage Interceptor This interceptor allows the managed config manager to obtain information from the native catalog. This is used to bootstrap the managed config system without the need to port the existing native interceptors (XML, CLB etc.). Schema Validation Interceptor This interceptor can be used in the validation stage to validate the contents of a config collection against the schema constraints for the config type, i.e. primary key, edit rules, relations to other collections etc.  Administrative Interfaces This section is just a collection of thoughts/fragments. Need to flesh out. The interfaces use the following class to facilitate handling of Primary Keys: class System.Config.ItemKey {  ItemKey(String PrimaryKey); // String of the form  <Name>=<Value>;<Name>=<Value>;...

IList interface. November 14, 1999 Rev 0.8 (MarkusH): Changed Wiring to Behavior. Updated classes/interfaces to reflect implementation.  The ConfigType was previously referred to as the  , but this terminology was multiply overloaded (Primary Key, ICollection method etc.).  In fact, the configuration system treats the schema information as just another piece of configuration information, and obtains it through the exact same extensibility mechanisms that apply to other configuration information. Only the  schema for the schema  is hard coded in most parts of the Configuration System. The Configuration System uses this flexibility to compile a core schema - that is known to the system at  ship time into a compact, binary representation stored inside the system binaries themselves. Other schema information is merged with the core schema using the standard configuration system mechanisms.  Even though typically the incoming config object is just modified and returned, an interceptor can also choose to create a new config object and populate it in whatever way it sees fit, including copying data from the incoming config object.

Making A Bunch of Silos Look Like One Product) Robert Craig Microsoft Confidential  TOC \o "1-3"  Introduction  PAGEREF _Toc453518200 \h  Part I: Ducttape  PAGEREF _Toc453518201 \h  The Configuration Manager  PAGEREF _Toc453518202 \h  The Cook-Down Process  PAGEREF _Toc453518203 \h  The XML-based Configuration Files  PAGEREF _Toc453518204 \h  Introduction (a.k.a. Why Text?  Why Binary?  Why Both?) The plan moving forward is to express configuration in text-based configuration files.  These text-based files become the  database of record  for configuration on a system.  Text-based configuration is attractive for numerous reasons: Configuration can be altered simply by editting text files: learning an api and writing code is not necessary. Configuration can be easily copied from one computer to another. Configuration can easily be backed up and restored. Configuration can manipulated remotely from extremely thin clients via tools as telnet. Configuration can be checked into a source control system as part of a development effort. Changes to configuration can be easily diff ed provided a history of snap-shots are maintained. Of course, a purely text-based configuration approach has various problems too: Not all configuration required by the underlying system can be expressed in text. The performance of reading configuration from text totally sucks. The performance of reading configuration from multiple text files sucks more. Each time configuration is read from text, that configuration must be fully validated. A user can totally cripple a system with innocent mistakes. Implementation/computer-specific configuration should not be exposed to users (provided it can be derived). To retain the advantages of text-based configuration and balance out the disadvantages, we employ a cookdown process, where text-based configuration is validated and cooked into one or more efficient, compact, binary, persisted caches.  The key design points of this cookdown model include: Text-based configuration is the  database of record The text-based configuration does not expose  implementation-specific  configuration which is derivable from implementation-agnostic configuration. Cooking the text-based configuration into the cooked-down format does full validation as part of the cooking. The cooked-down format is produced exclusively from the text format.  The cooked down format cannot itself be otherwise re-configured.   The cooked down format is not exposed to customers except via an encapsulating api. A cookdown process which fails because the configuration is totally bogus never results in the invalidation of a previous good cookdown. The details of this cookdown process and when it happens is encapsulated from the runtime system consuming the configuration. The runtime system consuming configuration only consumes from the cooked-down format. The cooked-down format consumed by the runtime system is always guaranteed to be  correct .  This means that vast volumes of code attempting to deal with bogus-ness need not be scattered throughout the runtime system. This cookdown approach retains the advantages of a text-based configuration approach and corrects the disadvantages: Configuration not expressible in text is still consumable by the runtime system. The performance of reading configuration text and reading from multiple files can be vastly improved. The process of performance improvements is encapsulated from the runtime system. Configuration validation only occurs during cookdown and cookdown need not happen each time configuration must be read. A user cannot cripple the system with bogus configuration provided a previously good cooking exists. Implementation- and computer-specific internal configuration is not exposed to users. Simple tables are used to both implement and encapsulate this cookdown process.  They encapsulate validation and transformation logic.  They also serve up the cooked configuration to the runtime system.  Because they encapsulate storage, callers are insulated from storage dependencies.  The runtime system sees the expected configuration.  Users can alter configuration either via editing text directly or via a helpful api.  This approach allows the runtime system to focus on being a runtime system, while the configuration system does its job. Part I: Ducttape The Configuration Manager (a.k.a. Encapsulating Configuration Further) The configuration manager (config_manager.cxx) encapsulates the process of extracting configuration for sites, application pools, and applications from the metabase and feeding that configuration into the ul-and-worker manager in the kernel.  When the ducttape service starts, the configuration manager is initialized.  Within this initialization, the configuration manager feeds the configuration for all application pools (one at a time), then all sites (one at a time), then all applications in each site (one at a time) into the ul-and-worker manager. The configuration manager is currently tied to the metabase.  It also implements a lot of validation logic.  The goal is to encapsulate this code from configuration storage, the cookdown process, and validation logic.  Here is a proposed code snippet which accomplishes this encapsulation via simple tables (error handling omitted): #define cAPPPOOLS_BASEVERSION #define cSITES_BASEVERSION #define cAPPS_BASEVERSION static const ULONG aiAppPoolColumns [] = {  iAPPPOOL_NAME,  iAPPPOOL_PERIODIC_RESTART_TIME, iAPPPOOL_PERIODIC_RESTART_REQUESTS, iAPPPOOL_MAXPROCESSES, iAPPPOOL_PINGING, iAPPPOOL_IDLETIMEOUT, iAPPPOOL_RAPIDFAIL_PROTECTION static const ULONG cAppPoolColumns = sizeof (aiAppPoolColumns) / sizeof (ULONG); static const ULONG cmaxAppPoolColumns = iAPPPOOL_RAPIDFAIL_PROTECTION + 1; static const ULONG aiSiteColumns [] = {  iSITE_ID,  iSITE_BINDINGS static const ULONG cSiteColumns = sizeof (aiSiteColumns) / sizeof (ULONG); static const ULONG cmaxSiteColumns = iSITE_BINDINGS + 1; static const ULONG aiAppColumns [] = {  iAPP_SITE,  iAPP_APPPOOL, iAPP_URL static const ULONG cAppColumns = sizeof (aiAppColumns) / sizeof (ULONG); static const ULONG cmaxAppColumns = iAPP_URL + 1; CComPtr<ISimpleTableDispenser2> pISTDisp; ULONG cBaseVersion; ULONG HRESULT CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTAppPools; void* apvAppPoolValues [cmaxApppoolColumns]; WCHAR* wszAppPoolName; APP_POOL_CONFIG AppPoolConfig; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTSites; void* apvSiteValues [cmaxSiteColumns]; ULONG* acbSiteValues [cmaxSiteColumns]; CComPtr<ISimpleTableRead2> pISTApps; void* apvAppValues [cmaxAppColumns]; hr = GetSimpleTableDispenser (ePRODUCT_URT, fST_LOS_READONLY, &pISTDisp); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( didURTGLOBAL, tidAPPPOOLS,  0, 0, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, fST_LOS_COOK, (void**) &pISTAppPools #ifdef _DEBUG hr = pISTAppPools->GetTableMeta (&cBaseVersion, NULL, NULL, NULL); if (cAPPPOOLS_BASEVERSION != cBaseVersion) return E_UNEXPECTED; #endif // _DEBUG for (i = 0;; i++) hr = pISTAppPools->MoveToRowByIndex (i); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS == hr) break; hr = pISTAppPools->GetColumnValues (cAppPoolColumns, aiAppPoolColumns, NULL, apvAppPoolValues); wszAppPoolName = (WCHAR*) apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_NAME]; AppPoolConfig.PeriodicProcessRestartPeriodInMinutes = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_PERIODIC_RESTART_TIME])); AppPoolConfig. PeriodicProcessRestartRequestCount = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_PERIODIC_RESTART_REQUESTS])); AppPoolConfig.MaxSteadyStateProcessCount = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_MAXPROCESSES])); AppPoolConfig.PingingEnabled = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_PINGING])); AppPoolConfig.IdleTimeoutInMinutes = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_IDLETIMEOUT])); AppPoolConfig.RapidFailProtectionEnabled = ((ULONG)*(apvAppPoolValues[iAPPPOOL_RAPIDFAIL_PROTECTION])); hr = GetWebAdminService()->GetUlAndWorkerManager()->CreateAppPool (wszAppPoolName, &AppPoolConfig); hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( didURTGLOBAL, tidSITES,  0, 0, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, fST_LOS_COOK, (void**) &pISTSites #ifdef _DEBUG hr = pISTSites->GetTableMeta (&cBaseVersion, NULL, NULL, NULL); if (cSITES_BASEVERSION != cBaseVersion) return E_UNEXPECTED; #endif // _DEBUG for (i = 0;; i++) hr = pISTSites->MoveToRowByIndex (i); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS == hr) break; hr = pISTSites->GetColumnValues (cSiteColumns, aiSiteColumns, acbSiteValues, apvSiteValues); hr = GetWebAdminService()->GetUlAndWorkerManager()->CreateAppPool ( ((ULONG)*(apvSiteValues[iSITE_ID])), (BYTE*) apvSiteValues[iSITE_BINDINGS], acbSiteValues [iSITE_BINDINGS] hr = pISTDisp->GetTable ( didURTGLOBAL, tidAPPS,  0, 0, eST_QUERYFORMAT_CELLS, 0, (void**) &pISTApps #ifdef _DEBUG hr = pISTApps->GetTableMeta (&cBaseVersion, NULL, NULL, NULL); if (cAPPS_BASEVERSION != cBaseVersion) return E_UNEXPECTED; #endif // _DEBUG for (i = 0;; i++) hr = pISTApps->MoveToRowByIndex (i); if (E_ST_NOMOREROWS == hr) break; hr = pISTApps->GetColumnValues (cAppColumns, aiAppColumns, NULL, apvAppValues); hr = GetWebAdminService()->GetUlAndWorkerManager()->CreateApplication ( ((DWORD)*(apvAppValues[iAPP_SITE])), (WCHAR*) apvAppValues[iAPP_URL], (WCHAR*) apvAppValues[iAPP_APPPOOL] Here is a brief description of what the code snippet above does.  First note that 3 simple tables are used: the sites, apppools, and apps tables.  No query is specified in GetTable for any of the tables, meaning that all sites, all app pools, and all apps respectively are retrieved. For each table, the expected base version is verified in debug builds using GetTableMeta.  This is required to insure none of the expected columns were re-ordered or removed. For each table, we navigate to each row (ie: each app pool, site, or app) with MoveToRowByIndex.  For each row, we retrieve all column values of interest with GetColumnValues.  Values of interest are appropriate cast or copied, and the configuration for each row is passed into the ul-and-worker manager. The Cook-Down Process (a.k.a. Under the Covers) So far as the configuration manager is concerned, all sites, app pools, and apps are extracted from the persisted cooked cache via simple tables.  What happens under the covers though?  Basically, when the cooked cache is read, we want allow for the opportunity to re-cook the cache if the configuration changed.  All the configuration manager does to indicate this behavior is specify the fST_LOS_COOK level-of-service.  The cook-down magic occurs in the table s implementation dispenser, which is invoked during the binding process within the GetTable calls. In general, if the text-based configuration has not changed, the configuration is simply served directly from the cooked cache.  Here is the algorithm used: If fST_LOS_COOK is not provided, just fetch the configuration from the cooked cache.  Otherwise: If the cooked cache does not exist (ie: either this is a clean product installation or it was deleted), cook the configuration from the database-of-record into version 1 of the cooked cache and store the date-time stamp of the database-of-record, then serve up the configuration from the cooked cache.  Otherwise: Check the database-of-record against the date-time stamp in the cooked cache, and if it changed, begin a new cookdown process into a new version of the cooked cache: If the cookdown succeeds, eliminate the old cache, and serve up the configuration from the new cache, again recording the date-time stamp. If the cookdown fails catastrophically, discard the new cache, update the date-time stamp in the old cache, and serve up the configuration from the old cache. Otherwise, if the date-time stamp is still current, simply serve up the information from the persisted cache. During the cookdown, rich validation of the configuration occurs, as well as any necessary transformations and expansions.  Problems with the configuration for individual sites, app pools, or apps are logged in detail.  If the problem is severe enough, the particular site, app pool, or app does not get cooked and therefore does not appear at runtime.  Only for catastrophic problems is the cookdown abandoned entirely. The XML-based Configuration Files (a.k.a. Show Me The Text!) Here are snippets of the relevant configuration files.  Note that properties which are optional and which were omitted are properly defaulted. Sites configuration (from one or more *.sites files located at the well-known root): <SitesConfiguration xmlns="x-schema:SitesConfiguration.Schema"> <SiteConfiguration Name= MySite PathRoot= c:\mysite <Binding Sting= </SiteConfiguration> </SitesConfiguration> Application pools configuration (from one *.apppools file located at the well-known root): <ApplicationPoolsConfiguration xmlns="x-schema:ApplicationPoolsConfiguration.Schema"> <ApplicationPoolConfiguration Name= MyPool RestartTime= MaxProcesses= Pinging= </ApplicationPoolsConfiguration> Application configuration (from multiple *.appcfg files distributed throughout the file system): <ApplicationsConfiguration xmlns="x-schema:ApplicationsConfiguration.Schema"> <ApplicationConfiguration Name= MyApp ApplicationPool= MyPool </ApplicationsConfiguration> Sites configuration can be kept in 1 to n files, where n is the number of sites.  Any .sites file can have one or more sites configurations.  One factor in the decision of how few or how many .sites files to have is security.  (For example, assume 10 sites.  If each were owned by a different person/group, each site configuration should be in its own file so that it can be secured such that only the owner(s) and system administrator can change it.  If the same group owned 7 sites, the configuration for those 7 sites could all be in one file.) <todo/> Discuss security of XML files and CLB Validation Rules And Transformation Logic (a.k.a. !!!) <todo/> PAGE   PAGE   ~vnfc`Z }ztqnkheb_\YV

Goals This document tries to  Provide an overview for users of the December release of what needs to be configured where. Identify potential for unification Current files/layout Machine-level configuration files %windir%\admin.cfg: Fusion assembly version policy %windir%\xspdt\global.xml: Ducttape/WebServer. Directory is really install location of catalog.dll %windir%\System.messaging.cfg: Messaging %windir%\xspdt\.webconfig: XSP. Directory is really the install location of system.ASP.dll ?\op.clb: OP. Binary file, edited through WONS APIs and /or NSADMIN.EXE tool. %windir%\system32\security.cfg: Lightning code access security policy Per-user configuration files %USERPROFILE%\security.cfg: Lightning code access security policy Per-application configuration files <appdomain root dir>\app.cfg: Fusion assembly version policy <appdomain root dir>\appcfg.xml: Ducttape application configuration <appdomain root dir>\.dirconfig: XSP application/directory configuration Per-directory configuration files <appdomain root dir>\<relative URL>\.dirconfig: XSP directory configuration Per endpoint configuration files <app root dir>\<relative URL>\<filename>.mms: messaging endpoint configuration. File may or may not physically exist. Per-assembly <assembly root dir>\<assembly name>.cfg: Managed properties Suggested layout Still need final word on setup locations. Machine-level configuration files All machine-level configuration files reside under the URT installation directory in a  Config  sub-directory. Tentative default installation for URT: %windir%\COMPlus. The machine configuration directory would thus be %windir%\COMPlus\Config, unless overridden by the user. Hereafter we refer to this directory using <machineconfigdir>.  Managed code should obtain this location by calling System.Configuration.ConfigManager.GetMachineConfigDirectory (in MngdIst.dll), rather than hardcoding any paths. Unmanaged code should call the GetMachineConfigDirectory API (catalog.h header, link to cat.lib). <machineconfigdir>\machine.cfg:  Fusion assembly version policy Ducttape/WebServer configuration. XSP configuration when running under Ducttape. Example of a machine configuration file: <?xml version="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:catalog.xms">   <AppPoolList>     <AppPool AppPoolID="AppPool32"               PeriodicRestartTime="211" PeriodicRestartRequests="212" MaxProcesses="213"              PingingEnabled="214" IdleTimeout="115" RapidFailProtection="216"/>   </AppPoolList>   <SiteList>     <Site SiteID="304" DefaultAppPoolID="AppPool32"           HomeDirectory="%systemroot%\xspdt_invalid">       <BindingList>         <Binding Name="URLPre34"/>       </BindingList>     </Site>   </SiteList>   <webconfig xmlns=     <!-- xmlns=  only needed when xmlns is specified in <configuration> root element --> <!-- XSP configuration -->   </webconfig>   <BindingPolicy>     <BindingRedir Name="wininet" PK="" Version="0.5.0.10" VersionNew="0.7.0.1"                   NoPublisherPolicy="no"/>   </BindingPolicy> </configuration> <machineconfigdir>\web.cfg: XSP configuration, when running under IIS. <machineconfigdir>\System.messaging.cfg: Messaging configuration <machineconfigdir>\security.cfg: Lightning code access security policy ?\COMPlus\op.clb: OP. Binary file, edited through WONS APIs and /or NSADMIN.EXE tool. Per-user configuration files %USERPROFILE%\Config.cfg: Lightning code access security policy Per-application configuration files <appdomain root dir> is the Application Home directory defined in the Application Domain. All teams use the same semantics. <appdomain root dir>\Config.cfg:  Fusion assembly version policy Ducttape application configuration XSP app/dir configuration Example of an application configuration file ( config.cfg <?xml version ="1.0"?> <configuration xmlns="x-schema:Catalog.xms">   <webconfig xmlns=     <!-- xmlns=  only needed when xmlns is specified in <configuration> root element -->     <!-- XSP configuration goes here -->   </webconfig>   <Application     IsApp="TRUE"     AppEnabled="TRUE"/>   <BindingMode>     <AppBindingMode Mode="normal"/>   </BindingMode>   <BindingPolicy>     <BindingRedir Name="wininet" PK="" Version="0.5.0.10" VersionNew="0.6.0.0" NoPublisherPolicy="no"/>   </BindingPolicy>   <CodeBase>     <CodeBaseHint Name="wininet" PK="" Version="0.5.0.10" CodeBase="http://ie" />   </CodeBase> </configuration> Per-directory configuration files <appdomain root dir>\<relative URL>\Config.cfg: XSP directory configuration Per-endpoint configuration files <app root dir>\<relative URL>\<filename>.mms: messaging endpoint configuration. File may or may not physically exist. Per-assembly <assembly root dir>\<assembly name>.cfg: Managed properties Changes per team Configuration (MarkusH) Rename/move ducttape global configuration file to <machineconfigdir>\machine.cfg. Implement the System.Configuration.ConfigManager.GetMachineConfigDirectory method (to be checked in on 10/13, available in 10/14 config system build). Rename Ducttape app configuration file to  Config.cfg Change root node from  XMLDataStore configuration . Coordinate change with Fusion and Ducttape (default files) and OP (XML schema). Add <web> node under <configuration> node with open schema. Ducttape (EricDe) Rename global configuration file to  machine.cfg : prevent accidental download,  global  sounds like  enterprise global Move  machine.cfg  into <machineconfigdir>. Rename app configuration file to  Config.cfg : prevent accidental download. Change default files in build/setup. Coordinate content with other teams. Requires coordinated checkin with config team. XSP (GaryBu) Rename app/dir configuration file to  Config.cfg Read config from <Configuration> <web  ></web> <configuration/> node. Config team will change their schema to allow for an open <web> element.  Change default files in build/setup. Move machine config file into <machineconfigdir>. Lightning (StevenPr) Move machine security policy to <machineconfigdir>. Potentially: store machine policy in  machine.cfg  file (pending config team investigation, and design of storing serialized classes). Rename user security policy to  Config.cfg . Potentially: adjust format to be the same as machine.cfg format. Messaging (ChrisWhi) Move messaging machine configuration into <machineconfigdir>. Assembly Loader / Fusion (MarkusH/StevenPr) Rename Fusion application configuration file to  Config.cfg : shared with Ducttape, both using catalog => should  just work Move Fusion machine configuration file to <machineconfigdir>. Rename Fusion machine configuration file to  machine.cfg Need to coordinate contents of default files with other teams (if any). Setup Install default machine config file(s) into %windir%\COMPlus\Config directory. Write new registry keys for catalog DLL and machine config directory (per   HYPERLINK "http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/using urt config.htm"  http://appcenter/config/specs/urt1/using urt config.htm What is the default install location for COM+ 2.0 binaries? Assuming %windir%\COMPlus Needs final sign off from setup team. Open Issues In addition to the issues outlined throughout the document, the following items require further attention: Revision History October 6, 1999 Rev 0.1 (MarkusH): Created. October 8, 1999 Rev 0.2 (MarkusH): Added suggestions from config meeting. Added suggested file layout. Added required changes per-team with owners. October 12, 1999 Rev 0.3 (MarkusH): Resolved last issues. Changed per-app/directory files for  Config.cfg . Added GetMachineConfigDirectory API. Clarified <web> sub-node for XSP config. October 15, 1999 Rev 0.4 (MarkusH): Changed <web> to <webconfig> (on request from XSP). Clarified syntax for <webconfig> tag when using schema validation. Clarified use of web.cfg by XSP only when running under IIS. Added section for Setup changes. All teams (except Setup) have now signed off on this.  Microsoft Confidential Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

Introduction As all reasonably rich platforms, the Project 42/URT platform consists of a set of technologies that are designed and developed by independent teams, often on different schedules and usually with different backgrounds and scenarios in mind. In order to avoid the fragmentation of the current Windows 2000/WinDNA platform, it is necessary to coordinate the different technologies in terms of the programming model(s), as well as the administrative model. This document is concerned about the latter. Guiding Principles simplicity for the administrator, zero-administration for the end-user  zero registration, "XCOPY" deployment  text based configuration files, Notepad editable  uniform model across all URT features  uniform, simple (scriptable), remoteable configuration API (read/write)  application isolation: make applications discoverable and replicatable ("XCOPY *.* /s") Scenarios Need to drive app model(s) to closure! -> MaryKir Web Application ( Parcel Delivery  aka FedEx) A web application has a single application configuration file that always resides in the root directory of the web application. URL Namespace File System  HYPERLINK "http://updserver"  http://updserver C:\wwwroot\updserver Updserver.cfg /Tracking \Tracking Tracking.XSP Tracking.XSP /Order \Order Order.XSP Order.XSP Order_Template.HTML Order.DLL Tracking.DLL Standalone Client App ( The assumption in this document is that a single application configuration file is deployed in the same directory as the EXE and the configuration file name can be derived from the EXE file name (i.e.  foo.exe.cfg Browser Object Remoting/Messaging Client to Server Server to Server Cross-Process ( ActiveX EXE Requirements Support replication Can shared assemblies be exported/redistributed out of the assembly cache? Support  XCOPY  deployment (aka zero-registration) Support secure, application-local storage of sensitive information (passwords etc.). The meta-data interface must accommodate changes to the meta-data schema without requiring a recompile of catalog infrastructure, runtime interfaces, admin interfaces or consumers. The runtime interfaces must be easy/efficient to use for common usage scenarios, i.e. not requiring multiple requests and negotiations/discovery steps for activation. Extensibility for URT Context properties and their attributes  Third party extensibility (app specific settings) Third party extensibility for infrastructure (?) Is this a requirement for URT? URT 1.0 Administrative Framework The URT 1.0 Administrative Framework is built around three top-level concepts: Attribute: a named value, potentially arbitrarily complex. Entity: an entity to which one or more attributes can be applied. Container: a physical location at which attributes are stored. Attribute Containers Attribute containers represent the different physical locations in which attributes are actually stored. The URT 1.0 Administrative Framework distinguishes between different attribute containers. Are there other containers? Per-user? Policy per assembly cache? Machine Configuration Some attributes can be specified for all application on a machine. Some of these attributes provide default values in case an application does not specify a value. Other attributes configure entities that exist only once per machine. Machine level attributes should be avoided whenever possible, because as soon as two application require different values for a machine level attribute, customers are forced to use two separate machines. Site Definition IIS / Ducttape have the concept of a site, that establishes a root URL to use for a set of file system directories and applications. In a typical administrative scenario, a machine administrator (example:  ) creates one or more sites for use by site/application administrators. The machine administrator often wants to specify certain attributes (ex. Bandwidth throttling) that the site/app administrator cannot modify. This needs more discussion with Ducttape / XSP. Site Configuration The Site Config file provides a clean way for the site/application administrator to specify site level attributes, without having access to the machine wide  site directory  and the site definition file. Application Configuration An application in the most general form is defined as the collection of code and it s data running in a URT Application Domain. Hosting environments like XSP, Browsers and the Win32 EXE  Loader  establish application scope by creating an application domain. In many scenarios, a root assembly and all its dependencies do not fully define an application. In XSP/scripting scenarios for example, a script is dynamically compiled and executed without ever formally being authored as an assembly. Every application domain has exactly one configuration file that carries all the configurable attributes for any assemblies that might get loaded into the application domain. The configuration file location is determined at application domain creation time as an explicit parameter to the application domain creation API. Need to get this into the appdomain API! The configuration file is an XML file that can be freely edited using arbitrary tools (including text editors like NotePad). Is there really a one-to-one relationship to Application/Application Domain? Can we provide programmatic control over app configuration to the app domain creator? Through general purpose APIs? In certain dynamic hosting scenarios (Scripting etc.) assemblies are created in memory and on the fly. It wouldn t make sense to force a temporary config file for these cases Is this a separate file from the fusion settings file and the WFC Managed Properties files? How does the configuration file get created? How does the configuration file get updated when new assemblies are copied into the  Application ? In most scenarios updates to the config file should not be required unless the new assembly needs to be configured! How do we secure the configuration file? Signing? File system security? Most scenarios can not require signing of the config file Application Definition Do we need the concept of an application definition that captures the immutable aspects of an app? Is this just a regular assembly (manifest) that is marked (or even implicitly treated) as the root of an application (domain)? It must be possible to add assemblies to an app without explicitly adding them to neither app definition nor app config file! How does an application tie into the assembly cache dependency tracking/refcounting? Directory In web scenarios, certain attributes can be specified to apply to all files in a directory. The directory container holds these attributes. Do we need dedicated physical containers for directories or are directory attributes specified in the application container? Where do file attributes get specified? NTFS file streams have been proposed as one mechanism Are directories always scoped within an application?  Assembly Assemblies group one or more modules into a single logical unit. Every module must be in an assembly as the names of all entities in a module are scoped by the name of the assembly. Assemblies and assembly attributes are generated by development tools and cannot be configured. However, many assembly attributes are merged with and validated against configuration information of the hosting application domain. In URT 1.0, assembly meta-data is stored in a Component Library ( Assembly Manifest ). The Component Library can be stored inside a Win32 PE image or left as a stand-alone file. More details on   HYPERLINK "http://lightning/Specs/admin/Default.htm"  http://lightning/Specs/admin/Default.htm It has been agreed that there are no assembly level configuration files. However, some documents still talk about these Module Attributes can be stored within the module that carries the attributed entities. Modules and module attributes are generated by development tools. Again, module attributes cannot be configured, but do get merged with and validated against configuration information. In URT 1.0, module meta-data is stored in a Component Library inside a PE image. More details on   HYPERLINK "http://lightning/Specs/Formats/default.htm"  http://lightning/Specs/Formats/default.htm Attributed Entities Attributes apply to one or more entities, whose semantics they modify. This section lists the logical entities that can be attributed in Project 42. Are there more entities? Need to add detail for each entity. Each logical entity corresponds to a logical tables (in some case more than one) in the catalog. The attributes associated with each entity correspond to the columns in this table. The actual rows in the table are typically the result of a merge of the attributes as specified in one or more physical containers. Section   REF _Ref456167495 \r \h   talks more about container relationships and merge semantics. Machine Virtual Site Application Pool Application Assembly Directory Virtual Directory Page / File Module Always scoped within an assembly. Class Always scoped within an assembly. Interface Interface Definition Scoped within an assembly. Interface Implementation Scoped within a class. Method Method Definition Scoped within an interface definition. Method Implementation Scoped within a class or an interface implementation. Container Relationships The merge follows specific semantics, which often depend on the attribute itself, the container that it is specified in or the way it is specified. The catalog provides a set of common merge semantics, which can be selected declaratively at different levels (global schema, in the configuration file itself, in a parent configuration file). The catalog infrastructure is also extensible using multiple mechanisms (custom virtual tables, table interceptors etc.). These mechanisms can be used to implement arbitrary merge semantics. Do we need to provide third-party extensibility for merge semantics in URT V1? Do we need to generalize containment relationships? Do we need to generalize inheritance between containers? Containment Machine Config contains  Site Config Site Config contains Application Config Application Config contains Application Definition (may be implicit) Application Definition contains Assembly Assembly contains  Module Inheritance and Override Rules Along the containment hierarchy of the different containers, some attributes can be inherited from parent to child while others can be inherited from child to parent. Inheritable attributes can be marked as  Final: Containers that are lower in the inheritance graph cannot modify the attribute. Overridable: Containers that are lower in the inheritance graph can freely override the attribute; effectively the attribute represents a default value. Constrainable: Containers that are lower in the inheritance graph can only constrain the attribute. Example: Bandwidth throttling specified at the site level can only be reduced at the application level. Do we unify Fusion  inheritance  with IIS/Ducttape inheritance? Likely not, but how do we rationalize this for the dev/admin? XSP proposes an attribute merging mechanism similar to the Apache Module mechanism. Implementing the Framework: Catalog In order to ensure a common approach to configuration, all URT features will consume any configurable attributes through a common configuration infrastructure, the URT Catalog. Configuration APIs Configuration files can obviously be created through arbitrary means, as they are text files and their format is fully documented. In addition, the URT Catalog provides higher-level configuration APIs that allow read/write access to configuration files and other storage containers. The Configuration APIs are designed for use by administrative tools. They will be broadly documented ( Platform SDK ). The AS 2.0 Administrative Tools are written exclusively to the configuration APIs. All attributes will be exposed through a single set of APIs. The catalog team owns defining and implementing this API.  The configuration APIs allow queries and enumeration over all configuration data. They also provide validated write access to configuration data. The configuration APIs also allow secure remote access to configuration data. The configuration API is exposed as a set of managed classes. Refer to   HYPERLINK "http://appsrv/asconfig/specs/urt1/AppServerConfigRequirements.doc"  http://appsrv/asconfig/specs/urt1/AppServerConfigRequirements.doc  for more details. The configuration API builds on the lower level configuration system, which is why all URT configuration must be exposed through the catalog infrastructure. Binaries also carry fixed meta-data, which is provided by the developer (and the development tools). Development tools use low-level meta-data creation APIs when generating modules and assemblies. The meta-data creation APIs will be publicly documented, but probably in a limited fashion  ( tools developer SDK ). The runtime team owns the module and assembly meta-data creation APIs (IMetaDataEmit*, see   HYPERLINK "http://lightning/Specs/Formats/default.htm"  http://lightning/Specs/Formats/default.htm  for details). Storage Abstraction: Simple Tables and Table Dispensers The URT Catalog is built around a relational database abstraction. All configuration information is broken into a set of tables.  For details refer to the implementation spec at   HYPERLINK "http://appsrv/asconfig/specs/urt1/simpletablesV2.doc"  http://appsrv/asconfig/specs/urt1/simpletablesV2.doc Table Schema All tables are described with rich schema information. In addition to standard table/column/type information, the schema carries other information, including hints to the (generic) configuration APIs, such as allowable values for an attribute, enumerations, relations between tables etc. Every table has a unique name (a Table ID). Table Dispenser / Wiring Database The table dispenser maps queries to a specific COM component (hereafter called a table implementation) that will render the contents of the table as described in the schema, in whatever way it sees fit. The mapping mechanism is fully customizable using custom table dispensers, and can consider: The table ID being requested. The query being passed in. The level of service (read-only, read-write, remote etc.) being requested. Any arbitrary criteria the custom table dispenser sees fit. For a given table, multiple implementations may exist; for example if a client requests read-only access, an in-process implementation may be chosen, while for write access a transactional implementation running in a protected system process may be chosen. The standard table dispenser allows selection of table implementations based on table ID and level of service. It uses the wiring database to map TableID/Level of Service to specific table implementations. Data Tables Some table implementations are physical tables, i.e. they are immediately backed by some persistent store and perform only minimal - mainly syntactic - validation of the data.  The catalog team provides a set of data table implementations, which include  XML data table CompLib data table RegDB data table Data tables under consideration are: IIS meta base data table Registry data table Internal URT teams can write their own data tables and plug them into the catalog framework using the catalog s wiring database. Logic Tables Other table implementations do not serve data with a direct physical representation but are merely logical tables (also called virtual tables): they are created as the result of applying some form of custom logic to one or more physical tables. Like data tables, logic tables are also implemented as COM components. Examples of such custom logic are:  Joins of hard-coded attributes (class meta-data) with configuration information into a single  Class  table.  Merges of configuration attributes along a containment hierarchy.  Calculation of internally required information based on a set of publicly exposed attributes. Validation of semantic consistency of attributes. Internal URT teams can write their own logic tables and combine them with data tables or other logic tables in a generic way using the catalog s wiring database, or in a completely customized way. A key goal of the catalog architecture is to keep the configuration logic separate from the consuming (system runtime) code, in order to Allow the config APIs and the UI to be driven of the same logic as the system, Enable the system to adapt to changes in the configuration logic by changing a well-isolated body of code, Enable the system to adapt to changes in the underlying store. Runtime APIs The system runtimes that consume configuration information will typically want to transform the relational data into specific, in-memory representations, that are optimized for a specific usage pattern. Often, consumers will want to cache this in-memory representation for the lifetime of a process. Currently, it is up to each consumer to build their runtime API set on top of the catalog s table abstraction and implement their own in-memory caching (if needed). Who writes the runtime interfaces for each of the consumers? Each consumer? The app server admin team? What pieces (caching, persistence of preprocessed attributes) are common across all runtime interfaces and should be provided by the catalog team? In URT 1.0, the catalog - including all data and logic tables - is implemented in unmanaged code. However, the table dispenser and table access interfaces are exposed as a set of managed code interfaces. Logic table implementers can of course invoke managed code if required. Attributes In order to further facilitate synergy between the different users of catalog technology, this section tracks the high-level config and attributes requirements for each of the URT teams. This section focuses on configurable attributes, but includes development time attributes whenever those need to be merged with or validated against configurable attributes.

Scenario #1 is: Specify all site, app pool, and app information consumed by the config manager in XML. The config manager code is revised to fetch all information from simple tables, which always pulls from a persisted cache. Under the covers... The first time the server is started, the XML config is validated and cooked into a persisted cache (CLB1) which also retains a date/time stamp of the XML file. The second time the server is started, provided the XML is not changed (according to the date/time stamp), the config comes from the persisted cache. The third time it starts, assuming the XML has changed, the XML is cooked again into CLB2.  Assuming validation succeeds, CLB1 is removed. The fourth time, assume the XML config for a particular site is hosed.  During the validation process, appropriate logging occurs, and the cookdown process succeeds, producing CLB3, which is however missing the hosed site.  (Do we keep CLB2?) The fifth time, the XML config is totally hosed.  During the validation process, since cooking CLB4 fails, CLB4 goes away, and the config is served up from CLB3. [Seth Pollack]  should log an event in this case. Schedule and dates to be established for scenario #2 and #3.  Scenario #2 will involve adding an app by copying its files into the directory tree.  Scenario #3 will involve change notification while the system is up and running on a per site and apppool basis. [Seth Pollack]  or per app. Scenario 2: Application Config Do we require that all UL configuration be read in at UL startup time? Are there mechanisms for on-demand reading? How do we do (incremental) updates to configuration? What are the performance/scalability implications (incremental runtime hits vs. cost of pre-calc)? What are the implications of allowing on-disk and in-use/cooked down configurations to be out of sync? Replication (does replication fail? Use the cooked down config? The potentially flaky on-disk config?), PSS (troubleshooting implications). Ducttape/XSP configuration file structure Global configuration All machine-wide configuration information is stored in a single, well-known directory location (i.e.  c:\inetpub Global Policy The global configuration file ( c:\inetpub\global.cfg ) defines the default policy for all sites and all applications, directories and files on a machine. Site Definition A set of site definition files ( c:\inetpub\*.sitedef ) define the virtual sites on a machine.  Each site definition file establishes one or more virtual sites ( server binding , root directory), defines the name of the site configuration file if any, defines global policy for all apps, directories and files in the site. The site definition file can limit the set of applications in the site by listing the locations in which application configuration files can be stored. The locations are specified in the form of a search path; each part of the search path can be  A relative path to a specific application configuration file. A relative path to a directory under which to search for application configuration files. The site definition file can limit the set of virtual directory configuration files by listing the locations in which vdir configuration files can be stored. The locations are specified in the form of a search path, that follows the same rules as the application search path. Site Configuration A site can have a site configuration file ( c:\inetpub\wwwroot\mysite\mysite.sitecfg ), which allows the machine administrator to delegate some of the site configuration to a separate site administrator. There can be at most one site configuration file for a site; it must reside in the site s root directory and the site configuration file name must be explicitly specified in the site definition file.  The site configuration file configures a site within the limits of the global policy and the site definition. The site configuration file can specify and refine the policy for all apps/dirs/files in the site. The site configuration file can refine the application and vdir search paths specified in the site definition file. Application Configuration Each application has exactly one application configuration file ( c:\inetpub\wwwroot\mysite\myapp\myapp.appcfg , or  c:\inetpub\wwwroot\mysite\mysite.appcfg ). A directory can have at most one application configuration file. Unless the site definition or site configuration file s application search path indicates a path to a specific application configuration file, the application configuration file must have the same root name as the directory in which it resides and must carry the .appcfg file extension. This avoids problems introduced by maliciously or carelessly adding arbitrary files with a  .appcfg  file extension to a directory. The application configuration file establishes the scope of an application within both the UNC and URL name spaces. The location of the application configuration file determines the root URL/UNC path for the application. URL/UNC paths that share a common prefix with the root URL/UNC path of the application, and do not share a longer common prefix with any other application s URL/UNC path are said to be within the scope of the application. The application configuration file provides configuration for an application within the policy defined by the global, site definition and site configuration files (if any). An application does NOT inherit any settings from any application configuration files that reside in a parent directory outside of the scope of the application. All items (DLLs, scripts etc.) that reside in a directory within the scope of an application do inherit the application configuration from the application configuration file in the root of the application. The application configuration file specifies the location(s) in which the URT searches for privately installed assemblies. The location(s) for private assemblies are specified in the form of a search path; each part of the search path can be  A relative path to a directory under which to search for assemblies. The relative path must point to a directory within the scope of the application. An absolute path to a directory under which to search for assemblies. To avoid fragility introduced by search path order, only the first directory in the search path may contain assemblies with simple names. Virtual Directory Configuration *.vdircfg   establishes exactly one virtual directory. More than one per directory. By default, file name is used as the relative URL for the vdir, can be overridden in the .vdircfg file. Directory and File Configuration .dircfg   configures a directory. One per directory. Can exclude sub-directories from URL namespace. Can exclude individual files from URL namespace. Can mention specific .dircfg files in sub-directories. Can specify file config for individual files or groups of files (wildcard). .filecfg   configures one file. For each file, <file>.<ext>.filecfg is used first Processing the Configuration Files GaryBu proposes to do directive based processing rather than declarative/relational merging. The information contained in the configuration files is parsed into a set of logical tables: Global Sites Applications Virtual Directories Directories Files The Global table is a direct representation of the global configuration file. The Sites table is computed as a merge of the following files: Global Site Definition Site Configuration The Applications table is computed as a merge of the following files: Global Site Definition Site Configuration Application Configuration The Virtual Directories table is computed as a merge of the following files: Global Site Definition Site Configuration Virtual Directory Configuration (recursion here) The Directories table is computed as a merge of the following files: Global Site Definition Site Configuration Directory Configuration (recursion here) The Files table is computed as a merge of the following files: Global Site Definition Site Configuration Directory Configuration (recursion here) File Configuration Each configuration file indicates the context for each attribute (= into which of the logical tables the attribute should be merged). Using XML this could be expressed by defining an additional table (call them  config file tables ) corresponding to each of the logical tables, and scoping the attributes within these tables. Controlling the merging process This part is currently under design/discussion, together with the directives based config proposal. The merging process can be further controlled via additional tags on individual attributes.  Each attribute can be tagged using one of the following options: Final : differing values in subsequent configuration files are ignored (warning logged). This is the default. Specializable : subsequent configuration files can only specify values that further specialize this value (Examples: MaxBandwidth at the site def level, can be reduced, but not expanded at the site config level). Overrideable : subsequent configuration files can completely replace this value. : this attribute should be added to a multi-value attribute. Remove : this attribute should be removed from a multi-value attribute. Custom_Merge : a URT class (or a catalog logic table) is invoked to perform the merge. The name of the class is specified in the tag. Aliases for commonly used classes can be declared in any configuration file. Input to the class is the set of logical tables as parsed so far and the configuration file to be merged into them. Output is a new set of logical tables. In XML these tags could be expressed as additional, optional columns in the config file tables, using the attribute name as a root name and appending  _merge , i.e.  We need a better way to express tags in XML. <site MaxBandWidth=1000 MaxBandWidth_merge= final <file  ScriptMap= ScriptMap_merge= Remove In SiteCfg: <application MyDSN= server=\\mysql;uid=xyz;pwd=blah MyDSN_merge= myassembly#DSNMerge In AppCfg: <application MyDSN= database=Customer MyDSN_merge= myassembly#DSNMerge Result: MyDSN= server=\\mysql;database=Customer;database=Customer;uid=xyz;pwd=blah Based on preliminary info from ScottGu.

These are likely candidates for an (immutable, signed) application definition file. We d need some rudimentary mechanism to disallow usage of the assemblies (or XSP files?) in such an app without a proper app definition file. It probably doesn t have to be bullet proof (see COM/ActiveX Control licensing mechanism: proof of intent is sufficient).

It must be possible to override (some) developer specified attributes in the app config file. Which attributes must be overridable? It must be possible to enforce override rules between developer specified attributes and configured attributes. It must be possible to validate consistency between different context attributes (i.e. tx and sync etc.). What are these rules/validations? Who codes them? Channels It must be possible to enumerate all the channels/endpoints on which to listen for a given machine It must be possible to select certain channels as part of the application configuration. It must be possible to specify endpoints for preinstalled channels as part of the application configuration (per app). It must be possible to configure channels/endpoints at the machine level (policy: turn of all HTTP channels). It must be possible to add new channels as part of an application or on a machine wide basis. A Component Category-style approach is being proposed, but this mechanism doesn t allow specifying parameters (endpoints etc.). Can this be another  binding  in the .global or .site file? If we use the  cookdown  mechanism for channel/context config, what are the performance requirements? Do we need an additional layer of caching or can the  regdb cache  be used directly?

(LorenK) COM+ 1.0 Role-based Security This section expresses the COM+ 1.0 role-based security attributes in the URT 1.0 administrative framework. It is merely meant to be an illustration of attribute usage for those familiar with COM+ 1.0 role-based security.

String + Collection of Roles Application Assembly (?) Config Security Enabled Application Class Config Role-base Security required Assembly Assembly Role Definition Roles are a development time abstraction for security principals. At deployment time, roles are associated with real security principals, like Windows NT user accounts or user groups. Roles are defined at development time. Their visibility is scoped by an application (domain). Roles are named by the developer using simple, unstructured strings. At deployment time and runtime, role names are disambiguated using the assembly identity that defined the role string. Roles can only be defined through Role Access and Role Reference attributes in a module. Roles can only be associated with classes, interfaces or methods through Role Access attributes in a module. Do we need a mechanism to enable role definition/assignment at the assembly or configuration level? Role Access This attributes indicates that the system is to allow access to a class, interface or method to members of a specified role. Multiple roles can be granted access to a particular class, interface or method. Role permissions are cumulative:  If a role is granted access to a class, members of this role can access all methods in this class.  If a role is granted access to an interface, members of this role can access all methods in this interface. Do we need to worry about fields and statics? Assumption: fields   yes, statics   no. Likely depends on remoteability of fields/statics. Role Access attributes can only be specified at the module level (= module compilation time!). Role Reference This attribute indicates that the implementation of a class performs programmatic checks if the current caller is a member of one or more specific roles. The class will typically behave differently depending on the role membership of the caller. Role References can only be applied to classes, not individual interfaces or methods. Expressing a role membership does not automatically grant access role members access to the class; this must be done through an additional Role Access attribute. Role Reference attributes can only be specified at the module level (= module compilation time!). Role Alias (?) A Role Alias combines one or more developer-defined roles into a single role for administrative purposes. Role Aliases   just a like Role Definitions   are scoped by an application (domain). A developer-defined role can be a member of at most one Role Alias.  If a developer-defined role is a member of a role alias, no role membership can be defined for the developer-defined role; the system treats all members of the role alias as members of the developer-defined role. Do we really want/need this mechanism? Role Membership The Role Membership attribute maps one or more security principals (example: NT user accounts or groups) to a Role Definition or a Role Alias. Role Membership attributes can only be specified in the Application Configuration (= Application Domain). Component Categories? A mechanism to categorize assemblies/classes is being defined. Should this be available through config APIs/catalog?

Activation Key concepts:  Level objects Level object Properties (= interceptors) Activators Activation Messages A hierarchy of level objects needs to be established. For each level object, the set of properties must be determined:  the set of properties is established dynamically, based on specific activation requests.  It is interesting to specify a fixed set of properties.  Each property can have it s own set of configurable parameter (Property bag? String?). For each level object, the set of activators must be determined: The set of activators is established dynamically, based on specific activation requests. One of the activators is special and handles the  FindOrCreate  functionality for the level. How does the runtime determine if a class should be  activated  vs. just created (remoteable flag in assembly meta-data?)?

Process Just-In-Time Activation (JITA) Waiting for JITA spec from WebObjects team. -> ShawnWoo/SatishT . It looks like there will be no JITA in URT 1.0. Just-in-Time Activation enables the system to do proactive state management for classes to which callers maintain long-lived references. In order to support JITA, a class must call state management functions (SetComplete, SetAbort) or use the Auto Done attribute to inform the system when any internal state an instance of a class might carry can be safely discarded ( the instance has become stateless Attribute Logical Entity Physical Container JIT Activation Enum (Supported, Not Supported, Not Specified) Class Module Auto Done Method Module JIT Activation Does the concept of a class  not supporting  JITA make sense? If the class never calls the state management APIs, it will still behave correctly Do we need a concept of  requiring JITA  (or better: requiring deletion) for cases where a class does not guarantee state cleanup if it is reused for the same or other callers?  Auto Done This method-level attribute indicates the system that upon return from a call to this method, the class instance can be considered stateless. The Auto Done attribute can only be specified in a module (= at compilation time). Object Pooling It looks like there will be no Object Pooling in URT 1.0. Object Pooling allows class instances to be reused for different callers. It is often used in conjunction with JIT Activation. A class that supports Object Pooling guarantees that any state that it maintains when being reused for a different caller is safe (i.e. does not leak confidential state like credit card numbers, does not violate the atomicity rule of transaction etc.).

This attributes indicates if a class can be used as part of a load-balancing cluster. In order to support load-balancing a class must not rely on any machine specific state between instance creations, and can not share any state with other classes in the same module, process or machine, which is not accessible to other instances of these classes.  Attribute Logical Entity Physical Container Load balancing Enum (Supported, Not supported, Not specified) Class Module Load balancing Enabled Machine Class Config Context Attribute Logical Entity Physical Container Must be activated in caller s context Class Module Distributed Messaging Bus Bricks vs. Activators Path, PathManager? Durable Channels? Server side In URT 1.0, messaging will exclusively use the universal listener (Ducttape) on the server side. Very likely the proposed Ducttape file structure will meet messaging requirements. Messaging endpoints map to URLs in the Ducttape world. How do XSP and Messaging relate? Are they layered? How does Ducttape choose one or the other if not? How does an admin/dev specify which one they want? Additional logical entities are: Endpoint (=URLs) Brick Path (of Bricks) How does the path relate to XSP pipeline and Remoting level objects?  Channel An initial bootstrap scenario (FedEx messaging demo) for messaging/catalog integration drives the following attributes: Need to incorporate more requirements, like message types and inheritance. Attribute Logical Entity Physical Container Channel Name String? Channel Durable Channel InboundPath Foreign key -> Path Channel OutboundPath Foreign key -> Path Channel SendToURL String Channel [SourceURL] String Channel Implicit Channel Timeout DWORD? Channel Message Timeout DWORD? Channel PathID QoS (aggregated) PathID URL? Machine?  PathName String? URL? Machine?  Quality of Service Flags? Strings? URL? Machine?  PathID Configured Brick URL? Machine?  BrickName Assembly/classref? Configured Brick URL? Machine?  BrickParameters Name/Value pairs? Configured Brick URL? Machine? Order DWORD? Configured Brick URL? Machine?  Quality of Service consists of multiple values that can be or d together. For each endpoint (URL), multiple QoS can be specified. Message Types: incoming and outgoing. In V1 likely just a collection of strings (URIs?). Path of Server Bricks: internal to the server! QoS is related to Brick path, but one cannot necessarily just be derived from the other. Some validation can be performed (i.e. declared QoS is actually supported by the brick path).  For ease of administration inheritance can be interesting (a requirement for Pub/Sub, see below). Securing which classes are allowed to run as bricks is interesting, although likely a V2 feature (we didn't discuss this, but Lescek mentioned it at the URTSec meeting). What is the scalability/performance requirement for channels? How many channels per machine? How often do durable channels get updated? => Scot Boyd Are transient channels stored through catalog mechanisms? Depends on performance requirements for V1. What store will be used for durable channels? RCraig. Depends on perf requirements for V1. Client side For the initial scenario the same server attributes seem to be sufficient. How do we attach paths/channels/endpoint config to client apps? EXEs? WebApps? Browser? Need to be able to discover endpoints and their (public) attributes. Likely via naming service. Unclear if endpoints need to be externally configurable on the client side. This is definitely a remoting requirement, but not currently a messaging requirement. URTMsg (DCole?) to follow up with the remoting team. Publish/Subscribe We briefly touched Pub/Sub, but didn't go into much detail. In V1, subscriptions will be stored on the server only (= broker always lives on the server). Subscription by URL prefix is a Pri 1 requirement (aka inherit subscriptions from parent URL nodes). IIS 5.0 Current plan for URT 1.0 seems to be that XSP must run on both IIS 5.0 and Ducttape/ universal listener. It may be necessary to map some of the ducttape/XSP config back into the metabase Application Roots? Virtual Directories? Fusion Settings (= Application specific configuration information). => HariKris Are we going to have both Fusion settings and managed properties in URT 1.0? -> HariKris (Fusion), StefanPh (WFC) Is there a single settings file per application? How does the settings file get created? Managed Properties Need to engage with Cdias/ StefanPh. WFC Managed Properties (  HYPERLINK "http://vs/documents/cdias/managedproperties.doc"  http://vs/documents/cdias/managedproperties.doc ) are a mechanism to store arbitrary configuration state for COM+ Classes.  Server WFC uses managed properties to store configuration for system elements like Queue Components. Should these be stored in the same XML file as the configuration file? Same as settings file? Do these participate in (persistent) caching of attributes? How do these related to Fusion settings? What is the admin UI for managed properties? Should the system configuration aspects of managed properties be changed to use the URT admin framework? Others? Others DataLink admin? -> LaraD/PatD XML Parser? Net Classes? Can we assume that COM+ 1.0 Admin will be used? IMDB? Can we assume that COM+ 1.0 Admin will be used?

May 19, 1999 Rev 0.2 (MarkusH): Added Attribute vs. Container vs. Entity matrix. Added more potential consumers. Added more details to container/entity/attribute terminology. May 24, 1999 Rev 0.3 (MarkusH): Added preliminary info about URT Security. May 27, 1999 Rev 0.4 (MarkusH): Added preliminary Ducttape attributes, including initial attribute set for M4 drop. Added Ducttape entities (app pool, virtual site, page). Added M4 scenario for Ducttape. Clarified COM+ 1.0 attributes used as examples. June 3, 1999 Rev 0.5 (MarkusH): Added preliminary XSP attributes. Added Site Config container. June 8, 1999 Rev 0.6 (MarkusH): Added preliminary notes on Ducttape/XSP site configuration. Incorporated feedback from XSP: clarified that HTML templates are optional; clarified that config manifest does not have to be signed; clarified that an assembly does not need to be  registered  in app config/definition in order to work; added ISV Licensing attributes.  July 13, 1999 Rev 0.7 (MarkusH): Added issue around in-use and actual config getting out of sync. Added info on context and channel config. Added info on messaging config. Updated XSP/Ducttape scenarios/issues. Fleshed out the introduction/framework/catalog sections. Added section about naming service. July 16, 1999 Rev 0.7a (MarkusH): Clarified that messaging is a top-level feature, not thought of as part of WebObjects. Page   PAGE   NUMPAGES

CODEWORK: Here are a number of things we need to do in WAS (and in IIS+
more generally in some cases) before ship:


Review all metabase settings we inherited from IIS5, to make sure we implement
them in IIS+ (or explicitly choose to punt). 

Rename everything (dlls, event source name, service name, etc.) to final 
product names.

Sync up iisutil sources to the final, shipping IIS5 sources from which they
were forked (has this already been done??).

Adjust all default configuration settings to the desired values for ship. This 
includes default values for settings read from the config store, but also values
for things that are hardwired in the code (low mem limits, etc.).

Review all strings that show to the customer, for example event log messages.

IIS World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service) Is Disabled During Upgrade

To protect your server from attacks by malicious users, the World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service) will be disabled during upgrade. Microsoft Windows 2000 Server installs Internet Information Services (IIS) by default, and requires administrators to secure IIS to prevent attacks.

The IIS Lockdown Tool has not been run on this Windows 2000 server. If you do not want to allow the WWW service to be disabled, you must download and run the IIS Lockdown Tool, or add the override registry key. Otherwise, you can continue with the upgrade and re-enable the WWW service after the upgrade has completed.

Important: If you use the World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service), we strongly recommend that you run the IIS Lockdown Tool before upgrading to a product in the Windows Server 2003 family. The IIS Lockdown Tool will help secure your computer by disabling or removing unnecessary features that are present in your Windows 2000 Server installation. These features would otherwise have remained on your machine after upgrading, leaving your server vulnerable to attacks. Using the IIS Lockdown Tool instead of using the override registry key or re-enabling the WWW service after installation allows you to fine-tune the level of security to your particular needs.

When upgrading to a member of the Windows Server 2003 family, the WWW service will NOT be disabled if any of the following conditions are present:

- You have already run the IIS Lockdown Tool on your Windows 2000 Server before starting the upgrade process. The IIS Lockdown Tool reduces surface attack by disabling unnecessary features, and it allows you to decide which features to enable for your site. The IIS Lockdown Tool is available at IIS Lockdown Tool (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8599). 
- The registry key RetainW3SVCStatus has been added to the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC. Under RetainW3SVCStatus you can add any value and then assign a DWORD value to it. For example, you can create the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\RetainW3SVCStatus\do_not_disable with the DWORD value of 1. 
- In the unattended install case, an entry "DisableWebServiceOnUpgrade = false" exists in the unattended install script.

After the upgrade is completed, you can enable the WWW service using either IIS Manager or the Services snap-in.

To start the WWW service after upgrade

In IIS Manager:

1. From the Start menu, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager. 
2. Expand the local computer, expand the Web Sites folder, right-click the Web site you want to start, and then click Start. 
3. Click Yes to enable the WWW service and start the Web site. 

In the Services snap-in:

1. From the Start menu, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Services. 
2. In the list of services, right-click World Wide Web Publishing Service, and then click Properties. 
3. On the General tab, in the Startup type list, click Automatic, and then click OK. 
4. In the list of services, right-click World Wide Web Publishing Service, and then click Start.

IIS is being installed on a FAT volume. This will disable IIS security features. Please consider converting the partition from FAT to NTFS.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\img\compat\iismscs.txt ===
The IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 Web site and FTP site cluster resources are not compatible with IIS 6.0 and will be disabled during the upgrade. Prior to upgrading to IIS 6.0, you should review the "Upgrading on Cluster Nodes" chapter in the Getting Started manual that came with your Microsoft Windows Server 2003 operating system. You can also access the Getting Started Guide text files in the \Docs folder on your Windows Server 2003 operating system installation CD. After upgrading to IIS 6.0, you will then need to migrate your Web site and FTP site cluster resources.

A range of FACILITY_INTERNET has been reserved for IIS components. IIS
components may use values between 0xc800 and 0xcbff in the "code" field
of an HRESULT.

Since there is no automated way to enforce this range (and protect against
duplicate codes) this text file tracks code usage. Whenever a new component
needs to allocate codes within the IIS range, please update this file.

.MC files used to generate HRESULTs allocated from this range should be of
the following format:

    SeverityNames=(Success=0x0,
                   CoError=0x2
                   )

                  )

    Messageid=0xc??? Facility=Internet Severity=CoError SymbolicName=WHATEVER
    Language=English
    Your message goes here.
    .

Also, ensure the .MC file is compiled with "mc -o {other_switches}". The
-o switch tells MC.EXE to generate an "OLE-style" header file.

Implementation Details


Contents:

1. ISVC_INFO
2. Eventlog
3. RequestLog


1. ISVC_INFO:
        This is the common base class for all the Internet services. It
consists of information that is generic to all the services. The data consists
of 
  Supplied Data:
        ServiceName
        ServiceId
        Registry key name for parameters of service
        Module Name ( the dll name of service for resources)

  Internal Data:
        EventLog object
        Request Log Oject (InetLog)
        ModuleHandle
        fValid -- indicating if this object is valid
        tsLock -- resource lock
        AdminName name of administrator  (from registry)
        AdminEmail email for administrator (from registry)
        AdminComment comment about this server (from registry)


 From the ISVC_INFO object we derive two kinds of objects
        IGSVC_INFO  -- Internet Gateway service info object
        IPSVC_INFO  -- Internet Publishing service info object
  ( At present IPSVC_INFO is also called TSVC_INFO (old name))

 IPSVC_INFO:
        This object consists of common information for all Internet Publishing
services. Currently the services include Gopher, FTP and WWW services. The
data maintained by this object includes all those in ISVC_INFO and the
following:
  Supplied Data:
        Anonymous User Name
        Anonymous Password Secret Name
        Virtual Roots Secret Name
        Function pointer for initialization of service
        Function pointer for cleanup of service on termination
        
  Internal Data:
        fValid -- if this object is valid
        AnonymousUserToken
        tsCache - cache object for cached objects
        Accept IP address list ( from registry)
        Deny IP address list (from registry)

LKRhash: Larson-Krishnan-Reilly Hash Tables
===========================================

LKRhash is a fast, thread-safe, scalable, multiprocessor-friendly,
processor cache-friendly hashtable based on P.-A. Larson's linear hash
tables.  See lkrhash.h for details.

http://GeorgeRe/work/LKRhash/ is the official MS-internal
website for LKRhash. Please check there occasionally for
updates.

LKRhash can be redistributed to customers in binary format
only. Do not distribute the source outside of Microsoft.

Use VC 6.0 to build lkrhash.dsw.  This will build lkrhash.dll,
which contains the implementation of the hashtable, and
hashtest.exe, a test program.  To run, use
    .\release\hashtest.exe words.ini      (or files.ini)
(words.* and files.* can be found in data.zip)

Alternatively, if you're using the NT build environment, adapt
the `dirs' and `sources' files to your needs.

To make LKRhash work with other code, you'll need to
    #define USE_DEBUG_CRTS
before #including <irtldbg.h>, which is #included by <lkrhash.h>.
If you don't, you're likely to see a complaint from the compiler
that it can't find <pudebug.h>.

If you're using LKRhash in the same module where you're building
it, you'll need to add the following two lines to your .cpp files
before you include <lkrhash.h>
    #define DLL_IMPLEMENTATION
    #define IMPLEMENTATION_EXPORT
    #include <lkrhash.h>

Namespaces are now turned on by default. All functions declared
in <lkrhash.h> are declared in the `LKRhash' namespace, and all
functions declared in <hashfn.h> are in the `HashFn' namespace.
If you don't want this behavior, you'll need to add the following
two lines to your .cpp files before you include <lkrhash.h>
    #define __LKRHASH_NO_NAMESPACE__
    #define __HASHFN_NO_NAMESPACE__
    #include <lkrhash.h>
Alternatively, you can add the following
    using namespace LKRhash;
    using namespace HashFn;

LKRhash now comes with an NTSD debugger extension DLL,
lkrdbg. Since debugger extensions can't be used with msdev,
there's no msdev-style .dsp for lkrdbg. You'll have to build it
with the NT build environment (or build a makefile by hand). See
lkrdbg\readme.txt for more details.

LKRDBG is an NTSD debugger extension for LKRhash. You must
install it in a directory on your path, such as
%SystemRoot%\system32.

Notes about using AcWebSvc.dll
------------------------------
In order for AcWebSvc.dll to hook a process, two things must happen:
 - AcWebSvc.dll must be copied into the %windir%\apppatch directory.
 - An entry must be made in the App Compat database.

To create the entry in the App Compat database, it's necessary
to create an xml file describing the process to be hooked.

Below is sample xml that describes a pretty contrived scenario.  It
basically hooks notepad.exe and associates it with an IIS application
called "Notepad IIS App!".  This fake application includes two ISAPI
extensions called, GetClientInfo.dll and ReadEntity.dll, which are
installed in a path that can be acquired by reading a key from the
registry.  It has a dependency on its own ISAPI extensions and also
something (that is also made up) called IISASP60.  Finally, the sample
uses a setup indicator file, called "file.txt" to determine whether
the app is installed or not (note that this entry is optional in the
xml, and if a SetupIndicatorFile is not present, the shim will use
the presence of any of the listed extensions to determine if the
shimmed process installed or uninstalled.)  Finally, the shim is
able to force enable all dependencies of this application, including
both its own extensions and any dependent applications.  To do this,
set the "HonorDisabledExtensionsAndApplications" setting to "FALSE".
Note that this violates our suggested best practices for app
installation, and will enable all dependencies even if the administrator
for the server intentionally disabled them for security reasons.

To insert the xml into the database, first create a database file
by running the following command, which produces a file called
notepad.sdb:

     shimdbc custom notepad.xml notepad.sdb

Finally, to include the notepad.sdb file into the database, run
the following command:

     sdbinst notepad.sdb

Once these steps are done, any processes called "notepad.exe" will
inject AcWebSvc.dll and hook on process exit.

To remove the entry from the AppCompat database, run the
following command:

     sdbinst -u notepad.exe

For more information about creating xml to describe a "real"
application, see the following:

     http://winwebsites/AppCompat/Development.

For more information about how the DATA tags work with
the IIS lockdown mechanism, see section 4.1.2.1 of the
following:

info on things to watch out for when adding a file to iis
---------------------------------------------------------

Adding a binary file to iis

1. You have to change iisend.inx
   as well as iismid_*.inx
   as well as iisend_*.inx to make the file install

2. you'll have to change nt\inetsrv\iis\placefil.txt to make the file binplace to the binaries dir
   or nt\inetsrv\iis\placefil5.txt if it's for the iis51 built only binaries

3. you'll have to add the file to hardcode.lst
   (so that postbuild info on this file is created and so that localization knows that it must localizes this file)
   localization looks in this file to determine which files it needs to localize that are outside of the cabs...

4. You'll have to modify nt\mergedcomponents\setupinfs\layout.inx
   and make sure that the file gets downloaded during winnt32.exe for the right SKU (and only for those sku's!)

5. if the file is in regard to inetmgr, then adminpak needs to get notifed of any changes!

6. if the file is another counter then, have to investigate if it's a ia64 counter that needs to be installed in the syswow64 directory on ia64 machines!

; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory.
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off
; the root of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).
; If there are multiple class names for a single image, use a colon to separate
; each.
;
; All bits that ship in the NT base product and are installed with winnt32,
; must have a class name of retail.
;
; If you add a new file to the list, please refrain from creating your own
; special section.  Doing so makes it difficult to detect duplicates.  If
; you're unable to add your image due to a collision with an existing name,
; work it out with the other developer.  Options include creating another
; placefil.txt for your project or using the ALT_PROJECT_TARGET macro in your
; sources file to change the base of the distribution point (doing so means
; your project will not install as part of base NT).
;
;     sort /+17 < placefil.txt > placefil.srt
;
; will generate a list sorted by class name if you want.

;//					objects.
;//
;//		languages:	An ID corresponding to the language subkey in the Registry.
;//
;//		offset:		A symbolic constant defined in SymbolFile.  Offsets must be consecutive
;//					even numbers beginning with zero.  These offsets determine
;//					the order in which the counters are installed in the Counters
;//					and Help values in the Registry.

I.  PURPOSE

      This document details a simple test plan for the Windows NT FTP Server
      Performance Counters.


 II.  OVERVIEW

      The Windows NT FTP Server Performance Counters may be installed from
      \\KAYAK\RESKIT\FTPCTRS.  INSTALL.BAT will install the counters, and
      REMOVE.BAT will remove the counters.  These .BAT files *MUST* be run
      from the FTPCTRS directory.

      Running INSTALL.BAT will install the performance counters.  These
      counters are used by PERFMON.EXE to monitor the activity of the
      Windows NT FTP Server.  The following attributes may be monitored:

           0.  Bytes Sent/sec

               This is the rate that data bytes are sent by the FTP
               Server.

           1.  Bytes Received/sec

               This is the rate that data bytes are received by the
               FTP Server.

           2.  Bytes Total/sec

               This is sum of Bytes Sent/sec and Bytes Received/sec.
               This is the total rate of bytes transferred by the
               FTP Server.

           3.  Files Sent

               This is the total number of files sent by the FTP
               Server.

           4.  Files Received

               This is the total number of files received by the
               FTP Server.

           5.  Files Total

               This is sum of Files Sent and Files Received.  This
               is the total number of files transferred by the FTP
               Server.

           6.  Current Anonymous Users

               This is number of anonymous users currently connected
               to the FTP Server.

           7.  Current NonAnonymous Users

               This is number of non-anonymous users currently
               connected to the FTP Server.

           8.  Total Anonymous Users

               This is total number of anonymous users that have
               ever connected to the FTP Server.

           9.  Total NonAnonymous Users

               This is total number of non-anonymous users that have
               ever connected to the FTP Server.

          10.  Maximum Anonymous Users

               This is maximum number of anonymous users
               simultaneously connected to the FTP Server.

          11.  Maximum NonAnonymous Users

               This is maximum number of non-anonymous users
               simultaneously connected to the FTP Server.

          12.  Current Connections

               This is the current number of connections to the FTP
               Server.

          13.  Maximum Connections

               This is maximum number of simultaneous connections to
               the FTP Server.

          14.  Connection Attempts

               This is the number of connection attempts that have
               been made to the FTP Server.

          15.  Logon Attempts

               This is the number of logon attempts that have been
               made to the FTP Server.

          16.  Service Uptime

               Number in seconds since service was started. Accounted 
               for FTP sites also. Pausing is not accounted.


III.  TESTING

      These tests assume the test machine has TCP/IP installed, but
      does *NOT* yet have the FTP Server installed.  Also, LODCTR.EXE,
      UNLODCTR.EXE, and REGINI.EXE must be on the path.

      These tests also assume the user knows how to run PerfMon.


           0.  Run INSTALL.BAT from some directory other than FTPCTRS
               (i.e. cd to K:\FOO then execute \FTPCTRS\INSTALL).  This
               should fail with an appropriate error message (must be
               run from FTPCTRS directory).

           1.  Do the same thing with REMOVE.BAT.  This should also fail.

           2.  From the FTPCTRS directory, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               fail.

           3.  From the FTPCTRS directory, run INSTALL.BAT.  This should
               fail with an appropriate error message (FTP Server not
               installed).

               NOTE:  This will succeed on an IDW installation.

           4.  Run NCPA and install the FTP Server.  Reboot.

           5.  From the FTPCTRS directory, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               fail.

           6.  From the FTPCTRS directory, run INSTALL.BAT.  This should
               succeed.

           8.  Run PerfMon & verify that the counters are working.
               Select the FTP Server object and the default counter.
               Then connect to the target machine via the FTP client and
               verify the Bytes Total/sec counter is responding.

               Also, verify that each of the counters listed in section II
               are visible.

           7.  Run INSTALL.BAT again.  This should also succeed.

           9.  Run PerfMon again to verify nothing messed up.

          10.  Run REMOVE.BAT.  This should succeed.

          11.  Run PerfMon to verify the FTP Server object is no longer
               displayed in the "objects" combo box.

          12.  Run INSTALL.BAT again.  This should succeed.

          13.  Run PerfMon to verify the counters were reinstalled.

          14.  While PerfMon is running, stop the FTP Server with
               either NET.EXE or the Services applet.  PerfMon should
               continue chugging along with no FTP activity displayed.

               There will be no other indication in PerfMon that the
               service has been stopped.

          15.  While PerfMon is still running, restart the service.
               Verify that PerfMon is now displaying service activity
               by connecting to the server with the FTP client.

          16.  While PerfMon is running, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               succeed.

               PerfMon will still allow you to add/remove FTP Server
               counters until you exit the PerfMon app.

          17.  Exit & restart PerfMon.  The FTP Server counters should

This file contains the version history of the Windows NT FTP Server Service.


Date        Details
--------    -------

03/08/93    Starting coding.

07/30/93    Initial release, part of Windows NT Product 1.0.

09/10/93    Fixed problem with aggressive client firewalls refusing
            connections from sockets bound to nonreserved ports.
            QFE Bug #3633.

09/13/94    Added integrated path canonicalization code so that I could
            remove the "lock/chdir/fileopen/unlock" stuff that was such
            a huge bottleneck on MP machines. For Power PC release.

12/06/94    If user doesn't specify a domain name, pass the local machine's
            primary domain into LsaLogonUser. Previous versions would pass
            in an empty string, which would cause LSA to search for known
            accounts, which is NOT what we want it to do.

08/15/95    Initial Beta for Gibraltar High-Performance FTP server (MuraliK)

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\svcs\ftp\server\registry.txt ===
This file details the registry structure & specific values used by the
FTP Server service.


All FTP Server parameters "live" under the following key:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
        System
            CurrentControlSet
                Services
                    FtpSvc
                        Parameters

The following values may exist under the Parameters key:

    Name:       AllowAnonymous
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then anonymous logons are allowed.
                Otherwise (value IS zero) anonymous logons are not allowed.
    Default:    1 (allow anonymous logons)

    Name:       AllowGuestAccess
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then guest-access logons are
                allowed.  Otherwise (value IS zero) guest-access logons
                are not allowed.  (Note that guest-access has nothing to
                do with the "Guest" account; guest-access is granted if
                the local machine's user rights policy states that
                "Everyone" may access the machine from the network.  Any
                user that tries to logon with an unknown account will be
                granted guest-access.)
    Default:    1 (allow guest-access)

    Name:       AnnotateDirectories
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then everytime a user changes
                directories (sends the server a CWD command) an attempt is
                made to open a file called "~FTPSVC~.CKM" in the new
                directory.  If this file is found, its contents are sent
                to the user as part of the successful reply to the CWD
                command.  This may be used to attach "annotations" to
                specific directories.

                This value is used as a default for new users.  Users can
                toggle their own personal "annotate directories" flag with
                the site-specific CKM command (SITE CKM).
    Default:    0 (don't annotate directories)

    Name:       AnonymousOnly
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then only anonymous logons are
                allowed.  Otherwise (value IS zero) then non-anonymous
                logons are allowed as well.
    Default:    0 (non-anonymous logons allowed).

    Name:       AnonymousUserName
    Type:       REG_SZ
    Meaning:    Anonymous logon alias.  When a user attempts an anonymous
                logon, the username specified ("anonymous") is mapped to
                this registry value for the purposes off authentication
                and impersonation.  The password for this account is stored
                in an LSA secret object named "FTPD_ANONYMOUS_DATA".
    Default:    "Guest"

    Name:       ConnectionTimeout
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    The time (in seconds) to allow clients to remain idle before
                forcibly disconnecting them.  This prevents idle clients
                from consuming server resources indefinitely.

                This value may be set to zero if timeouts are not to be
                enforced.  If set to zero, idle clients *can* remain connected
                indefinitely.
    Default:    600 (10 minutes)

    Name:       DebugFlags
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This value is used only by the debugging (checked) builds of
                the FTP Server.  It controls the output of various debugging
                information.  This value is unused by retail builds.
    Default:    0 (no debug output)

    Name:       DefaultLogonDomain
    Type:       REG_SZ
    Meaning:    The domain name to use when validating user logon requests
                if the user did not specify a domain.  If this value does
                not exist in the registry, then the FTP Server will use the
                local machine's primary logon domain instead.
    Default:    NULL (use the local machine's primary logon domain)

    Name:       DisableExtendedCharFilenames
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    RFC 0959 says only 7bi ASCII characters can be used to specify
                file names in FTP commands. DeFacto, 8bit chars are being used
                to specify extended char names and DBCS encoding. If this value
                does not exists, or if it exists but set to 0, extended chars
                are being accepted. If the value is 1, extended char file names
                are rejected.
    Default:    Not created. (extended chars enabled)

    Name:       ExitMessage
    Type:       REG_SZ
    Meaning:    This is the signoff message sent to a client upon receipt
                of a QUIT command.
    Default:    "Goodbye."

    Name:       GreetingMessage
    Type:       REG_MULTI_SZ
    Meaning:    This message (if it exists in the registry) is sent to new
                clients after their account has been validated.  In accordance
                with "de facto" Internet behaviour, if a client logs on as
                anonymous and specifies an identity starting with '-' (minus),
                then this greeting message is NOT sent.
    Default:    NULL (no special greeting)

    Name:       BannerMessage
    Type:       REG_MULTI_SZ
    Meaning:    This message (if it exists in the registry) is sent to new
                clients when they connect, right after the service name.
    Default:    NULL (no special greeting)

    Name:       HomeDirectory
    Type:       REG_EXPAND_SZ
    Meaning:    This is the initial "home" directory for new clients.  After
                a new client is validated, an attempt is made to CHDIR to
                this directory.  If this directory is inaccessible, the client
                is refused FTP services.  If the CHDIR is successful, then
                an attempt is made to CHDIR to a directory with the same name
                as the client's username.  If this fails, an attempt is made
                to CHDIR to a directory called "Default".  If this fails,
                the current directory is left at "home".

                If a user finds that the home directory is inaccessible,
                then an event is written to the event log indiciating such.
    Default:    "C:\"

    Name:       ListenBacklog
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This is the "backlog" parameter passed into the listen()
                API.  This sets the maximum number of unaccepted connections
                that can be queued against the socket that listens on the
                main FTP port.
    Default:    5

    Name:       LogAnonymous
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then all successful anonymous
                logons are logged in the system event log.  Otherwise
                (value IS zero) successful anonymous logons are not logged.
    Default:    0 (don't log successful anonymous logons)

    Name:       LogFileAccess
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This value controls the logging of file accesses.  This value
                can be one of the following:

                        0 = Don't log file accesses
                        1 = Log file accesses to FTPSVC.LOG
                        2 = Log file accesses to FTyymmdd.LOG, where yy
                                is the year, mm is the month, and dd is
                                the day.  A new log file will be opened
                                every day as necessary.
    Default:    0 (don't log file accesses)

    Name:       LogFileDirectory
    Type:       REG_SZ
    Meaning:    This value specifies the target directory for log files.
                This value is only used if LogFileAccess is !0.
    Default:    %SystemRoot%\System32

    Name:       LogNonAnonymous
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then all successful nonanonymous
                logons are logged in the system event log.  Otherwise
                (value IS zero) successful nonanonymous logons are not logged.
    Default:    0 (don't log successful nonanonymous logons)

    Name:       LowercaseFiles
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then all file names returned by
                LIST and NLST commands for non-case-preserving filesystems
                will be mapped to lowercase.  If this value is zero, then
                all file names will be unaltered.
    Default:    0 (don't map filenames to lowercase)

    Name:       MaxClientsMessage
    Type:       REG_SZ
    Meaning:    This message (if it exists) is sent to a client if the maximum
                number of clients has been reached/exceeded.  This indicates
                that the server is currently servicing the maximum number of
                simultaneous clients and is refusing addtional clients.
    Default:    "Maximum clients reached, service unavailable."

    Name:       MaxConnections
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This is the maximum number of simultaneous clients the server
                will service.

                This value may be set to zero if there is to be no limit on
                simultaneous clients.
    Default:    20

    Name:       MsdosDirOutput
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    If this value is non-zero, then the output of the LIST
                command (usually sent as a result of a DIR from the client)
                will look like the output of the MS-DOS DIR command.
                Otherwise (value IS zero) then the output of the LIST command
                will look like the output of the UNIX LS command.

                This value also controls "slash flipping" in the path
                sent by the PWD command.  If this value is non-zero, the path
                will contain backward "\" slashes.  If this value IS zero, the
                path will contain forward "/" slashes.
    Default:    1 (directory listings like MS-DOS)

    Name:       ReadAccessMask
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This value is a bitmask and controls the "readability" of
                the various disk volumes in the system.  Drive A: corresponds
                to bit zero, drive B: is bit 1, drive C: is bit 2, etc.  A
                user may only read from a specific volume if the corresponding
                bit is set.
    Default:    0 (all read access denied)

    Name:       WriteAccessMask
    Type:       REG_DWORD
    Meaning:    This value is a bitmask and controls the "writability" of
                the various disk volumes in the system.  Drive A: corresponds
                to bit zero, drive B: is bit 1, drive C: is bit 2, etc.  A
                user may only write to a specific volume if the corresponding
                bit is set.
    Default:    0 (all write access denied)


There is an additional (optional) key that may exist under the Parameters
key.  After a user's account/password has been validated and the server is
impersonating that user, an attempt is made to open a key named "AccessCheck".
If this key exists, and the user cannot open it, then the user is denied
access to the FTP Server.  If this key exists, and the user can only open it
for read access, then the user is given read-only access to the FTP Server.
This way, an administrator can create this "AccessCheck" key and attach
specific ACLs to the key. These ACLs will then control access to the FTP
Server.

Level 1:   atq\   tsstr\  cache\  sec\  dirlist\
 These modules should have dependencies within themselves.
 Should not depend on outside modules.

Level 2:  dbgext\  common\ festrcnv\
 These modules can depend on Level 1 modules.

Level 3:  info\
 These modules can depend on Level 1 & Level 2.

Please maintain the proper dependencies and do not introduce any circular
 dependencies.

Note: spud is not in the dirs file because it has dependencies on the
ntos project. To build uspud.lib you must cd into the spud directory
then check out the version of uspud.lib under the platform subdirectory
for which you are building. You can then build uspud.lib.

ATQ based Bandwidth Throttle
 Author: MuraliK
 Date:   25-May-1995

Goal:
 Given a specified bandwidth which should be used as threshold,
the ATQ module shall throttle traffic, gracefully. Minimum CPU impact
should be seen; Minor variations above specified threshold is
allowed. Performance in the fast cause (no throttle) should be high
and involve less stuff in the critical path.

Given:
  M -- an administrator specified bandwidth which should not be
exceeded in most cases. (assume to be specified through a special API
interface added to ATQ module)

Solution:
 Various solutions are possible based on measurements and metrics
chosen. Whenever two possible solutions are possible, we pick the
simplest one to avoid complexity and performance impact. (Remember to
K.I.S.S.)

 Sub Problems:
1) Determination of Exisiting Usage:
  At real time determining existing usage exactly is computationally
intensive. We resort to approximate measures whenever possible.
Idea is:  Estimated Bandwidth = (TotalBytesSent / PeriodOfObservation).

 solution a)
	Use a separate thread for sampling and calculating the
bandwidth. Whenever an IO operation completes (we return from
GetQueuedCompletionStatus()), increment the TotalBytesSent for the
period under consideration.  The sampling thread wakes up at regular
intervals and caclulates the bandwidth effective at that time. The solution
also uses histogramming to smooth out sudden variations in the bandwidth.
This solution is:
 + good, since it limits complexity in calculating bandwidth
 - ignores completion of IO simultaneously => sudden spikes are possible.
 - ignores the duration took for actual IO to complete (results could be
misleading)
 - requires separate sampling thread for bandwidth calculation.

 solution b)
   	This solution uses a running approximation of time taken for
completing an i/o of standard size viz., 1 KB transfer. Initially we start
with an approximation of 0 Bytes sent/second (reasonable, since we just
started). When an IO completes, the time taken for transfer then is
calculated from the count of bytes sent and time required from inception to
end of IO. Now we do a simple average of existing approximation and the
newly caculated time. This gives the next approximation for bandwidth/time
taken. Successively the calculations refine the effective usage measurement
made. (However, we must note, by so simplifying, we offset ourselves from
worrying about the concurrency in IO processing.) In case of concurrent
transfers time taken for data transfer is larger than the actual time only
for the particular transfer. Hence, the solution makes conservative
estimates based on this measured value.

 +  no separate thread for sampling
 + simple interface & function to calculate bandwidth.
 - avoids unusaual spikes seen in above solution.


2) Determination of Action to be performed:
  The allowed operations in ATQ module include Read, Write and
TransmitFile. When a new operation is submitted, we need to evaluate if it
is safe(allow), marginally safe(block) or unsafe(reject) to perform the
operation. Evaluation of "safety"ness  is tricky and involves knowledge
about the operations, buffers used, CPU overhead for the operation setup,
and estimated and specified bandwidths.
 Assume M and B as specified and estimated bandwidths respectively. Let
R,W, and T stand for the operations Read, Write and TransmitFile. In
addition assume that s and b are used as suffixes for small and big
transfers. Definition of small and big are arbitrary and should be fixed
empirically. Please refer the following table for actions to be performed.

Action Table:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        \ Action  |
Bandwidth\ to be  |  Allow            Block               Reject
comparison\ Done  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  M > B              R,W,T              -                   -

  M ~= B             W, T               R                   -
(approx. equal)                 (reduces future traffic)

  M < B              Ws, Ts          Wb, Tb                 R
                                              (reject on LongQueue)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rationale:
   case M > B:  In this case, the services are not yet hitting the limits
specified, so it is acceptable to allow all the operations to occur without
any blockage.

   case M ~= B:  (i.e.  -delta <= |(M - B)| <= +delta
[Note:  We use approximation, since exact equal is costly to calculate.]
 At this juncture, the N/w usage is at the brink of specified bandwidth. It
is good to take some steps to reduce future traffic. Servers operate on
serve-a-request basis -- they receive requests from clients and act upon
them. It is hence worthwhile to limit the number of requests getting
submitted to the active queue banging on the network. By delaying the Read,
processing of requests are delayed artificially, leading to delayed load on
the network. By the time delayed reads proceed, hopefully the network is
eased up and hence server will stabilise. As far as write and transmit
goes, certain amount of CPU processing is done and it is worthwhile to
perform them, rather than delaying and queueing, wasting CPU usage.

 Another possibility is: Do Nothing. In most cases, the load may be coming
down, in which case the bandwidth utilized will naturally get low. To the
contrary allowing reads to proceed may result in resulting Write and
Transmit loads. Due to this potential danger, we dont adopt this solution.

 case M < B:
 The bandwidth utilization has exceeded the specified limit. This is an
important case that deserves regulation. Heavy gains are achieved by
adopting reduced reads and delaying Wb and Tb. Better yet, reads can be
rejected indicating that the server is busy or network is busy. In most
cases when the server goes for a read operation, it is at the starting
point of processing any future request from client (exception is: FTP
server doing control reads, regularly.) Hence, it is no harm rejecting the
read request entirely. In addition, blocking Wb and Tb delays their impact
on the bandwidth, and brings down the bandwidth utilization faster than
possible only by rejecting Reads. We dont want to reject Wb or Tb, simply
because the amount of CPU work done for the same may be too high. By
blocking them, most of the CPU work does not go waste.


Implementation:
 To be continued later.


 The action table is simplified as shown below to keep the implementation
simpler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  M > B              R,W,T              -                   -

  M ~= B             W, T               R                   -
(approx. equal)                 (reduces future traffic)

  M < B              W,                T                   R
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Status and Entry point Modifications:

 We keep track of three global variables, one each for each of the
operations: Read, Write and XmitFile. The values of these variables
indicate if the operation is allowed, blocked or rejected. The entry points
AtqReadFile(), AtqWriteFile() and AtqXmitFile() are modified to check the
status and do appropriate action. If the operation is allowed, then
operation proceeds normally. If the operation is blocked, then we store
the context in a blocked list. The parameters of the entry points, which
are required for restarting the operation are also stored along with
context. The operation is rejected, if the status indicates rejection. All
these three global variables are read, without any synchronization
primitives around them. This will potentially lead to minor
inconsistencies, which is acceptable. However, performance is improved
since there is no syncronization primitive that needs to be accessed.( This
assertion however is dependent upon SMP implementations and needs to be
verified. It is deferred for current implementation.)

I.  PURPOSE

      This document details a simple test plan for the Windows NT INFO Server
      Performance Counters.


 II.  OVERVIEW

      The Windows NT INFO Server Performance Counters may be installed from
      \\KAYAK\RESKIT\INFOCTRS.  INSTALL.BAT will install the counters, and
      REMOVE.BAT will remove the counters.  These .BAT files *MUST* be run
      from the INFOCTRS directory.

      Running INSTALL.BAT will install the performance counters.  These
      counters are used by PERFMON.EXE to monitor the activity of the
      Windows NT INFO Server.  The following attributes may be monitored:

           0.  Bytes Sent/sec

               This is the rate that data bytes are sent by the INFO
               Server.

           1.  Bytes Received/sec

               This is the rate that data bytes are received by the
               INFO Server.

           2.  Bytes Total/sec

               This is sum of Bytes Sent/sec and Bytes Received/sec.
               This is the total rate of bytes transferred by the
               INFO Server.

           3.  Files Sent

               This is the total number of files sent by the INFO
               Server.

           4.  Files Received

               This is the total number of files received by the
               INFO Server.

           5.  Files Total

               This is sum of Files Sent and Files Received.  This
               is the total number of files transferred by the INFO
               Server.

           6.  Current Anonymous Users

               This is number of anonymous users currently connected
               to the INFO Server.

           7.  Current NonAnonymous Users

               This is number of non-anonymous users currently
               connected to the INFO Server.

           8.  Total Anonymous Users

               This is total number of anonymous users that have
               ever connected to the INFO Server.

           9.  Total NonAnonymous Users

               This is total number of non-anonymous users that have
               ever connected to the INFO Server.

          10.  Maximum Anonymous Users

               This is maximum number of anonymous users
               simultaneously connected to the INFO Server.

          11.  Maximum NonAnonymous Users

               This is maximum number of non-anonymous users
               simultaneously connected to the INFO Server.

          12.  Current Connections

               This is the current number of connections to the INFO
               Server.

          13.  Maximum Connections

               This is maximum number of simultaneous connections to
               the INFO Server.

          14.  Connection Attempts

               This is the number of connection attempts that have
               been made to the INFO Server.

          15.  Logon Attempts

               This is the number of logon attempts that have been
               made to the INFO Server.


III.  TESTING

      These tests assume the test machine has TCP/IP installed, but
      does *NOT* yet have the INFO Server installed.  Also, LODCTR.EXE,
      UNLODCTR.EXE, and REGINI.EXE must be on the path.

      These tests also assume the user knows how to run PerfMon.


           0.  Run INSTALL.BAT from some directory other than INFOCTRS
               (i.e. cd to K:\FOO then execute \INFOCTRS\INSTALL).  This
               should fail with an appropriate error message (must be
               run from INFOCTRS directory).

           1.  Do the same thing with REMOVE.BAT.  This should also fail.

           2.  From the INFOCTRS directory, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               fail.

           3.  From the INFOCTRS directory, run INSTALL.BAT.  This should
               fail with an appropriate error message (INFO Server not
               installed).

               NOTE:  This will succeed on an IDW installation.

           4.  Run NCPA and install the INFO Server.  Reboot.

           5.  From the INFOCTRS directory, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               fail.

           6.  From the INFOCTRS directory, run INSTALL.BAT.  This should
               succeed.

           8.  Run PerfMon & verify that the counters are working.
               Select the INFO Server object and the default counter.
               Then connect to the target machine via the INFO client and
               verify the Bytes Total/sec counter is responding.

               Also, verify that each of the counters listed in section II
               are visible.

           7.  Run INSTALL.BAT again.  This should also succeed.

           9.  Run PerfMon again to verify nothing is messed up.

          10.  Run REMOVE.BAT.  This should succeed.

          11.  Run PerfMon to verify the INFO Server object is no longer
               displayed in the "objects" combo box.

          12.  Run INSTALL.BAT again.  This should succeed.

          13.  Run PerfMon to verify the counters were reinstalled.

          14.  While PerfMon is running, stop the INFO Server with
               either NET.EXE or the Services applet.  PerfMon should
               continue chugging along with no INFO activity displayed.

               There will be no other indication in PerfMon that the
               service has been stopped.

          15.  While PerfMon is still running, restart the service.
               Verify that PerfMon is now displaying service activity
               by connecting to the server with the INFO client.

          16.  While PerfMon is running, run REMOVE.BAT.  This should
               succeed.

               PerfMon will still allow you to add/remove INFO Server
               counters until you exit the PerfMon app.

          17.  Exit & restart PerfMon.  The INFO Server counters should
               not be available.

                                Fixed bugs in HTTP_HEADERS::ParseInput()

Summary :
 This file describes the files in the directory irtl\httphdr
     and details related to HTTP Header Dictionary.


File            Description

README.txt      This file.
httphdr.hxx     Header file containing declarations.
httphdr.cxx     Implementation of Header Mapper and Header dictionary.
tdict.cxx       Test program for Dictionary headers.


Implementation Details

Contents:
1. Design of Dictionary and Mapper
2. Replacements for old PARAM_LIST object in w3svc


1. Design of Dictionary and Mapper

 class HTTP_HEADER_MAPPER

<To Be Done>

2. Replacements for old PARAM_LIST object in w3svc

 O L D                  =>      N E W 

HEADER_MAP::
        Reset()         => HTTP_HEADERS::Reset()
        Store()         => HTTP_HEADERS:FastMapStore()
        Cancel()        => HTTP_HEADERS:FastMapCancel()
        MaxIndex()      => HTTP_HEADERS::FastMapMaxIndex()
        MaxMap()        => HTTP_HEADER_MAPPER::NumItems()
        CheckConcatAndStore() => HTTP_HEADERS::FastMapStoreWithConcat()
        QueryStrValue() => HTTP_HEADERS::FastMapQueryStrValue()
        QueryValue()    => HTTP_HEADERS::FastMapQueryValue()
        IsEmpty()       => Nuked

PARAM_LIST::
        Reset()         => HTTP_HEADERS::Reset()
        GetFastMap()    => No need - use Fast map functions directly
        FindValue()     => HTTP_HEADERS::FindValue()
        RemoveEntry()   => CancelHeader()
        AddEntryUsingConcat() => HTTP_HEADERS::StoreHeader()
        AddEntry()      => filter uses this - StoreHeader() is sufficient
                          -- rewriting code to check fast-map and op, is better


        Enumerator functions:
        NextPair()  => are hard to achieve. Since the "header-name" is 
                        not NULL terminated. We have to work-around this
                        by fixing the users of this call.

                        New Enumerators will return NAME_VALUE_PAIRS
                                FastMapEnumerate(),
                                ChunkEnumerator()
  Nuked:
        GetCount()
        AddParam()
        ParsePairs()
        ParseSimpleList()
        ParseHeaderList()

Randfail can be used to introduce "random" failures into debug builds in
order to test the error paths of your code.  This is done by causing certain
Win32 APIs to fail, or by instrumenting your code.

The following Win32 APIs will be instrumented in a debug build:
	CreateDirectory
	CreateDirectoryEx
	CreateEvent
	CreateFile
	CreateFileMapping
	CreateIoCompletionPort
	CreateMutex
	CreateProcess
	CreateSemaphore
	CreateThread
	GetQueuedCompletionStatus
	OpenEvent
	OpenFileMapping
	OpenMutex
	OpenProcess
	OpenSemaphore
	PostQueuedCompletionStatus
	ReadFile
	WriteFile

When an instrumented Win32 API fails, it will return the failure indicated
by the documentation, but will also SetLastError(ERROR_ARENA_TRASHED).


INSTRUMENTING YOUR CODE

In order for your code to use this library, you must include "randfail.h"
AFTER any other include files.  Also, you must link with exstrace.lib
and call InitAsyncTrace().  By default, the failure of Win32 APIs is
enabled.  If you wish to suppress this behavior, define the
preprocessor symbol NOFAIL_WIN32API.

User code may also be instrumented.  To determine if the failure path should
be taken, call fTimeToFail().  For example:

	#include <windows.h>
	#include "randfail.h"

	BOOL bOK;
	if (fTimeToFail()) {
		bOK = FALSE;
	} else {
		bOK = fMyFunction();
	}

	if (!bOK) {
		// Handle the error here
	}

To suppress the failures in user instrumented code, define NOFAIL_RANDOM.

 

ENABLING RANDOM FAILURES DURING EXECUTION

Before executing your program, you must set the frequency in which you
wish failures to occur in the registry.  Create the following key:

	SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MosTrace\CurrentVersion\DebugAsyncTrace
		FailureRate REG_DWORD nn

where nn is the frequency you wish the errors to occur (every nn calls
to an instrumented api.)  To disable the failures, either delete the
key or set it to zero.

Description:
------------

UrlScan is an ISAPI filter to analyze and screen HTTP requests being made to
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).  When properly configured,
UrlScan is effective at reducing the exposure of an IIS server to potential
attacks on the internet.

This filter allows the administrator to configure IIS to reject requests based
on the following criteria:

 - The request method (verb)
 - The file extension of the resource requested
 - Suspicious URL encoding
 - Presence of non ASCII characters in the URL
 - Presence of particular character sequences in the URL
 - Presence of particular headers in the request

In the event a request is denied by UrlScan, the action will be logged with
the reason for the denial and information about the request (typically, the
complete URL and IP address of the source of the request will be logged).
When a denial occurs, the response to the client is a simple "404 Object
not found" response.  This response reduces the possibility of inadvertently
disclosing any information about the nature of the server to a possible
attacker.

Also, UrlScan provides the administrator with the option of deleting or
altering the "Server:" header in the response.

It is important to note that the strategy that UrlScan uses to protect a
server from attacks is that it "turns off" functionality that's not being
used by the server.  The default UrlScan.ini file included with this sample
assumes that the server will be serving static content (HTML files, images,
etc.) and ASP pages.  It further assumes that you are not using CGI (.exe)
pages, not publishing content via WebDAV or FrontPage Server Extensions,
not using Index Server, not using Internet Printing, not using Server Side
Includes, etc.  Each of the settings in the sample UrlScan.ini file is
commented to reflect which feature it's associated with.  If you need to
modify the UrlScan.ini file to "turn on" one of these features, it is
important that you search for relevant patches at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security.

To Install:
-----------

Use the following steps in Internet Service Manager to install UrlScan as
a global filter (note that UrlScan may be installed as a site filter, but it
is recommended that it be installed as a global filter so that its
functionality applies to the entire server):

1. Copy UrlScan.dll and UrlScan.ini into a local directory on the server.

2. Right Click the server name (not the site name) under Internet Information
Services in MMC and select Properties.

3. Ensure that "WWW Service" is displayed in the Master Properties drop down
list, and click on the Edit button.

4. Choose the "ISAPI Filters" tab and click on the Add button.

5. On the Filter Properties dialog, enter "UrlScan" (without the quotes)
in the Filter Properties box, and enter the full path to UrlScan.dll in the
Executable box.

6. Select "OK" to close each dialog.

7. Restart the web service.

To Run:
-------

After being properly installed, UrlScan will run automatically whenever IIS
is started.  If you would like to confirm UrlScan's operation, locate the
UrlScan.log file in the directory that contians UrlScan.dll.  The log file
will be automatically created by UrlScan (unless UrlScan is configured with
logging disabled), and contains a report of the configured options each
time the server is started.

UrlScan.ini
-----------

UrlScan's operation is controlled by the UrlScan.ini file.  This file should
reside in the same directory as UrlScan.dll, and contains the sections and
options listed below.

Note that UrlScan only reads the ini file at initialization time (for
performance reasons).  It is necessary to stop and start the web service
before any changes to this file will be effective.

Also note that the default options built into UrlScanl.dll will result in
a configuration that will reject all requests to the server.  It is necessary
to provide a UrlScan.ini file for UrlScan to pass requests to be served. A
sample UrlScan.ini file is provided that contains the recommended settings
to defend against known attacks against IIS servers at the time of writing.

The [Options] section configures UrlScan's main options, listed below:

   UseAllowVerbs          - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will read the [AllowVerbs] section of the ini
                            file and reject any request containing an HTTP
                            verb that is not explicitly listed.  The
                            [AllowVerbs] section is case sensitive.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will read the [DenyVerbs] section
                            of the ini file and reject any request
                            containing an HTTP verb listed.  The [DenyVerbs]
                            section is not case sensitive.  The default
                            value for UseAllowVerbs is 1.

   UseAllowExtensions     - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will read the [AllowExtensions] section of the
                            ini file and reject any request where the file
                            extension associated with the URL is not
                            explicitly listed.  If 0, then UrlScan will
                            read the [DenyExtensions] section of the ini
                            file and reject any request where the file
                            extension associated with the request is listed.
                            Both the [AllowExtensions] and [DenyExtensions]
                            sections are case insensitive.  The default
                            value for UseAllowExtensions is 0.
                               
   NormalizeUrlBeforeScan - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will do all of its analysis on the request URLs
                            after IIS decodes and normalizes them.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will do all of its analysis on the
                            raw URLs as sent by the client.  The default
                            value for NormalizeUrlBeforeScan is 1.  Note
                            that only advanced users, who are very
                            knowlegeable about URL parsing, should set this
                            option to 0, as doing so will likely expose the
                            IIS server to canonicalization attacks that
                            bypass proper analysis of the URL extensions.

   VerifyNormalization    - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will verify normalization of the URL.  This
                            action will defend against canonicalization
                            attacks where a URL contains a double encoded
                            string in the URL (ie. The string "%252e" is
                            a double encoded '.' character because "%25"
                            decodes to a '%' character, the first pass
                            decoding of "%252e" results in "%2e", which
                            can be decoded a second time into '.')  If
                            0, then this verification is not done.  The
                            Default value for VerifyNormalization is 1.
                            Note that this option is dependent on the
                            NormalizeUrlBeforeScan option.

   AllowHighBitCharacters - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will allow any byte to exist in the URL.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will reject any request where the
                            URL contains a character outside of the ASCII
                            character set.  This feature can defend against
                            UNICODE or UTF-8 based attacks, but will also
                            reject legitimate requests on IIS servers that
                            use a non-ASCII codepage.  The default value for
                            AllowHighBitCharacters is 1.

   AllowDotInPath         - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will reject any requests containing multiple
                            instances of the '.' character.  If 0, then
                            UrlScan will not perform this test.  Because
                            UrlScan operates at a level where IIS has not
                            yet parsed the URL, it is not possible to
                            determine in all cases whether a '.' character
                            denotes the extension or whether it is a part
                            of the directory path or filename of URL.  For
                            the purposes of extension analysis, UrlScan
                            will always assume that an extension is the
                            part of the URL beginning after the last '.'
                            in the string and ending at the first '?' or
                            '/' character after the '.' or the end of the
                            string.  Setting AllowDotInPath to 1 will
                            defend against the case where an attacker uses
                            a path info to obfuscate the true extension
                            of the request (ie. something like
                            "/path/TrueURL.asp/BogusPart.htm").  Note that
                            this will also cause UrlScan to deny any
                            request that contains a '.' in a directory
                            or file name.  The default value for
                            AllowDotInPath is 0.

   RemoveServerHeader     - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will remove the server header on all responses.
                            If 0, then this action will not be performed.
                            The default value for RemoveServerHeader is 0.
                            Note that this feature is only available if
                            UrlScan is installed on IIS 4.0 or later.

   EnableLogging          - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will log its actions into a file called
                            UrlScan.log that will be created in the same
                            directory that contains UrlScan.dll.  If 0,
                            then no logging will be done.  The default
                            value for EnableLogging is 1.

   PerProcessLogging      - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will append the process ID of the IIS process
                            hosting UrlScan.dll to the log file name (ie.
                            UrlScan.1234.log).  This feature is helpful
                            for IIS versions that can host filters in more
                            than 1 process concurrently (IIS 6.0).  If 0,
                            then the logfile will be UrlScan.log.  The
                            default value of PerProcessLogging is 0.

   AlternateServerName    - Allowed value is a string.  If this setting
                            is present and RemoveServerHeader is 0, then
                            IIS will replace its default "Server:" header
                            in all responses with this string.  The default
                            value for AlternateServerName is an empty string.
                            Note that this feature is only available if
                            UrlScan is installed on IIS 4.0 or later.

   AllowLateScanning      - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will register itself as a low priority filter.
                            This allows other filters to modify the URL
                            before UrlScan does its analysis (note that
                            in addition to this switch, it is necessary
                            to ensure that UrlScan is listed lower on
                            the filter list in the MMC "ISAPI Filters"
                            property sheet for the server).  If this
                            value is 0, the UrlScan will run as a high
                            priority filter.  The default value for
                            AllowLateScanning is 0.  Note that Front Page
                            Server Extensions requires that this setting
                            be 1.

The [AllowVerbs] section contains a list of HTTP verbs (methods).  If
UseAllowVerbs=1 is set in the [Options] section, then UrlScan will reject
any request containing a verb not explicitly listed here.  The entries
in this section are case sensitive.

The [DenyVerbs] section contains a lit of HTTP verbs (methods).  If
UseAllowVerbs=0 is set in the [Options] section, the UrlScan will reject
any request containing a verb that is listed here.  The entries in this
section are case insensitive.

The [DenyHeaders] section contains a list of request headers in the form
"header-name:".  Any request containing a request header listed in this
section will be rejected.  The entries in this section are case
insensitive.

The [AllowExtensions] section contains a list of file extensions in the
form of ".xxx".  If UseAllowExtensions=1 is set in the [Options] section,
then any request containing a URL with an extension not explicitly
listed here is rejected.  The entries in this section are case insensitive.

The [DenyExtensions] section contains a list of file extensions in the
form of ".xxx".  If UseAllowExtensions=0 is set in the [Options] section,
then any request containing a URL with an extension listed here is
rejected.  The entries in this section are case insensitive.

Other Files Used by UrlScan:
------------------------------
UrlScan may create the following files in the directory that contains
UrlScan.dll:

     UrlScan.log - Logs UrlScan activity, including initialization and
                   shutdown, and details for any request that is rejected
                   by UrlScan.

     UrlScan.ini - Contains the configuration options used by UrlScan

-------------------------
SPECweb99 ISAPI Overview:                                         
-------------------------                         
                                      
The specweb99 directory contains the complete source code of three ISAPI
extensions which together, implement the dynamic content requirements
of the SPECweb99 webserver software performance benchmark.  (Please refer
to http://www.spec.org/osg/web99 for further explanation of the SPECweb99
benchmark.)

The source code is divided into three subdirectories: specweb99-GET,
specweb99-POST_AND_CMD and specweb99-CAD.  The source code in each of these
directories independently compile and link into separate ISAPI extension
modules, specweb99-GET.dll, specweb99-POST_AND_CMD.dll and specweb99-
CAD.dll, respectively.  specweb99-GET.dll implements handling of the 
SPECweb99 standard dynamic GET request, specweb99-POST_AND_CMD.dll 
implements handling of the SPECweb99 dynamic POST request as well as the
Reset and Fetch housekeeping functions and specweb99-CAD.dll implements 
handling of a SPECweb99 dynamic GET with custom ad rotation request.

In order to use these ISAPI extensions, the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_
MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SPECweb99 ISAPI" must exist on the server 
machine and must have settings for the following five values set:

(1) ROOT_DIR

    This is a string value that specifies the absolute path of the webserver
    document root directory.  Note that forward slashes, '/', must be used
    and no trailiing slash may be present (e.g. "D:/inetpub/wwwroot", NOT
    "D:/inetpub/wwwroot/", "D:\inetpub\wwwroot" or "D:\inetpub\wwwroot\").

(2) VECTOR_SEND_IO_MODE_CONFIG

    This is a DWORD value that is used to configure the I/O mode used for
    VectorSend calls.  It is set to 1 to indicate use of synchronous mode,
    to 2 to indicate use of asynchronous mode and 3 to indicate use of
    "adaptive" mode.  With this third option, synchronous mode is used to 
    send a body of data below a certain configurable size threshold and
    asynchronous mode is used to send bodies of data whose size is greater
    than or equal to the specified threshold.

(3) VECTOR_SEND_ASYNC_RANGE_START

    This is a DWORD value that specifies, in bytes, the data size threshold
    to use with adaptive mode VectorSend (see the description for VECTOR_
    SEND_IO_MODE_CONFIG).

(4) READ_FILE_IO_MODE_CONFIG

    This is a DWORD value that is used to configure the I/O mode used for
    VectorSend calls.  It is set to 1 to indicate use of synchronous mode,
    to 2 to indicate use of asynchronous mode and 3 to indicate use of
    "adaptive" mode.  With this third option, synchronous mode is used to 
    send a body of data below a certain configurable size threshold and
    asynchronous mode is used to send bodies of data whose size is greater
    than or equal to the specified threshold.

    Note that this value only needs to be set for specweb99-CAD.dll; 
    specweb99-GET.dll and specweb99-POST_AND_CMD.dll do not make use of it.

(5) READ_FILE_ASYNC_RANGE_START

    This is a DWORD value that specifies, in bytes, the data size threshold
    to use with adaptive mode ReadFile (see the description for VECTOR_SEND_
    IO_MODE_CONFIG).

vptool (a simple WAMREG command line tool).

Usage: vptool -Command MetabasePath
Command = CREATEINPROC | CREATEOUTPROC | DELETE | UNLOAD | GETSTATUS

MetabasePath is required for all the commands

CREATEINPROC     - Create an in-proc application on the metabase path
CREATEOUTPROC    - Create an out-proc application on the metabase path
DELETE           - Delete the application on the metabase path if there is one
UNLOAD           - Unload an application on the metabase path from w3svc runtime
					lookup table.
GETSTATUS        - Get status of the application on the metabase path


Purpose:
The vptool is used for unit testing of WAMREG.DLL.  The source code also
provides samples on how to use WamAdmin API in C code.

Files:
	main.cpp	Contains main module
	util.cpp	Contains timing, and command line argument parsing functions
	modules.cpp	Contains basic code that use WamAdmin APIs.

========================================================================
       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : MIME
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this MIME application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your MIME application.


MIME.MAK
    This project file is compatible with the Visual C++ development
	environment. 

    It is also compatible with the NMAKE program provided with Visual C++. 

    To build a debug version of the program from the MS-DOS prompt, type
nmake /f MIME.MAK CFG="Win32 Debug"
    or to build a release version of the program, type
nmake /f MIME.MAK CFG="Win32 Release"

MIME.H
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including RESOURCE.H) and declares the
    CMimeApp application class.

MIME.CPP
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CMimeApp.

MIME.RC
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in the
    Visual C++ development environment.

RES\MIME.ICO
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file MIME.RC.

RES\MIME.RC2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by the Visual C++
	development environment.  You should place all resources not
	editable by the resource editor in this file.


MIME.CLW
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For the main frame window:

mainfrm.H, mainfrm.CPP
    These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from
    CFrameWnd and controls all SDI frame features.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one document type and one view:

mimedoc.H, mimedoc.CPP - the document
    These files contain your CMimeDoc class.  Edit these files to
    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading
    (via CMimeDoc::Serialize).

mimeview.H, mimeview.CPP - the view of the document
    These files contain your CMimeView class.
    CMimeView objects are used to view CMimeDoc objects.
    



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

STDAFX.H, STDAFX.CPP
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named MIME.PCH and a precompiled types file named STDAFX.OBJ.

RESOURCE.H
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\utils\cfgmnt\readme.txt ===
Issues:
- convert COpQueue into COM interface
- SettingsWatch should be integrated into 
	iis\svcs\infocomm\metadata\dll\comobj.cxx function CreateNotifications
	thereby living within the metabase code. There it should CoCreateInstance 
	a COpQueue interface.
- DirWatch should be intergrated w/ IIS core (johnL)
- CQueueWatch should live in IISAdmin
- CopMD::dome should encrypt data if necessary
- add property pages in MMC
- DirWatch filter out certain file-change notifications:
	- overlapping virtual dir structures
	- certain files that should never be versioned
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\utils\dmdiffs\readme.txt ===
Purpose:
    These are simple tools to produce a summary of changes
    to the file system and the metabase between two states.
    
    To make a snapshot of a state, run 
    
    getit <basename>

    which will generate files <basename>.dir and <basename>.mb 
    in current directory.

    To produce a summary of differences between two states, do
    
    doit <old_snapshot_basename> <new_snapshot_basename>
    
    
    Perl for Win32 can be found, for instance, at 
    
    http://www.activestate.com (binary distribution)
    
    
    Please, direct any comments to akozlov.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\utils\metautil\linttest\readme.txt ===
Use mlinttst.asp to check your metabase for lint.

makelint.bat will put a bunch of lint in your metabase for testing purposes.
cleanlnt.bat will remove it afterwards.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\inetsrv\iis\utils\metautil\metaedit\readme.txt ===
Install:

Run the setup program from install\setup.exe

If you already have a previous version of MetaEdit installed you probably can get away
with copying over MetaEdit.exe and MetaUtil.exe and then regsvr32 metautil.dll.


Bugs, issues, etc:

o Backup/Restore not implemented (planned to add under Metabase Menu)
o Find searches the Metabase in natural order.  Since the tree view and list view are 
  sorted, this causes the search to skip around.
o There is no way to view properties under the root node (key = "")
