       Running Setup and
                     Upgrading on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************
         

This part of the text file series provides recommendations for
preparing your system for a new installation or an upgrade, and it
explains how to run Setup for Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

Later sections in this text file provide information about upgrading
a server cluster to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. With
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering
to ensure that users have constant access to important server-based
resources. With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that
appear to users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster
fails, another node begins to provide service (a process known as
failover). Mission-critical applications and resources remain
continuously available.

For more information about the deployment of servers, see the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The following list of headings can help you find the information that
applies to you. For information about planning an upgrade or a new
installation, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about performing a new
installation on server cluster nodes, see Datactr4.TXT.

1.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE RUNNING SETUP
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server before running Setup.

If you are installing Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
on server cluster nodes, be sure to read Datactr4.TXT.

----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.

----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you run Setup, it is recommended that you back up your current
files, unless the computer has no files or the current operating
system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a variety of
different media, such as a tape drive or the hard disk of another
computer on the network.

-------------------------------
1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


======================================================================
2.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN X86-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
x86-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an
Itanium architecture-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
Architecture-based Computer" later in this text file.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting.

For important information to help you make the initial choices
offered by Setup, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about unattended
Setup and other options available when you start Setup, see "Planning
for Unattended Setup" later in this text file.

---------------------------------------------------
2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
-------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by
checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the
Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy
disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line
at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts
will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can
gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message
saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete
list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file,
restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.

2.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
x86-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup for an
upgrade, see "Starting Setup for an Upgrade" later in this text file.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium
architecture-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
Architecture-based Computer" later in this text file.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.

2.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
--------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures.

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running
   Microsoft Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk
   caching. Otherwise, the Setup process (started from Winnt.exe)
   could take a long time. To enable disk caching on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can use SMARTDrive. For
   information about SMARTDrive, see the documentation for
   Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.
 
   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD ON AN X86-BASED
   COMPUTER

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD-ROM drive. This method applies only if you want to perform a
new installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform
an installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive and whether you want to
      perform a new installation (not an upgrade). Continue only if
      both are true.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.

2.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, from a
network, you either share the files directly from the CD or copy them
to a shared folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to
run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, DATACENTER EDITION, FROM A
   NETWORK (X86-BASED COMPUTERS ONLY)

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows Server
      2003, Datacenter Edition, connect to the shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
        Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or
        later, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.

======================================================================
3.0   STARTING SETUP FOR AN UPGRADE
======================================================================


If you are upgrading to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can start Setup from the CD or from a network.

For information about providing a mass storage driver or a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file during Setup, see "Providing a Mass
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.

IMPORTANT: To run Setup for an upgrade, you must be a member of the
Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is joined
to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to
perform this procedure. As a security best practice, if you start
Setup from a computer running Windows 2000, consider using Run as.

Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands
or programs using a different security context. For example, you can
log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running
Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
search for "runas."

>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to display a
      dialog box.

   2. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>> TO START AN UPGRADE FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files by either
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
      the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, connect to the shared
      folder or drive that contains the Setup files.

   3. Run Setup.exe.
 
   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
4.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
Itanium architecture-based computer. For an explanation of how
to start Setup on an x86-based computer, see "Starting Setup on
an x86-based Computer" earlier in this text file.

In computers with the Itanium processor or the Itanium 2 processor,
the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is the interface between a
computer's firmware, hardware, and operating system. The EFI defines a
new disk partition style called a GUID partition table (GPT), which is
available only for Itanium architecture-based computers. The
installation partition on an Itanium architecture-based computer must
be on a GPT disk. Setup automatically specifies GPT for the disk used
for installation. You can still read and write to master boot record
(MBR) volumes, which are common to most PCs, but you cannot install
on one.

You cannot access GPT disks locally from an x86-based computer. If
you want to move a disk from an Itanium architecture-based computer to
an x86-based computer, use an MBR disk. This is true regardless of
whether the disk is basic or dynamic.

Before installing, verify that you are using the correct version of
the firmware. For more information, refer to the hardware
manufacturer's documentation.

   IMPORTANT: Itanium architecture-based computers require a
   minimum 100-MB FAT partition for the operation of the EFI. This
   EFI system partition is created automatically during Setup, and it
   stores programs and information files that the EFI uses to start
   the operating system. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

Setup also creates a Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR), which is
required by the operating system. The size of this partition depends
on the size of the hard disk. On drives less than 16 GB in size, the
MSR is 32 MB. On drives greater than or equal to 16 GB, the MSR is
128 MB. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

>>>TO START SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER

   1. Immediately after turning on the computer, insert the Setup CD
      in the CD-ROM drive.

   2. When the EFI Boot Manager menu appears, select the CD-ROM
      option.

   3. When prompted, press any key to start from the CD-ROM.
 
   4. Follow the on-screen Setup instructions.


======================================================================
5.0   PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================


This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can
view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows
     2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family, use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With
     Windows NT 4.0, before starting unattended Setup, apply Service
     Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD
     for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, in the CD-ROM
     drive and open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM
     drive, change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT,
     Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family, insert the Setup CD for Windows
     Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, in the CD-ROM drive, and open
     the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change to
     the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the command
     options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition;
     the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition; or the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD
     for the 64-bit version of the product in the CD-ROM drive and
     open the command prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type
     cmd). Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64
     directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see Datactr1.TXT for
important background information about issues such as partitions, file
system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name resolution.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass
   Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.

If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer,
see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this text file.


Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
Edition, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or specify a
partition on which you want to install. You can create a partition
from the available unpartitioned space, specify an existing partition,
or delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk
space for the new installation. If you specify any action that will
cause information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm
your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for
New Installations" in Datactr1.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased.

Performing a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on a partition that contains another operating
system overwrites the existing operating system.


Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, to use
multiple languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking
Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify regional and language options by
clicking Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Choosing a Licensing Mode
-------------------------
Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see Datactr1.TXT. If you are unsure which mode to use,
select "Per Server," because you can change once from "Per Server"
mode to "Per Device or Per User" mode at no cost.


Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in Datactr1.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."


Setting the Administrator Account Password
-------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep
   a strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help
   and Support.


Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.


Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and
Setup, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" in
Datactr1.TXT. For additional information about TCP/IP configuration,
see Help and Support Center as well as the Windows Deployment and
Resource Kits for the Windows Server 2003 family. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on
     your network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP
     provides an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your
     network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option called
     Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using
     APIPA, complete the network configuration after Setup, because
     a server using APIPA can communicate only with other computers
     using APIPA on the same network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of
     APIPA, see "IP Addresses" in Datactr1.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS AND WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).
  
   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the
      address of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.


Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
in Datactr1.TXT.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.


Choosing Server Components
--------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.


======================================================================
6.0   PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE WINDOWS
      SERVER 2003 FAMILY
======================================================================


After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:


Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.


How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.


Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number
     (toll-free, wherever possible) is displayed on your screen. When
     you call the number, a customer service representative asks for
     the Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The
     customer service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.


Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.


---------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.

7.0   PREPARING FOR UPGRADING CLUSTERING
======================================================================


The following sections provide information on the initial steps
needed for upgrading clustering:

   * Understanding the basic preparations needed.

   * Confirming your hardware compatibility with Windows
     Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   * Choosing from the available options for upgrading.


----------------------------------
7.1   Other Sources of Information
----------------------------------
Following are sources of additional information on server clusters
and other topics related to high availability:

   * For more information on server clusters, you can view Help and
     Support Center topics for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
     Edition, on the Web. One way to view this information is to
     work from any computer that has Internet access (regardless
     of the operating system running on that computer). You can view
     Help and Support Center topics at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

     Another way to view this information is to open Help and Support
     Center. To do this, go to a computer running Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, click Start, and then click Help
     and Support.

   * For more information about deployment and management of servers
     and server clusters, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits
     on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

   * For information about backup and recovery planning, change
     management, configuration management, and other concepts
     related to operational best practices, see resources in the
     Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). To see
     a description of ITIL, go to:

        http://www.itil.co.uk/

        Note: Web addresses can change, so you might be unable to
        connect to the Web site mentioned here.


----------------------------
7.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
Ensure that your entire cluster solution (including your drivers as
well as your hardware) is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


--------------------------------------
7.3   Options for Upgrading Clustering
--------------------------------------
You have several options when upgrading clustering. You can:

   * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000,
     possibly through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see
     "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition," later in this
     text file.

   * Perform a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, and install the Cluster service at the same
     time. For more information about this option, see "Installing
     on Cluster Nodes" in Datactr4.TXT.


--------------------------------------------
7.4   Quorum Resource Options for an Upgrade
--------------------------------------------
With clusters running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource (the
resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run). These options are:

   * Single node server cluster

   * Single quorum device server cluster 

   * Majority node set

Before upgrading, refer to "Quorum Resource Options" in Datactr4.TXT
to learn more about these options.


======================================================================
8.0   UPGRADING A CLUSTER FROM WINDOWS 2000 TO
      WINDOWS SERVER 2003, DATACENTER EDITION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on cluster nodes, you might be able to perform a
rolling upgrade of the operating system. In a rolling upgrade, you
sequentially upgrade the operating system on each node, making sure
that one node is always available to handle client requests. When you
upgrade the operating system, the Cluster service is automatically
upgraded also. A rolling upgrade maximizes availability of clustered
services and minimizes administrative complexity. For more
information, see the next section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade, and
understand the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your
clustered resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
in Datactr3.TXT. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster
nodes if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to
Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" in Datactr3.TXT.


-------------------------------
8.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
-------------------------------
This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the sections that follow this section.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which a fewer number
of nodes handle the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not
have to recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains
intact during the upgrade process.

The four phases of a rolling upgrade are described in the
following section.


8.1.1  Phases of a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------
A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2:

Phase 1: Preliminary
--------------------
Each node runs Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with the following
hardware and software:

   * A cluster storage unit using Fibre Channel, not SCSI. Fibre
     Channel is the only type of cluster storage on the list of
     compatible hardware for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
     Edition. (Note that SCSI can be used for a two node cluster
     with Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, not
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.)

   * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
     Windows 2000 Datacenter Server).

   * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more
     information, see the application documentation, and "Resource
     Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
-----------------------
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups
while you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

You are now running a mixed-version cluster. A mixed-version cluster
is a cluster in which the nodes are running different versions of the
operating system. Although mixed-version clusters are supported by
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, they are not the optimal
configuration. It is recommended that you upgrade all nodes to the
same operating system by completing the final two phases of the
rolling upgrade.

When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2
-----------------------
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final
--------------
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to add nodes to the cluster, add them after
   completing the rolling upgrade. Before adding additional nodes,
   ensure that your entire cluster solution is compatible with
   products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).


8.1.2  Performing a Rolling Upgrade
-----------------------------------
For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section "How Rolling Upgrades Work." To perform the following
procedure, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the
local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate
authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the
Domain Admins group might be able to perform this procedure. As a
security best practice, consider using Run as to perform this
procedure. Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to
start commands or programs using a different security context. For
example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and, without
logging off, run a command as a member of the Administrators group. To
find more information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server
running Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab
and then search for "runas."

   IMPORTANT: For information about what resources are supported
   during rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   and "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

>>>TO PERFORM A ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000 and use
      resources that are supported during a rolling upgrade, as
      described in "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource
      Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible
      with Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   3. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to
      upgrade first.

   4. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

   5. In the right pane, click Active Groups.

   6. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu,
      click Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

      The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
      moved and restarted on another node. After the groups are moved,
      one node is idle, and the other nodes handle all
      client requests.

   7. Use Setup for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, to
      upgrade the paused node from Windows 2000. (For information
      about running Setup, see the sections on starting Setup, earlier
      in this text file.)

      Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused
      node and automatically installs clustering for
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. The node
      automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of the upgrade
      process, but is still paused and does not handle any
      cluster-related work.

         Note: As you begin the setup process, you will receive a
         warning message about using the tempdrive option for Setup.
         Provided you have followed the preceding steps, you can click
         OK and proceed with Setup without using this option.

   8. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
      perform validation tests such as confirming that the operating
      system recognizes your network connections and, using Device
      Manager, ensuring that the operating system recognizes all of
      your storage devices.

   9. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and
      then on the File menu click Resume Node.

         Note: When you use Cluster Administrator for the first time
         on the upgraded node, Cluster Administrator will prompt you
         to "Open connection to cluster." In the "Cluster or server
         name" field, type a period (.). This will connect you to the
         cluster on the local upgraded node. Although you can connect
         to the cluster by typing the cluster name, if you do so you
         will be connected to the cluster on the Windows 2000 node and
         then will be required to respond to several warning messages.
 
  10. Repeat the preceding steps for the remaining nodes.

======================================================================
1.0 PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================
This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for a new installation.

----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.

----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you
back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the
current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up
files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the
hard disk of another computer on the network.

-------------------------------
1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.

======================================================================
2.0 STARTING SETUP
======================================================================
This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting.

For important information to help you make the initial choices offered 
by Setup, see WebSrv1.TXT. For information about unattended Setup and 
other options available when you start Setup, see "Planning for 
Unattended Setup" later in this text file.

---------------------------------------------------
2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
-------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by checking 
the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows 
Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) 
before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the 
bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts will 
guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain 
access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying 
that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of 
controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup,
and press F6 when you are prompted.

2.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
-------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.

--------------------------------
2.2   Methods for Starting Setup
--------------------------------
The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD" and
"Starting a New Installation from a Network," explain how to start
Setup for a new installation.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.

2.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
---------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures.

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or
   MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the Setup
   process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. To enable
   disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can
   use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the
   documentation for Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.
 
   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running
Windows NT 4.0, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>> TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from the 
CD-ROM drive. Using this method, you can perform an installation on a
computer that does not have an operating system, although you can also
use this method on computers that have operating systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.

2.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, from a network, you
either share the files directly from the CD or copy them to a shared
folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, WEB EDITION, FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows Server 2003,
      Web Edition, connect to the shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
        Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or later,
        Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.

3.0 PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================
This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing Installations"
in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the Windows
Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With Windows NT 4.0,
     before starting unattended Setup, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation): See "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD for
     Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, in the CD-ROM drive and
     open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change
     to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     insert the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, in
     the CD-ROM drive, and open the command prompt. Then, change to
     the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the command
     options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium architecture-based
     computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition; the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or the 64-bit version of 
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD for
     the 64-bit version of the product in the CD-ROM drive and open the
     command prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then,
     change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

======================================================================
4.0 ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================
After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup files 
are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see WebSrv1.TXT for
important background information about issues such as partitions, file
system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name resolution.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass
   Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.
   If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
   Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer,
   see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this text file.

Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Web Edition
------------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, a
dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or specify a partition
on which you want to install. You can create a partition from the
available unpartitioned space, specify an existing partition, or
delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk space
for the new installation. If you specify any action that will cause
information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see the section on planning partitions for new
installations in WebSrv1.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased. Performing a new installation of Windows
   Server 2003, Web Edition, on a partition that contains another
   operating system overwrites the existing operating system.

Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, to use multiple
languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking Regional
and Language Options in Control Panel.

Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in WebSrv1.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."

Setting the Administrator Account Password
------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep a
   strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help
   and Support. 

Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.

Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and Setup,
see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" in WebSrv1.TXT.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on your
     network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP provides
     an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your network, Setup
     will use a limited IP addressing option called Automatic Private
     IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using APIPA, complete the
     network configuration after Setup, because a server using APIPA
     can communicate only with other computers using APIPA on the same
     network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of APIPA,
     see "IP Addresses" in WebSrv1.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS AND WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).
  
   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the address
      of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.

Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.

======================================================================
5.0 CONFIGURING YOUR WEB SERVER
======================================================================
The Web Interface for Remote Administration is an HTML-based
application used to configure and manage the server from a remote
client. Individual servers, entire server farms, and multiple sites
per server can be managed from a single remote workstation.

The Web Interface for Remote Administration provides a simple means
of performing common Web server configuration tasks including:

   * Creating and deleting Web sites

   * Configuring network settings

   * Managing local user accounts

   * Restarting the Web server

5.1   Choosing Server Components
--------------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.

======================================================================
6.0 PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE
    WINDOWS SERVER 2003 FAMILY
======================================================================
After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:

Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.

How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.

Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number (toll-free,
     wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you call the
     number, a customer service representative asks for the
     Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer
     service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.

Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.

---------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.

on cluster nodes. Datactr2.TXT provides additional information about
upgrading on cluster nodes. Datactr4.TXT provides information about
installing on cluster nodes.

     7.0    Preparing for Upgrading Clustering
     8.0    Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Windows
            Server 2003, Datacenter Edition
     8.1    How Rolling Upgrades Work

Sections in this text file about upgrading on cluster nodes:
------------------------------------------------------------
     Section 8 cont'd. from Datactr2.TXT:
     8.2    Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
     8.3    Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
     8.4    Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000


--------------------------------------
8.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
--------------------------------------
There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restriction is as follows:

   * You cannot mix x86-based and Itanium architecture-based
     computers within the same cluster. Therefore you cannot perform
     a rolling upgrade from an x86-based computer to an Itanium
     architecture-based computer.
     

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. The operation of a
mixed-version cluster is complicated if a resource type that you add
to the cluster is supported in one version of the operating system but
not the other. For example, the Cluster service in
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, supports the Generic
Script resource type. However, older versions of the Cluster service
do not support it.

A mixed-version cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node
running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, but not on a
node running Windows 2000. The Cluster service transparently sets the
possible owners of new resource types to prevent these resources from
failing over to a Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In
other words, when you view the possible owners of a new resource type,
a Windows 2000 node will not be in the list, and you will not be able
to add this node to the list. If you create such a resource during the
mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups
containing those resources will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node. 

In order for a mixed-version cluster to work, the different versions
of the software running on each node must be prepared to communicate
with one another. This requirement leads to several basic restrictions
on the rolling-upgrade process.

   * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the
     cluster manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
     information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
     later in this text file.

   * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
     cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
     system, do not change the settings of resources (for example,
     do not change the settings of a printer resource).

If the preceding restriction cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.


-----------------------------------------------
8.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
-----------------------------------------------
Although the Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes the resources that are supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from
Windows 2000" later in this text file.


======================================================================
RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DHCP               DHCP is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.

IIS                IIS 6.0 is not supported during a rolling upgrade.
                   When upgrading a cluster that contains an IIS
                   resource, you must follow the procedure
                   described in "Upgrades That Include an IIS
                   Resource" later in this text file.

IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.

Local Quorum       Supported during rolling upgrades.

MSDTC              Supported during rolling upgrades. However,
                   avoid creating or deleting the MSDTC resource
                   while you are operating as a mixed version
                   cluster. Instead create the MSDTC resource
                   before starting the upgrade on any node, or wait
                   until the upgrade is complete on all nodes. For
                   more information on mixed version clusters, see
                   "How Rolling Upgrades Work" in Datactr2.TXT and
                   "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in
                   this text file.

Message Queuing    Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported
(also known as     during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
MSMQ)              that includes Message Queuing, see "Upgrades
                   That Include Message Queuing Resources" later in
                   this text file.

Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.

NNTP Service       NNTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
                   You must remove any NNTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades

Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard port monitor ports. See the
                   following section, "Upgrades that Include a
                   Print Spooler Resource."

SMTP Service       SMTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
                   You must remove any SMTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Time Service       Time Service is not supported in Windows
                   Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. You must remove
                   any Time Service resources prior to upgrading.

WINS               WINS is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

Other resource     See Relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder of the
types              Setup CD for Windows Server 2003,
                   Datacenter Edition. Also see the product
                   documentation that comes with the application or
                   resource.


When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.


8.3.1  Upgrades That Include a Print Spooler Resource
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) of printers
on cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Port Monitor ports). For
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

   * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
     Print Spooler resource.

   * Avoid adding new printers while you are performing a rolling
     upgrade. If you do add a new printer, when you install the
     drivers for that printer, be sure to install both the driver
     for Windows 2000 and the driver for Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, on all nodes.

   * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
     check them. Printing preferences in Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, will not necessarily correspond to document
     defaults for the same printer in Windows 2000. This can be
     affected by differences in the drivers for the two operating
     systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.


--------------------------------------------------------
8.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
--------------------------------------------------------
Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including:

   * Internet Information Services (IIS)

   * DHCP

   * WINS

Special procedures, described in the sections that follow, must be
used when performing an upgrade of a cluster that contains these
resources. In addition to the resource types listed previously, you
might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling
upgrades. Be sure to read Relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder of the
Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, as well as
the product documentation that comes with the application or resource.


8.4.1  Upgrades That Include an IIS Resource
--------------------------------------------
IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. To upgrade a
clustered IIS resource, you must replace the existing IIS resource
with a Generic Script Resource. You have two options to do this; you
can perform each of the steps as described in the following procedure,
or you can use a script that is supplied with
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, which automates many of
the steps. The instructions for using the script are described in the
second procedure.


Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade Procedures
------------------------------------------------------------
To perform any of the cluster upgrade procedures in this text file,
you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local
computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.
If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins
group might be able to perform these procedures. As a security best
practice, consider using Run as to perform the upgrade procedures. Run
as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or
programs using a different security context. For example, you can log
on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running
Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
search for "runas."

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 WITHOUT USING THE PROVIDED SCRIPT ON A
   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the
      resources that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and
      clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the details
      pane, click the resource that you want to remove, then on the
      File menu, click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions
      on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general
      information about Setup, see Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource on the
      cluster that you are upgrading, create a DTC resource for this
      cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Datacenter Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

   4. On the Windows 2000 node, note the dependencies of the IIS
      instance resource. Note resources that depend on the IIS
      resource and also note what resources IIS itself is
      dependent on.

   5. Take the group containing the IIS instance resource offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups folder. In
      the details pane, click the group containing the IIS resource,
      then on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   6. Remove any dependencies on the IIS instance resource by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder. For
      each resource that is dependent on the IIS instance resource, in
      the details pane, click the resource you want to modify, then on
      the File menu, click Properties. On the Dependencies tab, click
      Modify. Click the IIS resource in the Dependencies list and
      click the left arrow to move it to the Available resources list.

   7. Delete the IIS instance resource by using Cluster Administrator
      and clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the
      details pane, click the IIS instance resource, then on the File
      menu, click Delete.

   8. Move the group to a node that is running Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, and create a Generic Script
      resource by following the procedure documented in "Checklist:
      Creating a clustered IIS Web or FTP service." To find this
      procedure, click Start on an upgraded node (one of the nodes
      running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition), click
      Help and Support, and click Availability and Scalability. Click
      Windows Clustering, click Server Clusters, click Checklists:
      Creating Server Clusters, then click Checklist: Creating a
      clustered IIS Web or FTP service. You can also view this Help
      and Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

      As part of this step, recreate the dependencies of the Generic
      Script resource identical to those of the now deleted IIS
      resource. Make everything that was dependent on the IIS resource
      dependent instead on the Generic Script resource. Also make the
      Generic Script resource dependent on everything that IIS was
      dependent on.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type is
      not supported in Windows 2000.

   9. Start the W3SVC service on this node and set the W3SVC service
      to start automatically. For more information about the W3SVC,
      see the topic titled "Internet Information Services (IIS)
      security." To find this topic, click Start on the upgraded node,
      click Help and Support, and click Internet Services. Click
      Internet Information Services, then click Internet Information
      Services (IIS) security. You can also view this Help and
      Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

  10. Bring the group containing the new Generic Script resource
      online by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups
      folder. In the details pane, click the group containing the
      Generic Script resource, then on the File menu, click
      Bring Online.

  11. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

  12. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Once the upgrade is complete, start the W3SVC service
      on this node and set the W3SVC service to start automatically.
    
         Note: Although suitable for most situations, it is not
         necessary to upgrade all nodes but one in the first step.
         Depending on your availability needs and the number of nodes
         in your cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding
         steps by performing steps three through 11 after only one,
         two or three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one
         and three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring
         it online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.

>>>TO USE THE PROVIDED SCRIPT TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 ON A
   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the resources
      that are not supported by Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the
      Resource folder in the console tree. In the details pane, click
      the resource that you want to remove, then on the File menu,
      click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions on Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general information
      about Setup, see Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource on the
      cluster that you are upgrading, create a DTC resource for this
      cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Datacenter Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

   4. On an upgraded node, open a Command Prompt and navigate to the
      %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv directory.

   5. Type:

      iis_switch cluster_name [group_name]

      where

      * cluster_name

        is the name of a physical node in the cluster that has been
        upgraded or the name of a virtual server.

      * group_name

        is optional, because the script will, by default, upgrade all
        IIS web and FTP resources in the cluster. However, if you want
        to upgrade only one particular group, you can specify the name
        of that resource group.

           IMPORTANT: The resource group that includes the IIS
           resource must be on the Windows 2000 node when you run
           the script.

        The script includes a step that will bring the group with the
        newly created Generic Script resource online. However, the
        script will only bring the group online if all resources in
        the group were online before the script was run. If the group
        was only partially online or was offline prior to the script
        being run, the script will take the entire group offline and
        will not bring any resources back online after the upgrade.
  
        Once the script completes, the newly created resource might
        immediately fail. This is because the W3SVC service is
        disabled. You can correct this problem by completing the
        following step.

   6. Once the script completes, take the newly created Generic Script
      resource offline, then start the W3SVC service on the upgraded
      node and set the W3SVC to start automatically. For more
      information about the W3SVC, see the topic titled "Internet
      Information Services (IIS) security." To find this topic, click
      Start on the upgraded node, click Help and Support, and click
      Internet Services. Click Internet Information Services, then
      click Internet Information Services (IIS) security. You can also
      view this Help and Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

   7. Bring the Generic Script resource online. 
 
   8. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

   9. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Once the upgrade is complete, start the W3SVC service
      on this node and set the service to start automatically.

  10. If appropriate, add the final upgraded node to the Possible
      Owners list for the newly created Generic Script resource by
      using the Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource
      folder. In the details pane, click the Generic Script resource.
      On the File menu, click Properties. On the General tab, next to
      Possible owners, click Modify.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type
      is not supported in Windows 2000.

         Notes: The script will not upgrade IIS resources that are in
         the cluster group. If you have IIS resources that are in the
         cluster group, you can instead use the procedure "To upgrade
         from Windows 2000 without using the provided script on a
         cluster that includes an IIS resource" earlier in this
         text file.

         The script sets the script path as
         %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\ by default. You can modify
         this path if necessary. 
  
         Although suitable for most situations, it is not necessary to
         upgrade all nodes but one in the first step. Depending on
         your availability needs and the number of nodes in your
         cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding steps
         by performing steps two through four after only one, two or
         three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one and
         three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring it
         online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.
    
    
8.4.2  Upgrades That Include Message Queuing Resources
------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported during a
rolling upgrade.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 ON A CLUSTER THAT CONTAINS MESSAGE
   QUEUING RESOURCES

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Take all of the Message Queuing cluster resources offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder.
      In the details pane, click each Message Queuing resource, then
      on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   3. For each Message Queuing resource, take the Network Name
      resource that depends on it offline also.

   4. Upgrade all of the nodes from Windows 2000 to Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Prior to upgrading, be sure to
      remove the resources that are not supported by
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Do this by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource folder in the
      console tree. In the details pane, click the resource that you
      want to remove, then on the File menu, click Delete.

   5. Bring the Network Name resources back online. Ensure that the
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource is online,
      then bring the Message Queuing resources online.


8.4.3  Last Node Rolling Upgrades
---------------------------------
If you have other resources on your cluster such as DHCP and WINS
that are not fully supported during a rolling upgrade and are not
described by other technology specific procedures listed previously
(such as IIS), you can perform a "last node rolling upgrade."

Last node rolling upgrades are similar to standard rolling upgrades.
In a last node rolling upgrade, you upgrade all nodes except the node
that contains the unsupported resources. After all other nodes are
upgraded, you then upgrade the final node containing the
identified resources.

Last node rolling upgrades are a way to accommodate resources that
cannot fail over to an older operating system from a node running
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Be aware that these
resources can, however, fail over the other way, that is, from the
older operating system to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO PERFORM A LAST NODE ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   3. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition, and remove those resources. Do this by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource folder in the
      console tree. In the details pane, click the resource that you
      want to remove, then on the File menu, click Delete.

   4. Again using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades and
      are not covered by other technology specific upgrade procedures
      described previously.

   5. Move all of the resources identified in the previous step to a
      single node by double-clicking the Groups folder in the Cluster
      Administrator console tree. Click the group that contains the
      resource and then in the File menu, click Move Group.

   6. Upgrade the operating system on each of the nodes that is not
      hosting the resources moved in the previous step. 

   7. Move all of the resources that you moved in the earlier steps
      from the node that has not been upgraded to one of the
      newly upgraded nodes.

   8. Once all of the resources have been moved, upgrade the final
      node. After you upgrade, close the Manage Your Server dialog
      box if it is displayed. 

         Note: It is not mandatory to move all of these resources to
         a single node and upgrade that node last. However, following
         the procedure as described will typically give you the
         highest availability of the resources that do not support
         rolling upgrades.

5.1   Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a
      Windows NT 4.0 Domain
-----------------------------------------------------
There are three stages to the process of upgrading servers in a
domain where all the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0:

Basic preparations
------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out
before upgrading servers to a product in the Windows Server 2003
family, such as confirming hardware compatibility and reviewing the
partitioning of the disks on the servers. For more information, see
"Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows NT Domain"
later in this text file.

Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
involves understanding the server roles available, as well as deciding
when to upgrade domain controllers in relation to member servers:

   * The server roles available for servers running Windows NT are
     slightly different than for servers running Windows Server 2003.
     Also, in contrast with servers running Windows NT, you can change
     the role of a server running Windows Server 2003 without 
     reinstalling the operating system. For more information, see 
     "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from 
     Windows NT" later in this text file.

   * If the first server running Windows NT 4.0 you upgrade is a
     member server, many features become available immediately. For
     information about reasons for upgrading a particular member
     server early in the process, see "Features Available with the
     Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this
     text file.

   * When you upgrade the primary domain controller, many Active
     Directory features become available (in addition to all the
     other features in the Windows Server 2003 family). For
     information about how these features can simplify
     administration, see "Features Available with the First Domain
     Controller Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text
     file.

     However, the upgrade to Active Directory also involves some
     advance planning. For information about the planning necessary
     before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning DNS for
     the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0" later
     in this text file.

        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers
        running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary
        domain controller first.


Performing backups and carrying out the upgrade process
-------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning the
upgrades, such as ensuring that you have applied Service Pack 5 or
later, and performing backups:

   * For information about the preparations to make just before
     beginning the upgrade, see "Applying the Service Pack,
     Performing Backups, and Other Preparations" later in this text
     file.

   * For information about choices to make during the upgrade of the
     primary domain controller, see "Running the Active Directory
     Installation Wizard After Upgrading the Primary Domain
     Controller" later in this text file.

   * For information on Help and Support Center topics about Active
     Directory, see "Learning About Active Directory After the First
     Server is Upgraded" later in this text file. You can also view
     the topics about Active Directory at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

   * For guidelines regarding further upgrades, see "Completing
     Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0" later in this text file.
     

--------------------------------------------------------
5.2   Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a
      Windows NT Domain
--------------------------------------------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out to
lay the groundwork for upgrading servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how these
preparations fit into the overall process of the upgrade, see "Stages
in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: If you have servers or client computers that run
   Windows NT 3.51, it is recommended that you install or upgrade to
   a newer operating system on all these computers, or retire them
   from operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade
   domain controllers running Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon
   validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running
   Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of
   version differences between computers, simplifying management and
   troubleshooting.


Compatibility check
-------------------
Check to see whether the applications and hardware on your systems
are compatible with products in the Windows Server 2003 family,
and then update or replace them as necessary. For important details
about how to do this, see "Hardware Compatibility" and "Important
Files to Review" in Server1.TXT.


Review partition sizes, especially on domain controllers
--------------------------------------------------------
Review the partitions on the servers to make sure there is plenty of
free space available for the Windows Server 2003 operating system to
run. It is especially important to allow plenty of free space on
domain controllers, because the existing user accounts database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten when Active Directory
functionality is added. For information about the disk requirements
for the operating system, see "System Requirements" in Server1.TXT.


Review file systems on server partitions
----------------------------------------
You must have at least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It
is recommended that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers
in the domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security
features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can
be protected only by the permissions set on the shared folder, not on
individual files, and there is no software protection against local
access to the partition. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System for the Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting
a Partition to Use NTFS" in Server3.TXT.


Service pack
------------
Obtain Service Pack 5 or later, because it is necessary for
the upgrade.


Mirror sets or other disk sets
------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you must
prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with Volume,
Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" later in this text
file.


5.2.1  Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets
       with Parity
------------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Windows NT 4.0, you could
create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with
parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using the
dynamic disk technology introduced with Windows 2000, you can use
similar technologies, with the added flexibility of being able to
extend disk volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. Any volume sets, mirror
sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity that you created with
Windows NT 4.0 are not supported in Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, although they were supported to a limited extent in
Windows 2000.

If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you must
choose one of the following methods.


For a mirror set, break the mirror
----------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a mirror set
and you want to run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard
Edition, on that computer, first back up the data (as a safeguard --
the data will not be erased) and then break the mirror. Ensure that
you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required before running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. Then run Setup.


For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up the
data and delete the set
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a volume
set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup
for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer,
first back up the data. Next, delete the set (which will delete the
data). Ensure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required
before running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.
Then run Setup.

After running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition,
you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up data as necessary,
and make use of the volume options shown in the table later in this
section. For more information about dynamic disks, see Help and
Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.


If necessary, use the Ftonline support tool
-------------------------------------------
The preceding methods are the recommended methods for preparing to
run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
computer that contains a volume set, mirror set, stripe set, or stripe
set with parity created with Windows NT 4.0. However, if you do not
use these methods and you must access one of these sets after running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, you can use the
Ftonline tool. The Ftonline tool is part of the Windows
Server 2003 family Support Tools. For more information, see topics on
Support Tools and on Ftonline in Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click
Help and Support.


Types of Multidisk Volumes on Dynamic Disks
-------------------------------------------
The disk sets described in the previous section have different names
in the Windows Server 2003 family than they had in
Windows NT 4.0:


======================================================================
WINDOWS NT 4.0 NAME            WINDOWS SERVER 2003 FAMILY NAME
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume set                     Spanned volume on a dynamic disk
Mirror set                     Mirrored volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set                     Striped volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set with parity         RAID-5 volume on a dynamic disk


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.3   Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
      Windows NT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a list of basic guidelines to use when planning
server roles and the order of server upgrades in a domain where all
the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how
this planning fits into the overall process of the upgrade, see
"Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0
Domain" earlier in this text file.

Use the following guidelines when planning server roles and the order
of server upgrades from Windows NT:

   * Familiarize yourself with the slight differences between the
     naming of server roles for servers running Windows NT as compared
     to servers running Windows Server 2003:

     * In Windows NT, there are two kinds of domain controllers, the
       primary domain controller, which is limited to one per domain
       and contains a read-write database, and the backup domain
       controller, which is not limited in number and contains a
       read-only database.

     * For domain controllers running Windows Server 2003, there is 
       only one kind of domain controller, without a "primary" or
       "backup" designation. All domain controllers contain matching
       copies of the user accounts and other Active Directory data 
       in a given domain, and provide read-write access to that data.

     * In addition to domain controllers, the possible roles for
       either operating system include member server, which belongs
       to a domain but does not contain a copy of the Active Directory
       data, and stand-alone server, which belongs to a workgroup
       instead of a domain.

   * Note that in contrast with Windows NT, you can change the role of
     a server without rerunning Setup. However, as a general practice,
     it is best to plan the roles ahead of time and change them only
     as necessary.

   * As was true with Windows NT, a domain must have at least one
     domain controller, but it is recommended that a domain have
     multiple domain controllers for resilience in the handling of
     logon requests and directory updates.

   * If the features you need most are not Active Directory features,
     you can focus on upgrading member servers first. For information
     about reasons for upgrading a particular member server early in
     the process, see "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any
     Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * If the features you need most are Active Directory features,
     focus on upgrading domain controllers first, and carry out the
     advance planning that is necessary for this part of the upgrade.
 
        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers
        running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary domain
        controller first.

For information about the features that come with Active Directory,
see "Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade in a
Windows NT Domain" later in this text file. For information about the
planning necessary before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning
DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0"
later in this text file.

   * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
     access server that is a member server, it is recommended that you
     upgrade it before the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a
     server is dependent on domain controllers for user information,
     and therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers
     are upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security
     permissions in Active Directory so that the remote access server
     running Windows NT can read user attributes from the domain
     controllers running products in the Windows Server 2003
     family. For more information, see the Windows Server 2003
     Deployment Kit.


5.3.1  Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a
       Windows NT Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, you
might want to focus on upgrading the member servers in your
Windows NT 4.0 domain. For information about reasons to upgrade the
domain controllers, see "Features Available with the First Domain
Controller Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * Management tools:
  
     Microsoft Management Console
     Plug and Play
     Device Manager
     Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
     Support for Universal Serial Bus
     Enhanced Backup utility

   * File system support: The version of NTFS in the Windows
     Server 2003 family includes support for disk quotas, the ability
     to defragment directory structures, and compressed network I/O.

   * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and
     Windows Script Host.

   * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
     choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
     enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
     Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
     over an intranet or the Internet.

   * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
     support as compared to Windows NT.

   * Security: Encrypting File System.


5.3.2  Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade
       in a Windows NT Domain
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, all of
which are features of Active Directory, focus on upgrading the primary
domain controller, as opposed to member servers. (The first domain
controller that you upgrade must be the primary domain controller. It
is recommended that you also upgrade backup domain controllers.) For
information about the DNS planning necessary before beginning the
upgrade of domain controllers running Windows NT, see "Planning DNS
for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0" later in
this text file.

For information about reasons to upgrade member servers, see
"Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT
Domain" earlier in this text file.

After running Setup, you can also display topics about Active
Directory and other feature areas in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support).

   Note: When a domain controller is upgraded, it has all the features
   of the Windows Server 2003 family, which means it has all the
   features in the following list, plus the features in "Features
   Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT Domain"
   earlier in this text file.

When you upgrade a domain controller to run a Windows Server 2003
operating system instead of Windows NT, many Active Directory features
become available in the domain:

   * Simplified management of network-resource information and
     user information.

   * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
     a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active Directory.
   
   * Security and authentication features, including support for
     Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer 3.0, and Transport Layer
     Security using X.509v3 certificates.

   * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
     simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
     devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
     they want. You can take advantage of synchronization support
     through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
     Protocol (LDAP), and work with directory consolidation
     requirements specific to your applications.

   * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make it
     easier to configure and manage applications and other
     directory-enabled network components.

   * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
     scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
     technology and advanced replication techniques to
     speed performance.

   * Use of Internet standards, including access through Lightweight
     Directory Access Protocol and a namespace based on the Domain
     Name System (DNS).

   * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful
     development environment.

   * Additional Active Directory features.


5.3.3  Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running
       Windows NT 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system used for
locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. This
section describes the planning for DNS that is recommended before you
upgrade to Active Directory, that is, before you upgrade the primary
domain controller in a Windows NT domain to become a domain controller
running Windows Server 2003.

DNS is the name resolution service used by Active Directory. Products
in the Windows Server 2003 family can support both the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) common in Windows NT networks, and DNS.
You must deploy DNS to support Active Directory. You can choose to
migrate from WINS to DNS or configure your new DNS infrastructure to
support your current WINS infrastructure.

For the upgrading of a network with one to five servers and 100 or
fewer clients (which is the size of network discussed in this text
file series), only a simple DNS plan is needed, because there will be
no parent or child domains. (For information about upgrading networks
with more than five servers, see the Windows Server 2003
Deployment Kit.) DNS names consist of name labels separated by
periods. A simple DNS domain name for a Windows Server 2003
family domain could take the form domainname.ext where ext is an
established "top-level domain" type such as com or org. With a domain
name of that form, the form of a computer name in the domain would be:

computername.domainname.ext

When you upgrade the primary domain controller in a Windows NT 4.0
domain (the primary domain controller must be upgraded first, before
backup domain controllers), you will be offered several different
options for the handling of DNS. If there is no DNS server available
to work with Active Directory, you will be offered, by default, the
option of installing DNS on the domain controller you are upgrading
(formerly the primary domain controller). In a network with one to
five servers, the simplest approach is to accept this default. Then,
after completing the upgrade of the server on which DNS was installed,
take note of its static IP address, and configure other computers to
send any DNS requests to that IP address. For additional basic
information about DNS and how to configure it during Setup, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in Server3.TXT. For more detailed information
about DNS, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits as well as
Help and Support Center. One way to view these sources of information
is to work from any computer that has Internet access (regardless of
the operating system running on that computer). You can view these
sources of information at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Another way to view information about DNS is to go to a computer
running any product in the Windows Server 2003 family, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.


------------------------------------------------------------
5.4   Performing Backups and Carrying out Upgrades of Domain
      Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning an upgrade
from Windows NT 4.0, such as ensuring that you have applied Service
Pack 5 or later, and performing backups. During the upgrade, there are
a few choices to make for the upgrade of a network of two to five
servers (a network within the size of those discussed in this text
file series). The following sections describe these final preparations
and provide guidelines for making choices.

Before beginning this stage of the upgrade process, be sure to review
"Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows NT Domain"
and "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
Windows NT" earlier in this text file.


5.4.1  Applying the Service Pack, Performing Backups, and Other
       Preparations
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before beginning an upgrade of servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0, apply an appropriate Service
Pack, perform backups, and consider whether to remove a backup domain
controller temporarily from the network:

   * Be sure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later to the
     servers. You must apply Service Pack 5 or later before you can
     begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0.

   * As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your
     servers, it is recommended that you back up each server before
     upgrading it. Also be sure to review "Preparing Your System for
     an Upgrade" in Server4.TXT.

   * If you are preparing to upgrade the primary domain controller, to
     protect your existing network integrity, consider removing a
     backup domain controller temporarily from the network. To do
     this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a backup domain
     controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the user
     accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
     cable. After the upgrade of your primary domain controller to
     become a domain controller running Windows Server 2003 (you must
     upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
     system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
     controller if necessary. However, in the course of an uneventful
     upgrade, you would not and could not promote the Windows NT
     backup domain controller to primary domain controller. Instead,
     you would continue the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting
     the disconnected server and upgrading it.


5.4.2  Running the Active Directory Installation Wizard After
       Upgrading the Primary Domain Controller
-------------------------------------------------------------
To upgrade the primary domain controller to become a domain
controller running Windows Server 2003, you must first run Setup to
upgrade the operating system. After the operating system is installed,
you can run the Active Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on
the screen the first time you log on). This section provides guidelines
for making choices in the Active Directory Installation Wizard when
upgrading the primary domain controller.

For information about preparations necessary before beginning the
upgrade, see "Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows
NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file. For information about
starting Setup, see Server4.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers running
   Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary domain
   controller first.

The following table shows the choices that are recommended when
running the Active Directory Installation Wizard on the server that
was formerly the primary domain controller. These recommendations are
for a network of two to five servers (a network within the size of
those discussed in this text file series):

                              Support Center.


During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three
important items: the database containing user accounts and other
Active Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (Sysvol)
folder. The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition
(FAT, FAT32, or NTFS); the database can expand by as much as a factor
of ten from the size it had with Windows NT, so allow plenty of room
for it. (Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The
system volume folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information
about NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System for the
Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to
Use NTFS" in Server3.TXT.)


5.4.3  Learning About Active Directory After the First Server
       is Upgraded
-------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as the first server is upgraded, you can open Help and
Support Center and read information about how to use Active Directory.
To open Help and Support Center, click Start, and then click Help and
Support. The following list provides suggestions about information to
review:

   * Additional information about upgrading from a Windows NT 4.0
     domain.

   * "New ways to do familiar tasks," that is, a table that compares
     the way you completed domain tasks with Windows NT with the way
     you complete those tasks with products in the Windows Server
     2003 family.

   * Domains and forests.
  
   * Functional levels (domain functional level and forest functional
     level). After upgrading the last domain controller in a Windows
     NT domain to become a domain controller running Windows Server
     2003, you have the option of changing functional levels, as
     described in the Active Directory topics.

   * The global catalog and also operations master roles, which you do
     not have to take action on as part of the upgrade, but might want
     to learn about.

You can also view the same topics about Active Directory on the
Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

For information about deployments and upgrades in multiple domains or
in domains larger than five servers, see the Windows Server 2003
Deployment Kit. You can view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits
on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/


5.4.4  Completing Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------
After you upgrade your primary domain controller and ensure that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, you can begin the upgrade of any
backup domain controllers. (You can upgrade member servers at any
time.)

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Before beginning the upgrade of each
backup domain controller, make sure that at least one domain
controller running Windows Server 2003 is available on the network,
because the user accounts and other Active Directory data will be
copied from the domain controllers that have already been upgraded.
Start and test each server on the network to ensure that it is 
functioning to your satisfaction before upgrading another backup
domain controller.

An upgraded domain controller will appear as a Windows NT 4.0 primary
domain controller to servers and client computers running
Windows NT 4.0. However, it is recommended that you complete the
upgrade of all servers in the domain relatively quickly (rather than
allowing a long delay). This reduces the number of version differences
between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting, and
also strengthens security.

If you have a remote access server that is a member server, it is
recommended that you upgrade it before the last domain controller is
upgraded. For more information, see "Planning Server Roles and the
Order of Server Upgrades from Windows NT" earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
6.0   DECISIONS TO MAKE FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

What licensing mode to use
--------------------------
With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you can choose
between two licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User

   * Per Server

Per Device or Per User mode requires a separate Client Access License
(CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server running a product
in the Windows Server 2003 family. Per Server mode requires a
separate CAL for each concurrent connection to a server. For more
information about licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in
this text file.

Whether you want to be able to choose between different operating
systems each time you start the computer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" in Server3.TXT.

What file system to use on the installation partition
-----------------------------------------------------
You can potentially choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that
supports Active Directory, which includes many important features
such as domains and domain-based security. However, it might be
necessary to have a FAT or FAT32 partition on a basic disk, if you
must set up the computer so that it sometimes runs Windows
Server 2003, Standard Edition, and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or
an earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a
File System for the Installation Partition" in Server3.TXT.

What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing
partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system.
Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters
(for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" in Server3.TXT.

How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
in Server3.TXT.

Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for
an administrator to control access to resources and keep track of
users. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" in Server3.TXT.


======================================================================
7.0   CHOOSING A LICENSING MODE
======================================================================


Products in the Windows Server 2003 family support two
licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User
 
   * Per Server

If you choose the "Per Device or Per User" mode, each device or user
that accesses a server running a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL).
With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of
servers running products in the Windows Server 2003 family. This
is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more
than one server running products in the Windows Server 2003
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words,
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with
five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at
any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five
clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not
need any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access
servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network
clients for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server, because you
can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at
no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can
display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support). If you use Terminal Server,
be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.

======================================================================
1.0   UPGRADES COMPARED TO NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation.
Upgrading is either replacing Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (with
Service Pack 5 or later) with a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, or replacing
Microsoft Windows 2000 with a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family. Installing, in contrast with
upgrading, means completely removing the previous operating system, or
installing a product in the Windows Server 2003 family on a disk
or disk partition with no previous operating system.

The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between
an upgrade and a new installation:

Points to consider for an upgrade:
----------------------------------

   * With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing
     users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained.

   * With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and
     applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk,
     however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before
     beginning an upgrade.

   * Before planning to perform an upgrade, see "Operating Systems
     from Which You Can Upgrade" later in this text file.

   * If you are upgrading in a domain that includes domain controllers
     running Windows 2000, be sure to read "Upgrades in a Domain
     Containing Windows 2000 Domain Controllers" later in this
     text file.

   * If you are upgrading in a domain where all domain controllers run
     Windows NT 4.0, be sure to read "Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
     Domain" in Server2.TXT.

   * If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as
     before, be sure to review applications information in
     Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD). Also, for the
     most recent information on compatible applications for products
     in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Points to consider for a new installation:
------------------------------------------

   * If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new
     installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve
     (compared to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you
     the opportunity to modify the size or number of disk partitions,
     to make them match your requirements more closely.

   * If you want to practice careful configuration management, for
     example, for a server where high availability is important, you
     might want to perform a new installation on that server instead
     of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on which the
     operating system has been upgraded several times in the past.

   * It is possible to install Windows Server 2003,
     Standard Edition, and also allow the computer to sometimes
     run another operating system. Setting up the computer this way,
     however, presents complexities because of file system issues.
     For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
     Contain More Than One Operating System" in Server3.TXT.

        Note: If you want to install Windows Server 2003,
        Standard Edition, on a computer that previously ran an
        operating system released before Windows 2000:

           * Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard
             Edition, on a compressed drive unless the drive was
             compressed with the NTFS file system compression
             utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume
             before running Setup on it.
 
           * If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set,
             mirror set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and
             you want to run Setup for Windows Server 2003,
             Standard Edition, on that computer, you must prepare the
             disk set first. For details, see "Working with Volume,
             Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" in
             Server2.TXT.


--------------------------------------------------
1.1   Operating Systems from Which You Can Upgrade
--------------------------------------------------
If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Windows Server
2003, Standard Edition, into the same folder as the currently
installed operating system. You can upgrade to Windows Server
2003, Standard Edition, from the following versions of Windows:

   * Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 5 or later

   * Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, with Service Pack
     5 or later

   * Windows 2000 Server.

     Remote Storage is not included on Windows Server 2003,
     Standard Edition. If you are using Windows 2000 Server with
     Remote Storage, you cannot upgrade to Windows Server 2003,
     Standard Edition. You can, however, upgrade to Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, because Remote Storage is
     included in this product.

     If you have Windows 2000 Server with the Remote Storage component
     installed, but you are not using Remote Storage, you can remove
     the component (through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel) and
     then upgrade to Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.

If you have Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition, you can upgrade
to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, but not Windows
Server 2003, Standard Edition. Before upgrading from Windows NT 4.0,
you must apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   Note: If you have a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0, you
   cannot upgrade directly to a product in the Windows Server
   2003 family. You must first upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 and apply
   Service Pack 5 before upgrading to a product in the Windows
   Server 2003 family.


======================================================================
2.0   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
======================================================================


Before upgrading or installing your server, make sure that you have
chosen hardware that supports Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition.


-------------------------
2.1   System Requirements
-------------------------
To ensure adequate performance, make sure that computers on which you
install or upgrade to Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, meet
the following requirements:

   * One or more processors with a recommended minimum speed of 550
     MHz (minimum supported speed is 133 MHz). A maximum of four
     processors per computer is supported. Processors from the Intel
     Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible
     processors are recommended.

   * 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum (128 MB
     minimum supported; 4 gigabytes (GB) maximum).

   * A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to
     accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have
     flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is
     recommended that you allow considerably more space than the
     minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately 1.25
     GB to 2 GB. The larger amount of space is required if you are
     running Setup across a network instead of from a CD-ROM, or if
     you are upgrading on a FAT or FAT32 partition (NTFS is the
     recommended file system).

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than other upgrades, because the
     existing user accounts database can expand by as much as a factor
     of ten during the upgrade, as Active Directory functionality
     is added.

        Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described
        in the previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual
        hard disk space used for the operating system will be more
        than the free space required for Setup, because of space
        needed for the paging file, for any optional components you
        install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and
        other Active Directory information. The usual size for the
        paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information
        about the paging file, optional components, user accounts, and
        information stored in Active Directory, see Help and Support
        Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
        Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

   * VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher
     recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other
     pointing device.

     As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard,
     you can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor that is
     designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For
     details, see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For CD-ROM installation:

   * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

   * One or more network adapters and related cables that are designed
     for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For details,
     see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

For additional hardware-based functionality:

   * Appropriate hardware for the functionality you require. For
     example, if you require sound, you must have a compatible sound
     card with speakers or headphones, and if you plan to support
     network clients, the servers and clients must have appropriate
     network adapters and cables. For details about your hardware, see
     the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:
  
        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


----------------------------
2.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
One of the most important steps to take before upgrading or
installing your server is to confirm that your hardware is compatible
with products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can do this
by running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD or
by checking the hardware compatibility information at the Windows
Catalog Web site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility,
check to see that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers
and an updated system BIOS.

Regardless of whether you run a preinstallation compatibility check,
Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of
an installation or upgrade and displays a report if there
are incompatibilities.


Running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the
Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually
begin an installation or upgrade. To run the check, insert the Setup
CD in the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts
for checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to
download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run
the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that
you allow the download.

For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see
"Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later
in this text file.

Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD
in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:

d:\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly

where d represents the CD-ROM drive.


Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the
Microsoft Web site
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed
for products in the Windows Server 2003 family is to check the
hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog
at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Note that one type of hardware no longer supported is the
Micro Channel bus.


Checking drivers and system BIOS
--------------------------------
Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS. The device
manufacturers can help you obtain these items. For information about
the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see "Understanding ACPI BIOS" later in
this text file.

Finally, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you
are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly
to the standards, consider taking a device inventory of the hardware
devices in your computer. For more information, see the next section,
"Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play."


2.2.1  Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This section describes steps you can take if the devices in your
computer do not use Plug and Play technology. For important
information about hardware compatibility (including the compatibility
of devices), be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file. For specific information
about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the manufacturer,
see "Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process" in Server4.TXT.

Products in the Windows Server 2003 family include Plug and Play
technology so that devices (for example, video and network adapters)
can be automatically recognized by the operating system, configuration
conflicts are avoided, and you do not have to specify each device's
settings by hand. However, if you have devices that do not use Plug
and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not
implemented exactly to the standards, you might want to take steps to
avoid device configuration conflicts. This section describes steps you
can take, if you choose, to understand your device configuration
before running Setup.

To take an inventory of your devices, use the existing operating
system to obtain the current settings, such as memory address and
interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices. For example, with
Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view settings (on the
Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also choose
to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen while
starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when
prompted.

At the beginning of an upgrade, the Setup program automatically takes
a device inventory as well. For devices that do not use Plug and Play,
or that are not implemented exactly to Plug and Play standards, taking
your own inventory helps prevent the following difficulties:

   * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
     the Setup program might not be able to resolve the conflict. To
     prevent this, you can take one of two approaches.

     You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and
     re-install it afterward. For information about installing and
     configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and
     Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
     Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

     As an alternative, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
     memory addresses before running Setup, so that each adapter's
     settings are unique.

   * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
     Setup to detect or enumerate them, Setup might receive
     indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you might
     need to remove these devices before running Setup, and re-install
     and configure them afterward. For information about installing
     and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and
     Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
     Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, and you decide to take a
device inventory before starting Setup.

                 slots


2.2.2  Understanding ACPI BIOS
------------------------------
The basic input/output system (BIOS) is a set of software through
which the operating system (or Setup) communicates with the computer's
hardware devices. The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
(ACPI) is the current standard for the way the BIOS works. Products in
the Windows Server 2003 family support not only ACPI-compliant
BIOS versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced
power management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions provided.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

   * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
     restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
     particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
     "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

   * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, check your
     hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.


2.2.3  Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which
you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain
the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files.
Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that
update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built
into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be
replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file)
and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the
time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use
Dynamic Update when running Setup.

Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and
easy to use:

   * The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web
     site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are
     important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available
     through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not
     significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update.

   * Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required
     for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines
     your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and
     no information is saved. The only purpose is to select
     appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps
     the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary
     drivers are downloaded to your hard disk.

   * You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation
     compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup
     itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for
     running Setup. For information about running the compatibility
     check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

   * You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for
     this requires several steps. For a brief description of
     unattended Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" in
     Server4.TXT. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with
     unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see
     "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the
     Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
     Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can
use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to:

http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/


======================================================================
3.0   IMPORTANT FILES TO REVIEW
======================================================================


At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup,
familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found in the \Docs
folder on the CD for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.

This file contains important usage information about topics such as
application compatibility, hardware, or networking. Also familiarize
yourself with information about hardware compatibility for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
"Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

For the most recent information on compatible applications for
products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


======================================================================
4.0   UPGRADES IN A DOMAIN CONTAINING WINDOWS 2000 DOMAIN CONTROLLERS
======================================================================


If you are upgrading servers in a domain containing Windows 2000
domain controllers, there are a few points to keep in mind. The
following points are the most important:

   * The first step in planning the upgrade of a particular server is
     to check the compatibility of the hardware with products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
     "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

   * Before you upgrade the first domain controller in a domain where
     one or more domain controllers run Windows 2000, or add a domain
     controller running a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family, you must prepare the domain (and the forest in which it
     is located) using a simple tool on the Setup CD for Windows
     Server 2003, Standard Edition. For information, see "Preparing
     for Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows 2000 Domain
     Controllers" later in this text file.

     Before preparing the domain (and the forest in which it is
     located), it is recommended that you apply Service Pack 2 or
     later to all domain controllers running Windows 2000.

   * If you have Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 installed on
     a server, when you upgrade the operating system, IIS is upgraded
     to IIS 6.0. However, for application compatibility, IIS runs in
     IIS 5.0 isolation mode after the upgrade. For more information
     about IIS isolation modes, see the IIS 6.0 Help.

   * After upgrading the first server, you can read topics in Help and
     Support Center about the features that are most useful to you in
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

     One concept to read about is domain and forest functional levels,
     which are levels of Active Directory functionality related to the
     mix of operating system versions on your domain controllers. As
     you complete domain controller upgrades and reduce the number of
     different operating system versions running on them, you can
     adjust the domain and forest functional levels appropriately.

     You can view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

     To view Help and Support Center on a server running Windows Server 2003,
     after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
     and Support.

If you have servers running Windows NT, also review the
following points:

   * Before running Setup, it is recommended that you review the file
     systems and partitions that exist on the server. You must have at
     least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It is recommended
     that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers in the
     domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security
     features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared
     folder can be protected only by the permissions set on that
     shared folder, not on individual files, and there is no software
     protection against local access to the partition. For more
     information, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use
     NTFS" in Server3.TXT.

   * If some of your domain controllers run Windows 2000 and some run
     Windows NT, it is recommended that you upgrade the Windows NT 
     domain controllers as soon as is practical, to reduce the number
     of version differences between computers, simplify management and
     troubleshooting, and strengthen security.

   * Before you begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0, you must apply
     Service Pack 5 or later.

   * If you have servers or client computers that run Windows NT 3.51,
     it is recommended that you install or upgrade to a newer
     operating system on all these computers, or retire them from
     operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade
     domain controllers running Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon
     validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running
     Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of
     version differences between computers, simplifying management and
     troubleshooting.

After the domain and forest are prepared, there are two stages in the
upgrade of a domain controller. First you run Setup to upgrade the
operating system and then, when Setup is complete, you run the Active
Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on the screen the first
time you log on).


---------------------------------------------------
4.1   Preparing for Upgrades in a Domain Containing
      Windows 2000 Domain Controllers
---------------------------------------------------
Before beginning the first domain controller upgrade in a domain
where one or more domain controllers run Windows 2000, you must first
prepare the domain and the forest in which it is located. After
preparing the domain, you can begin the domain upgrade through either
of the following approaches:

   * Upgrade an existing domain controller to a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. (Be sure to check hardware
     compatibility first, as described in "Hardware Compatibility"
     earlier in this text file.)

     If you attempt to upgrade the first domain controller and you
     have not yet prepared the domain and the forest, Setup stops and
     a pop-up provides instructions.

   * Install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a member
     server in the domain, and start the Active Directory Installation
     Wizard to change the member server into a domain controller.

     If you install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
     member server in the domain and start the Active Directory
     Installation Wizard, but you have not yet prepared the domain and
     the forest, the wizard stops and a pop-up provides instructions.

For additional background information about this type of domain
upgrade, see the previous section, "Upgrades in a Domain Containing
Windows 2000 Domain Controllers."

>>>TO PREPARE THE DOMAIN AND FOREST BEFORE UPGRADING A DOMAIN
   CONTAINING WINDOWS 2000 DOMAIN CONTROLLERS

   1. Before carrying out this procedure, it is recommended that you
      apply Service Pack 2 or later to all domain controllers running
      Windows 2000.

   2. Locate the server that is the schema master and the server that
      is the infrastructure master (they might be the same server).

      In a network of two to five servers (a network within the size
      of those discussed in this text file series), the schema master
      is usually the server on which you first installed or upgraded
      to Windows 2000. For information about identifying the schema
      master or the infrastructure master, search Windows 2000 Help
      for the topics called "Identify the schema master" and "Identify
      the infrastructure master." To view Windows 2000 Help, click
      Start and then click Help. You can also view
      Windows 2000 Help at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/server/help/

   3. Back up the schema master.

      You can back up other servers as well, as an appropriate part of
      preparing for upgrading, but be sure to back up the schema
      master just before taking the next step.

   4. Disconnect the schema master from the network and do not
      reestablish the connection until step 9 in this procedure.

   5. On the schema master, while Windows 2000 is running, insert the
      Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in the
      CD-ROM drive.

   6. Open a command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive, and change to
      the \i386 folder on the CD.

   7. On the schema master, at the command prompt, type

      adprep /forestprep

         Note: To perform this step, you must be a member of the
         Enterprise Admins group and the Schema Admins group in
         Active Directory, or you must have been delegated the
         appropriate authority. As a security best practice, consider
         using Run as. Run as is a secondary logon method that you can
         use to start commands or programs using a different security
         context. For example, you can log on as a member of the Users
         group and, without logging off, run a command as a member of
         the Enterprise Admins group. To find more information in
         Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running Windows 2000,
         click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
         search for "runas."

   8. After the preceding command has finished on the schema master,
      confirm that the preparation of the forest was successful. Steps
      you can take to do this include:

      * Confirm that no error messages have appeared.

      * Run any domain controller diagnostic tools that are available,
        for example, Dcdiag.exe, one of the tools available from the
        \Support\Tools folder on the Setup CD. Keep in mind that
        replication errors will appear while the domain controller is
        disconnected from the network.

      * Open Event Viewer and check the system log for errors or
        unexpected events.

   9. Evaluate the information you gathered in the previous step and
      choose accordingly:

      * If adprep /forestprep ran without errors, reconnect the schema
        master to the network and continue with the next step of this
        procedure.

      * If adprep /forestprep ran but error messages provided
        instructions for additional steps to take, follow the
        instructions and then return to the confirmation process
        described in the previous step.

      * If adprep /forestprep did not run successfully, or diagnostic
        tools such as Dcdiag.exe revealed a significant problem,
        restore the schema master from backup and investigate the
        corrective steps necessary so that adprep /forestprep can be
        run successfully.

  10. If the schema master is a different computer from the
      infrastructure master, wait for the changes made by adprep
      /forestprep to replicate from the schema master to the
      infrastructure master. Wait at least fifteen minutes, but allow
      longer (half a day or a day) if the schema and infrastructure
      masters are not at the same site. If you try to perform the
      domain preparation on the infrastructure master before the
      changes have replicated, Adprep will provide an error message
      to notify you that more time is needed.

  11. On the infrastructure master, while Windows 2000 is running,
      insert the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Standard
      Edition, in the CD-ROM drive.

  12. Open a command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive, and change to
      the \i386 folder on the CD.

  13. On the infrastructure master, type

      adprep /domainprep

         Note: To perform this step, you must be a member of the
         Domain Admins group or the Enterprise Admins group in
         Active Directory, or you must have been delegated the
         appropriate authority. As a security best practice, consider
         using Run as. Run as is described in the previous note in
         this section.

  14. After the preceding command has finished on the infrastructure
      master, confirm that the preparation of the domain was
      successful. Steps you can take to do this include:

      * Confirm that no error messages have appeared.

      * Run any domain controller diagnostic tools that are available.

      * Open Event Viewer and check the system log for errors or
        unexpected events.

  15. Evaluate the information you gathered in the previous step and
      choose accordingly:

      * If adprep /domainprep ran without errors, continue with the
        next step of this procedure.

      * If adprep /domainprep ran but error messages provided
        instructions for additional steps to take, follow the
        instructions and then return to the confirmation process
        described in the previous step.

  16. Wait for the changes made by adprep /domainprep to replicate
      from the infrastructure master to other domain controllers. Wait
      at least fifteen minutes, but allow longer (half a day or a day)
      if you have a domain controller in a remote site. If you begin
      to upgrade one of the other domain controllers before the
      changes have replicated, a pop-up message will notify you that
      more time is needed.

After you complete this procedure, you can leave your domain
controllers running Windows 2000 for an indefinite length of time, or
you can begin the domain controller upgrade immediately.

   Note: For information about upgrading multiple domains, see the
   Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit.

               Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition
                    Setup Text Files, Part 4 of 4:
                     Installing on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************


This part of the text file series provides information about
installing on cluster nodes. With Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that users have
constant access to important server-based resources. With clustering,
you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one server.
If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to
provide service (a process known as failover). Critical applications
and resources remain continuously available.

For more information about the deployment of servers, see the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The following list of headings can help you find the information that
applies to you. For information about planning an upgrade or a new
installation, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about running Setup,
see Datactr2.TXT. For information about upgrading on cluster nodes,

For information about installing on cluster nodes, see the sections
that follow. These sections can help you learn about:

   * Sources of additional information

   * How to plan for a new cluster installation

   * Decisions that you need to make regarding your quorum resource
     (the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
     configuration data and that must always be available for the
     cluster to run)


-------------------------------------
1.1   Important Information to Review
-------------------------------------
To prepare for installing clustering:

   * Review Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT for general information
     about Setup.

   * As described in Datactr1.TXT, confirm that your hardware,
     including your cluster storage, is compatible with products in
     the Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * In addition, check with the manufacturer of your cluster storage
     hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need to use the
     hardware with Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

        IMPORTANT: You must ensure that hardware in your entire
        cluster solution is compatible with products in the
        Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
        "Cluster hardware and drivers" in the "Planning for Cluster
        Installation" section later in this text file.

Before carrying out cluster installation, you need to plan hardware
and network details.

   CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device, before creating
   a cluster, when you turn on the computer and start the operating
   system, it is very important that only one node has access to the
   cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted.
   To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but
   one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example, LUN
   masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster
   disks, before creating the cluster. Once the Cluster service is
   running properly on one node, the other nodes can be installed and
   configured simultaneously. Each node of your cluster must be
   running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

In your planning, review the following items:

Cluster hardware and drivers
----------------------------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family. Confirm that your
entire cluster solution is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).

Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
installing cluster hardware. Otherwise the cluster storage could
be corrupted.

To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

Network adapters on the cluster nodes
-------------------------------------
In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
adapter will carry. The following list provides details about the
types of communication that an adapter can carry:

   * Only node-to-node communication (private network). This implies
     that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry
     other communication.

     For node-to-node communication, you connect the network adapter
     to a private network that is used exclusively within the cluster.
     Note that if the private network uses a single hub or network
     switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential point of
     failure in your cluster.

     The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet but you can use
     virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
     nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
     must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
     appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective
     of the Windows operating system running on the nodes. To avoid
     single points of failure, use independent VLAN hardware for the
     different paths between the nodes.

     If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, it is
     a best practice for the adapters for those networks to use static
     IP addresses instead of DHCP.

   * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network). This
     implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
     carry other communication.

   * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
     network). When you have multiple network adapters per node, a
     network adapter that carries both kinds of communication can
     serve as a backup for other network adapters.

   * Communication unrelated to the cluster. If a clustered node also
     provides services unrelated to the cluster, and there are enough
     adapters in the cluster node, you might want to use one adapter
     for carrying communication unrelated to the cluster.

The nodes of a cluster must be connected by two or more local area
networks (LANs); at least two networks are required to prevent a
single point of failure. A server cluster whose nodes are connected by
only one network is not a supported configuration. The adapters,
cables, hubs, and switches for each network must fail independently.
This usually implies that the components of any two networks must be
physically independent.

At least two networks must be configured to handle "All
communications (mixed network)" or "Internal cluster communications
only (private network)."

The recommended configuration for two adapters is to use one adapter
for the private (node-to-node only) communication and the other
adapter for mixed communication (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster
communication). Do not use teaming network adapters on the
private network.

If you use fault tolerant network adapters, create multiple private
networks instead of a single fault-tolerant network.

Do not configure a default gateway or DNS or WINS server on the
private network adapters. Do not configure private network adapters to
use name resolution servers on the public network; otherwise a name
resolution server on the public network might map a name to an IP
address on the private network. If a client then received that IP
address from the name resolution server, it might fail to reach the
address because no route from the client to the private network
address exists.

Configure WINS and/or DNS servers on the public network adapters. If
Network Name resources are used on the public networks, set up the DNS
servers to support dynamic updates; otherwise the Network Name
resources may not fail over correctly. Also, configure a default
gateway on the public network adapters. If there are multiple public
networks in the cluster, configure a default gateway on only one
of these.

When you use either the New Server Cluster Wizard or the Add Nodes
Wizard to install clustering on a node that contains two network
adapters, by default the wizard configures both of the network
adapters for mixed network communications. As a best practice,
reconfigure one adapter for private network communications only. For
more information, see "Change how the cluster uses a network" in Help
and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start,
and then click Help and Support. You can also view Help and Support
Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Consider choosing a name for each connection that tells what it is
intended for. The name will make it easier to identify the connection
whenever you are configuring the server.

Manually configure the communication settings, such as Speed, Duplex
Mode, Flow Control and Media Type of each cluster network adapter. Do
not use automatic detection. You must configure all of the cluster
network adapters to use the same communication settings.

The adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different
subnet masks.

Do not use the same IP address for two network adapters, even if they
are connected to two different networks.

   Note: Confirm that your entire cluster solution is compatible with
   the products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For more
   information, see "Cluster hardware and drivers" earlier in this
   section. If you use a crossover cable to implement a private
   network, when the cluster is created on the first node the second
   node should be turned on but stopped in the BIOS or at the startup
   menu. In this state, the Media Sense feature of Windows might not
   recognize the network adapter as connected. If you continue
   creating the cluster, the crossover cable will be detected when
   you start the second node. The network will be established in the
   default mode, which is mixed. You can then change the network mode
   to private using Cluster Administrator.

Cluster IP address
------------------
Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
DHCP for this address.

IP addressing for cluster nodes
-------------------------------
Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the individual cluster
nodes. Each network adapter on each node requires IP addressing. It is
a best practice to assign each network adapter a static IP address. As
an alternative, you can provide IP addressing through DHCP. If you use
static IP addresses, set the addresses for each linked pair of network
adapters (linked node-to-node) to be on the same subnet.

Note that if you use DHCP for the individual cluster nodes, it can
act as a single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster
nodes so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses,
temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary unavailability
of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use DHCP, evaluate ways
to ensure availability of DHCP services, and consider the possibility
of using long leases for the cluster nodes. This helps to ensure that
they always have a valid IP address.

Cluster name
------------
Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is the
name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. (The
actual applications running on the cluster typically have different
network names.) The cluster name must be different from the domain
name, from all computer names on the domain, and from other cluster
names on the domain.

Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes
---------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
service
----------------------------------------------------------------
To install and configure the cluster service, you must be using an
account that is in the local Administrators group on each node. As you
install and configure each node, if you are not using an account in
the local Administrators group, you will be prompted to provide the
logon credentials for such an account.

Cluster service user account
----------------------------
Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the name
and password under which the Cluster service will run. You need to
supply this user name and password during cluster installation.

It is best if the Cluster service user account is an account not used
for any other purpose. If you have multiple clusters, set up a unique
Cluster service user account for each cluster. The account must be a
domain account; it cannot be a local account. However, do not make
this account a domain administrator account because it does not need
domain administrator user rights.

As part of the cluster setup process, the Cluster service user
account is added to the local Administrators group on each node. As
well as being a member of the local Administrators group, the Cluster
service user account requires an additional set of user rights:

   * Act as part of the operating system.
  
   * Back up files and directories.

   * Adjust memory quotas for a process.

   * Increase scheduling priority.

   * Log on as a service.

   * Restore files and directories.

These user rights are also granted to the Cluster service user
account as part of the cluster setup process. Be aware that the
Cluster service user account will continue to have these user rights
even after all nodes are evicted from the cluster. The risk that this
presents is mitigated by the fact that these user rights are not
granted domain wide, but rather only locally on each former node.
However, remove this account from each evicted node if it is no longer
needed.

Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the Cluster service
user account (follow your organization's policies for password
renewal).

Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint and
log files)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan on setting aside a volume on your cluster storage for holding
important cluster configuration information. This information makes up
the cluster quorum resource, which is needed when a cluster node stops
functioning. The quorum resource provides node-independent storage of
crucial data needed by the cluster. For important information on
quorum resource options, see "Quorum Resource Options" later in this
text file.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. It is
recommended that you do not store user data on any volume in the
quorum resource.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions
   formatted as NTFS (they can be either compressed or uncompressed).
   Partition and format all disks on the cluster storage device
   before adding the first node to your cluster. Do not configure
   them as dynamic disks, and do not use spanned volumes
   (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks. For the
   64-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
   cluster disks on the cluster storage device must be partitioned
   as MBR and not as GPT disks.


-----------------------------
1.4   Quorum Resource Options
-----------------------------
With server clusters on Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can now choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource
(the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run). The first is a single node server cluster, which has been
available in the past and continues to be supported. A single node
cluster is often used for development and testing and can be
configured with, or without, external cluster storage devices. For
single node clusters without an external cluster storage device, the
local disk is configured as the cluster quorum device.

The second option is a single quorum device server cluster, which has
also been available in earlier Windows versions. This model places the
cluster configuration data on a shared cluster storage device that all
nodes can access. This is the most common model and is recommended for
most situations. You might choose the single quorum device model if
all of your cluster nodes are in the same location and you want to
take advantage of the fact such a cluster continues supporting users
even if only one node is running.

The third option, which is new for Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, is a "majority node set." A majority node set is
a single quorum resource from a server cluster perspective; however,
the cluster configuration data is actually stored on multiple disks
across the cluster. The majority node set resource ensures that the
cluster configuration data is kept consistent across the different
disks. In the majority node set model, every node in the cluster uses
a directory on its own local system disk to store the cluster
configuration data. If the configuration of the cluster changes, that
change is reflected across the different disks. Be aware that it is
also possible to have shared storage devices in a majority node set
cluster. The exact configuration depends on the requirements for your
installation.

Only use a majority node set cluster in targeted scenarios, such as:

   * Geographically dispersed cluster: A cluster that spans
     multiple sites.

   * Eliminating single points of failure: Although when using a
     single cluster storage device the quorum disk itself can be made
     highly available via RAID, the controller port or the Host Bus
     Adapter (HBA) itself may be a single point of failure.

   * Clusters with no shared disks: There are some specialized
     configurations that need tightly consistent cluster features
     without having shared disks.

   * Clusters that host applications that can fail over, but where
     there is some other, application-specific way, to replicate or
     mirror data between nodes: For example, this model is useful if
     you use database log shipping for keeping a SQL database state up
     to date.

Do not configure your cluster as a majority node set cluster unless
it is part of a cluster solution offered by your Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM), Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or Independent
Hardware Vendor (IHV).


1.4.1  Cluster Model Considerations
-----------------------------------
Before implementing your cluster, consider what type of quorum
resource solution you plan to use. Take into consideration the
following differences between single quorum device clusters and
majority node set clusters.

   Note: The following information is presented to help you make
   basic decisions about the placement and management of your cluster
   nodes and quorum resource. It does not provide all the details
   about the requirements for each cluster model, or how each model
   handles failover situations. If you are not sure which model to
   use or where you want to place your cluster nodes, install
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster
   node, then consult the on-line help cluster documentation in Help
   and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
   Edition. See "Using a Majority Node Set" later in this text file
   for more information on how to access Help and Support Center.


Node failover behavior
----------------------
The failover behavior of the majority node set is significantly
different from the behavior of the single quorum device model:

   * Using the single quorum device model, you can maintain cluster
     availability with only a single operational node.

   * If you use a majority node set, more than half, or (Number of
     nodes configured in the cluster/2) + 1 nodes must be operational
     to maintain cluster availability. The following table shows the
     number of node failures that a given majority node set cluster
     can tolerate yet continue to operate:

   ===================================================================
   NUMBER OF NODES       NUMBER OF NODE            NUMBER OF NODES
   CONFIGURED IN THE     FAILURES ALLOWED          NEEDED TO CONTINUE
   CLUSTER               BEFORE CLUSTER FAILURE    CLUSTER OPERATIONS
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1                     0                         1
   2                     0                         2
   3                     1                         2
   4                     1                         3
   5                     2                         3
   6                     2                         4
   7                     3                         4
   8                     3                         5


Geographic considerations
-------------------------
You would commonly use a single quorum resource model if all nodes in
your cluster will be in the same geographical location. As part of
this requirement, your nodes must be connected to the same physical
storage device.

A majority node set on the other hand would typically be appropriate
if you have geographically dispersed nodes. The cluster configuration
data is stored locally on each node on a file share that is shared out
to the other nodes on the network. However, those shares must always
be accessible or nodes can fail.

There are other specific requirements for geographically dispersed
clusters, including the requirement that round-trip latency of the
network between cluster nodes be a maximum of 500 milliseconds. For
information on cluster solutions that meet all requirements for a
geographically dispersed cluster, refer to hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Hardware
--------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family of products. For
both cluster models, confirm that your system or hardware components,
including your cluster disks, are compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


1.4.2  Using a Majority Node Set
--------------------------------
This section tells how to obtain additional information about the
majority node set model. For a description of a majority node set,
see "Quorum Resource Options" earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: Before implementing a majority node set, it is highly
   recommended that you read the online clustering documentation in
   Help and Support Center to thoroughly understand all the
   considerations, requirements, and restrictions for each type of
   quorum resource solution.

======================================================================
2.0   Beginning the Cluster Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================


The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

   IMPORTANT: Carefully review your network cables after connecting
   them. Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example,
   private network connected to public).


2.1   Initial Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI When Using a
      Fibre Channel Shared Storage Device or No Shared Storage Device
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Turn on a single node. Leave all other nodes turned off.

   * During this initial installation phase, remain in the BIOS or
     Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration process, and
     do not allow the operating system to start. While viewing the
     BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that you can scan the
     bus and see the drives from the active cluster node. On a 32-bit
     computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer, use the EFI configuration screens.
     Consult the instructions from your manufacturer to determine
     whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically
     or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press
     specific keys to access them. Follow the manufacturer's
     instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI
     configuration process.


2.2   Final Steps to Complete the Installation
----------------------------------------------
If you have not already installed Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster node, install it before
proceeding. For information about decisions you must make, such as
decisions about licensing, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about
running Setup, see Datactr2.TXT.

After you complete the BIOS or EFI configuration, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and complete the configuration of the
Cluster service using Cluster Administrator.

With the Cluster Administrator New Server Cluster Wizard, you can
choose between Typical (full) configuration and Advanced (minimum)
configuration options. Typical configuration is appropriate for most
installations and results in a completely configured cluster. Use
the Advanced configuration option only for clusters that have complex
storage configurations that the New Server Cluster Wizard cannot
validate or for configurations in which you do not want the cluster
to manage all of the storage. The following examples describe
each situation:

   * In some complex storage solutions, such as a fiber channel
     switched fabric that contains several switches, a particular
     storage unit might have a different identity on each computer in
     the cluster. Although this is a valid storage configuration, it
     violates the storage validation heuristics in the New Server
     Cluster Wizard. If you have this type of storage solution, you
     might receive an error when you are trying to create a cluster
     using the Typical configuration option. If your storage
     configuration is set up correctly, you can disable the storage
     validation heuristics and avoid this error by restarting the New
     Server Cluster Wizard, selecting the Advanced configuration
     option instead.

   * On particular nodes in a cluster, you may want to have some disks
     that are to be clustered and some disks that are to be kept
     private. The Typical configuration option configures all disks as
     clustered disks and creates cluster resources for them all.
     However, with the Advanced configuration option, you can keep
     certain disks private because this configuration creates a
     cluster in which only the quorum disk is managed by the cluster
     (if you chose to use a physical disk as the quorum resource).
     After the cluster is created, you must then use Cluster
     Administrator to add any other disks that you want the cluster to
     manage.

If you are using a shared storage device: Before creating a cluster,
when you turn the computer on and start the operating system, it is
very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk.
Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the
corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node,
or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective
presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks before creating
the cluster. Also, before starting the installation of the second and
subsequent nodes, ensure that all disks that are to be managed by the
cluster have disk resources associated with them. If these disks do
not have disk resources associated with them at this time, the disk
data will be corrupted because the disks will not be protected and
multiple nodes will attempt to connect to them at the same time.

>>>TO SET UP YOUR CLUSTER USING CLUSTER ADMINISTRATOR

   1. Open Cluster Administrator by clicking Start, pointing to
      Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking
      Cluster Administrator.

   2. In the Open Connection to Cluster dialog box that appears, in
      Action, select Create new cluster, then click OK.

   3. The New Server Cluster Wizard appears. Click Next to continue.

   4. Upon completion of the New Server Cluster Wizard, click Finish.

         IMPORTANT: During the cluster creation process (using the
         Quorum button on the Proposed Cluster Configuration page)
         you will be able to select a quorum resource type (that is,
         a Local Quorum resource, Physical Disk or other storage
         class device resource, or Majority Node Set resource). For
         information on how these quorum resource types relate to the
         different cluster models, see "Quorum Resource Options"
         earlier in this text file. Do not use Manage Your Server or
         the Configure Your Server Wizard to configure cluster nodes.

======================================================================
1.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR AN UPGRADE 
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for an upgrade.


----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Help for the operating system that you
are running.


----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before upgrading, it is recommended that you back up your current
files, including anything containing configuration information, for
example, the System State and the system and boot partitions. You can
back up files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or
the hard disk of another computer on the network.


--------------------------------------------------------------
1.3   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for an Upgrade
      (Windows NT 4.0 only)
--------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0,
you could create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets
with parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using
dynamic disks, introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000, you can take
advantage of similar technologies, and with Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without
repartitioning or reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. For important information
about these choices, see "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets
or Stripe Sets with Parity" in Server2.TXT.


-------------------------------
1.4   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


-------------------------------------
1.5   Reviewing Hardware and Software
-------------------------------------
When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process it carries out
is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along with
information in Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD), to
find out whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or
software before upgrading.

Confirm that your hardware and software is designed for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware and
software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If you have hardware devices that do not use Plug and Play, see
"Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play"
in Server1.TXT.


======================================================================
2.0   STARTING SETUP FOR AN UPGRADE
======================================================================


If you are upgrading to Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition,
you can start Setup from the CD or from a network. For information
about the versions of Windows from which you can upgrade, see
"Operating Systems from Which You Can Upgrade" in Server1.TXT.

For information about providing a mass storage driver or a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file during Setup, see "Providing a Mass
Storage Driver or a HAL File" later in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: To run Setup for an upgrade, you must be a member of the
   Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is
   joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be
   able to perform this procedure. As a security best practice, if
   you start Setup from a computer running Windows 2000, consider
   using Run as.
   Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start
   commands or programs using a different security context. For
   example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and,
   without logging off, run a command as a member of the
   Administrators group. To find more information in Windows 2000
   about Run as, on a server running Windows 2000, click Start, click
   Help, click the Search tab, and then search for "runas."


>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to display a
      dialog box.

   2. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files by either
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows
      Server 2003, Standard Edition, connect to the shared folder or
      drive that contains the Setup files.

   3. Run Setup.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
3.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for a new installation.


----------------------------------------
3.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.


----------------------
3.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you
back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the
current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up
files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the
hard disk of another computer on the network.


-----------------------------
3.3   Uncompressing the Drive
-----------------------------
Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing.
Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file
system compression feature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Windows NT 4.0, you could
create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with
parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using
dynamic disks, introduced with Windows 2000, you can take advantage of
similar technologies, and with Windows Server 2003, Standard
Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without repartitioning or
reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. For important information
about these choices, see "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets
or Stripe Sets with Parity" in Server2.TXT.


-------------------------------
3.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


======================================================================
4.0   STARTING SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the Manage Your Server
program, which you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs.

For important information to help you make the initial choices
offered by Setup, see Server2.TXT and Server3.TXT. For information
about unattended Setup and other options available when you start
Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this text file.


---------------------------------------------------
4.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.


4.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
-------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by
checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the
Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy
disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line
at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts
will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can
gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message
saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete
list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file,
restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.


4.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.


-------------------------------------------------------
4.2   Methods for Starting Setup for a New Installation
-------------------------------------------------------
The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD" and
"Starting a New Installation from a Network," explain how to start
Setup for a new installation. For information about starting Setup for
an upgrade, see "Starting Setup for an Upgrade" earlier in this
text file.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.


4.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
--------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures:

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running
   Microsoft Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk
   caching. Otherwise, the Setup the Setup process (started from
   Winnt.exe) could take a long time. To enable disk caching on a
   computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can use SMARTDrive.
   For information about SMARTDrive, see the documentation for
   Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.


>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running
Windows NT 4.0, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD-ROM drive. This method applies only if you want to perform a
new installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform
an installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have
operating systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive and whether you want to
      perform a new installation (not an upgrade). Continue only if
      both are true.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.


4.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, from a
network, you either share the files directly from the CD or copy them
to a shared folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to
run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, STANDARD EDITION, FROM A
   NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install
      Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, connect to the
      shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
        Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or later,
        Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
5.0   PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================


This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can
view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With
     Windows NT 4.0, before starting unattended Setup, apply Service
     Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation): See "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD for
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in the CD-ROM drive
     and open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive,
     change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     insert the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Standard
     Edition, in the CD-ROM drive, and open the command prompt. Then,
     change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and
     type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the command
     options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition;
     the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition; or the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD
     for the 64-bit version of the product in the CD-ROM drive and
     open the command prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type
     cmd). Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64
     directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup uses
your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see Server2.TXT
and Server3.TXT for important background information about issues such
as partitions, file system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name
resolution. You can modify some settings after running Setup by using
the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration tools.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a
   Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.
   If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
   Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer
   manufacturer, see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this
   text file.


Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or
specify a partition on which you want to install. You can create a
partition from the available unpartitioned space, specify an existing
partition, or delete an existing partition to create more
unpartitioned disk space for the new installation. If you specify any
action that will cause information to be erased, you will be prompted
to confirm your choice.

For more information, see the section on planning partitions for new
installations in Server3.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased. Performing a new installation of
   Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a partition that
   contains another operating system overwrites the existing
   operating system.


Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, to use
multiple languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the
default currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your
needs. After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking
Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify regional and language options by
clicking Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Choosing a Licensing Mode
-------------------------
Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see Server2.TXT. If you are unsure which mode to use, select
"Per Server," because you can change once from "Per Server" mode to
"Per Device or Per User" mode at no cost.


Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in Server3.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."


Setting the Administrator Account Password
------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep
   a strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help
   and Support.


Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.


Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and
Setup, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
in Server3.TXT. For additional information about TCP/IP configuration,
see Help and Support Center as well as the Windows Deployment and
Resource Kits for the Windows Server 2003 family. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on your
     network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP provides
     an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your network, Setup
     will use a limited IP addressing option called Automatic Private
     IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using APIPA, complete the
     network configuration after Setup, because a server using APIPA
     can communicate only with other computers using APIPA on the same
     network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of APIPA,
     see "IP Addresses" in Server3.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS
   AND WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).

   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the address
      of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.


Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
in Server3.TXT.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
7.0   CONFIGURING YOUR SERVER
======================================================================


When Setup is complete, the computer restarts. Setup has now
completed the basic installation. Manage Your Server appears on the
screen the first time you log on as the computer's administrator. You
can use Manage Your Server to install and configure server roles,
including file servers, print servers, Web and media servers, and
networking and communications servers. You can start Manage Your
Server at any time if you are logged on as an administrator. To start
Manage Your Server, click Start, and then either click Manage Your
Server or point to All Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
then click Manage Your Server.

Also at this point, you can view Help and Support Center by clicking
Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have used Windows NT
in the past, one topic you might find useful is "New ways to do
familiar tasks," which is available in the online Help topics or
through use of the Search feature in Help and Support Center.


Choosing Server Components
--------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.


======================================================================
8.0   PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE
      WINDOWS SERVER 2002 FAMILY
======================================================================


After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:

Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.

How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.

Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number
     (toll-free, wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you
     call the number, a customer service representative asks for the
     Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer
     service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.

Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.


---------------------------------------------------------
8.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.

8.0   DECIDING WHETHER A COMPUTER WILL CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE
      OPERATING SYSTEM
======================================================================


On a computer with an appropriate disk configuration (outlined in the
table later in this section), you can install more than one operating
system, and then choose between the operating systems each time you
restart the computer. For example, you could set up a server to run
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, most of the time, but
allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0 in order to support an
older application. (However, to do this you would need to make
specific file system choices and would need Service Pack 5 or later,
as described in "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
Compatibility" and "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.) During restarts, a display would
appear for a specified number of seconds, allowing you to select
between the two operating systems. (You can specify a default
operating system that will run if no selection is made during the
restart process.)

The following table shows the disk configurations on which you can
install more than one operating system.

   IMPORTANT: You must follow the requirements in the following table.
   For example, on a basic disk, you must install each operating
   system, including Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in a
   separate partition. This ensures that each operating system does
   not overwrite crucial files that are needed by another
   operating system.


======================================================================
DISK CONFIGURATION   REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic disk or disks  You can install multiple operating systems,
                     including Windows NT 4.0 and earlier
                     operating systems, on a basic disk. Each
                     operating system must be on a separate
                     partition or logical drive on the disk.

Single dynamic disk  You can install only one operating system.

                     However, if you used Microsoft Windows 2000 or
                     Microsoft Windows XP to change a disk with no
                     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must
                     revert the disk to basic before you can install
                     an operating system on it. For more information,
                     see "Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later
                     in this text file.

Multiple dynamic     Each dynamic disk can contain one installation
disks                of Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in
                     the Windows Server 2003 family. No other
                     operating systems can start from a dynamic disk.

                     However, if you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP
                     to change a disk with no partitions directly
                     to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
                     to basic before you can install an operating
                     system on it. For more information, see "Working
                     with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text
                     file.


--------------------------------------------------
8.1   Reasons to Install Only One Operating System
--------------------------------------------------
Setting up a computer so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems at startup does have an advantage: it allows you to
use applications that run only with a particular operating system.
However, there are definite reasons to install only one
operating system:

   * Each operating system uses valuable disk space.

   * Compatibility issues, especially file system compatibility, can
     be complex. For more information, see "Multiple Operating Systems
     and File System Compatibility" later in this text file.

   * On a dynamic disk (a storage type available with products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family), you can have only one operating
     system per disk. Dynamic disks also will not work with some
     operating systems. For more information, see the table in the
     previous section, "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More
     Than One Operating System."

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in
     which Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, restarts with
     default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For more
     information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2   Requirements for Setting Up a Computer with Multiple Operating
      Systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you decide to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain Microsoft Windows 98 or
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition and
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition must be installed on a
     basic disk on a partition formatted with FAT or FAT32. If either
     Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition is not installed on the
     system partition, which is almost always the first partition on
     the disk, the system partition must also be formatted with FAT or
     FAT32.

   * Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could be overwritten.
   
   * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
     Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
     text file.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition:

   * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility"
     and "Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition," later in this
     text file.

On computers that contain some combination of Windows Server
2003, Standard Edition, with Windows 2000 or Windows XP, or that
contain multiple partitions with products in the Windows Server
2003 family:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition or, for
     dynamic disks, on a different disk, and install the applications
     used with an operating system on the same disk or partition with
     it. If an application is used with two different operating
     systems, install it in two places.

   * Choose any product in the Windows Server 2003 family for
     installation on a specific partition. For example, you could
     install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in one
     location and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
     in another.

   * If Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition,
     are installed, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must
     be installed last. Otherwise important files that are needed for
     starting Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could
     be overwritten.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation. Because a unique security
     identifier (SID) is used for each installation on a domain, the
     computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
     multiple installations on the same computer.

   * If you want to use the Encrypting File System (EFS), you must
     take certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be
     available from each of the installations. For more information,
     see "Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System"
     later in this text file.


--------------------------------------------------------------
8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------------
On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. (For more
information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.)

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it is more
efficient and reliable, and supports important features including
Active Directory and domain-based security. With NTFS, however, you
need to take file system compatibility into account when considering
whether to set up a computer to contain more than one operating
system, because with Windows 2000 and the Windows Server 2003
family, NTFS has new features in addition to those in Windows NT.
Files that use any new features will be completely usable or readable
only when the computer is started with Windows 2000 or a product in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For example, a file that uses the
new encryption feature will not be readable when the computer is
started with Windows NT Server 4.0, which was released before the
encryption feature existed. (For more information about features that
affect file accessibility with products in the Windows
Server 2003 family, see "NTFS" later in this text file.)

   IMPORTANT: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT
   and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and you want to
   have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate version of
   Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released Service Pack.
   Using the latest Service Pack maximizes compatibility between
   Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.
   (Specifically, you must have Service Pack 5 or later.) Even the
   latest Service Pack, however, does not provide access to files
   using the new features in NTFS.

Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows NT is not
recommended. On these computers, a FAT partition containing the
Windows NT 4.0 operating system ensures that when started with
Windows NT 4.0, the computer will have access to needed files. In
addition, if Windows NT is not installed on the system partition,
which is almost always the first partition on the disk, it is
recommended that the system partition also be formatted with FAT.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, on an NTFS partition, when that computer starts with
Windows NT 3.51, the NTFS partition will not be visible. If you set up
a computer this way, and the partition containing Windows NT 3.51 is
not the system partition (which is almost always the first partition
on the disk), the system partition must also be formatted with FAT.


------------------------------------------------------------
8.4   Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
      Server 2003, Standard Edition
------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to set up a computer so that it contains Windows NT 4.0
and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, first review the
following precautions:

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in
     which Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, restarts with
     default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For more
     information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.

   * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains
     both Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows NT
     is not recommended. Follow the guidelines in "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file.
   
   * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
     released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file.
   
   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
     compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS
     file system compression feature.

   * Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could be overwritten.
   
   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation.


---------------------------------------------------------------
8.5   Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you set up a server so that it contains some combination of
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, with Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, or contains multiple partitions with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use the Encrypting
File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain steps. These
steps make encrypted files readable between the
different installations.

   * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
     same domain and that the user of these installations has a
     roaming profile.

   * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
     certificate and associated private key from one installation and
     import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing
and exporting certificates, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   CHOOSING A FILE SYSTEM FOR THE INSTALLATION PARTITION
======================================================================


You can choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations.

   Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and
   domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

The following table lists a number of installation scenarios (the
last two scenarios are fairly uncommon) and provides file system
guidelines for each one:

The sections that follow provide information about reformatting or
converting a FAT or FAT32 partition to use NTFS, as well as additional
background information about NTFS, FAT, and FAT32.


--------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS
--------------------------------------------------------
If you have a FAT or FAT32 partition on which you want to install a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use
NTFS instead, you have two choices:

   * You can convert the FAT or FAT32 partition to NTFS. This leaves
     files intact, although the partition may have somewhat more
     fragmentation and slower performance than a partition formatted
     with NTFS. However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS,
     regardless of whether the partition was formatted with NTFS
     or converted.

     If you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on a FAT or FAT32 partition, you are offered the option to
     convert the partition to NTFS. You can also convert a FAT or
     FAT32 partition after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
     information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click
     Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command
     window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

   * You can reformat the partition with NTFS. This erases all files
     on the partition, but results in less fragmentation and better
     performance than with a converted partition.

If you format a partition during Setup, the file systems choices are
listed as NTFS and FAT. The following table provides information about
the relationship between partition size and file system choices during
Setup.

                                continues to support
                                previously-formatted FAT32 partitions
                                of this size.


If you format a partition during Setup, you can choose between a quick
format and a full format:

Quick format
Quick format creates the file system structure on the disk without
verifying the integrity of every sector. Choose this method for any
disk that has no bad sectors and no history of file-corruption
problems that might be related to bad sectors.

Full format
A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors so that they are not
used for storing data. Choose this method for any disk that has bad
sectors or has a history of file-corruption problems that might be
related to bad sectors.


------------------------------------
9.2   NTFS Compared to FAT and FAT32
------------------------------------
NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family
include a new version of NTFS, with support for a variety of features
including Active Directory, which is needed for domains, user
accounts, and other important security features. For more details
about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text file.

FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except that FAT32 is
designed for larger disks than FAT. The file system that works most
easily with large disks is NTFS.

The following table describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems.

   Note: File system choices have no effect on access to files across
   the network. For example, using NTFS on all partitions on a server
   does not affect clients connecting across a network to shared
   folders or shared files on that server, even if those clients run
   an earlier operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows NT.

----------
9.3   NTFS
----------
This section provides background information about the features
available with NTFS. Some of these features include:

   * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or
     volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as
     volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS does
     not degrade as it does with FAT.

   * Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active
     Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control
     network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune
     security options while keeping administration simple. Domain
     controllers and Active Directory require NTFS.

   * Compression features, including the ability to compress or
     uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than
     just folders.

   * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
     making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This
     feature is not included with Windows Server 2003, Web
     Edition, or with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.)

   * Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to restore
     information quickly in the event of power failure or other system
     problems.

   * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
     in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
     NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that are
     written to.

   * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
     of disk space used by individual users.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in the
Windows Server 2003 family.

For information about converting or reformatting a FAT or FAT32
partition, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS"
earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
10.0   PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both
of the following conditions are true:

   * You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade.

   * The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a
     dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before
     Windows 2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are disks
     that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using Windows
     2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk, you cannot
     change the volume or partition sizes on the disk during Setup,
     and therefore no planning is needed regarding partition sizes.
     Instead, review the guidelines in "Working with Dynamic Disks and
     Setup" later in this text file.

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS.
Different partitions often have different drive letters (for example,
C: and D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or
three primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended
partition can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary
partition cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
compressed drive unless the partition was compressed with the NTFS
file system compression feature. (Uncompress a DriveSpace or
DoubleSpace drive before running Setup on it.)

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, require approximately 1.25
GB to 2 GB, as described in "System Requirements" in Server1.TXT. It
is recommended that you allow considerably more disk space than the
minimum amount. It is not unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB on the
partition, or more for large installations. This allows space for a
variety of items, including optional components, user accounts, Active
Directory information, logs, future service packs, the paging file
used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. After installation
is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new and existing
disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions from
unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting
existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a
basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic. (If
you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that contains more than
one operating system, be sure to read "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
file.)

   IMPORTANT: If you are setting up a computer so that it contains
   multiple operating systems, you must install
   Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on its own partition
   or logical drive. This ensures that Windows Server 2003,
   Standard Edition, will not overwrite crucial files that are needed
   by the other operating system. For more information, see "Deciding
   Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System"
   earlier in this text file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a
separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is
necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for
the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.

If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation
Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned
disk space so that you can create it (at least 4 GB of space is
recommended). As an alternative, you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk. (However, if you want to have a dynamic disk
on a computer that contains more than one operating system, see
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" earlier in this text file.)

For more information about Remote Installation Services and about
disk and partition choices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

---------------------------------------
10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
---------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
     space, you can create the partition for your
     Windows Server 2003 family product by using the
     unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on that partition, with or without reformatting the partition
     first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on the partition.
     If you do not reformat the partition, but you do install a
     Windows Server 2003 family product where there is already an
     operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
     you must reinstall any applications you want to use with the
     Windows Server 2003 family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Deleting an
     existing partition also erases any data on that partition.


-------------------------------------------
10.3   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
-------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform
a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.

        CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
        disk to basic, so back it up first.

You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you can
use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server 2003
family. To use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, follow the instructions in
Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find
the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then
delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted
to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only
unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic
disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and
     the computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see topics
     about dynamic disks and the partition table in Help and Support
     Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup,
     click Start, and then click Help and Support.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
10.4   Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets
       with Parity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you
must prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with
Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets, or Stripe Sets with Parity"
in Server2.TXT.


======================================================================
11.0   NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================


TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections
provide more information.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


-------------------
11.1   IP Addresses
-------------------
As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP
addressing options. There are two basic approaches for providing an IP
address for a server you are installing:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in Server4.TXT.

Static IP addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.


---------------------------------
11.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
---------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical
IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP
network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System (DNS) and
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller
(or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server,
which makes it a domain controller), unless the software
for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, detects that a DNS
server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by
choosing the DNS server role in Manage Your Server or by using
Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution.

WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any earlier
Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You might
also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. You
can install WINS after Setup by choosing the WINS server role in
Manage Your Server or by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is
part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server.


======================================================================
12.0   DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================


A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

---------------------------------------------------------
12.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
---------------------------------------------------------
With Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition;
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, servers in a domain can have one of
two roles: domain controllers, which contain matching copies of the
user accounts and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and
member servers, which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of
the Active Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not
a domain, is called a stand-alone server.) It is possible to change
the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to member
server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete. However,
it is recommended that you plan your domain before running Setup and
change server roles (and server names) only when necessary.

Multiple domain controllers provide better support for users,
compared to a single domain controller. With multiple domain
controllers, you have multiple copies of user account data and other
Active Directory data; however, it is still important to perform
regular backups, including Automated System Recovery backups, and
familiarize yourself with the methods for restoring a domain
controller. In addition, multiple domain controllers work together to
support domain controller functions, such as carrying out logon
validations. For more information about domain controllers and other
Active Directory topics, see Help and Support Center (after completing
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

======================================================================
1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, read this
section to ensure that your equipment meets the minimum requirements
and that you have the information you will need during Setup.

-------------------------
1.1 Hardware Requirements
-------------------------
Before you install Windows XP, make sure your computer meets the
following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 733 megahertz (MHz) Intel Itanium architecture-based
     microprocessor

   * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM (minimum)

   * 4 GB of free hard disk space (minimum) for Setup

   * VGA monitor or better

   * Keyboard

   * Mouse or compatible pointing device

   * CD-ROM drive

For network installation:

   * Windows XP-compatible network adapter card and related cable

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

------------------------------------------------
1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
------------------------------------------------
Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and reports
any potential conflicts. To help ensure a successful installation,
however, you should determine whether your computer hardware is
compatible with Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 before you
start Setup. This is particularly important if you are using a
high-end video card for rendering three-dimensional graphics, or if
you are using computer peripherals other than the minimum hardware 
requirements mentioned in the previous section.

You can view compatibility information at the Microsoft
Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog

   IMPORTANT: Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 supports only
   those devices listed in the Windows Catalog. If your hardware is
   not on this list, contact the hardware manufacturer and ask for 
   a Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 driver for the component. 

During Setup, you can use Dynamic Update to ensure that you are 
getting the most up-to-date Setup files for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition
Version 2003.

---------------------------------
1.3 Obtaining Network Information
---------------------------------
The first step is to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you do not know which option to choose or if your
computer will not be connected to a network, select the workgroup
option. (You can join a domain after you install Windows XP.)

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request the
following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer

   * Name of the workgroup or domain

   * TCP/IP address (if your network does not have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during Setup, you must have the correct
hardware installed on your computer and it must be connected by 
a network cable. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium Architecture-based
    Computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Itanium architecture-based computers have specific partitioning
requirements.
Two partitions are created automatically when you install Windows XP
64-Bit Edition Version 2003 for the first time on your computer.

   *  The first partition is a FAT partition of about 100 megabytes
      (MB). Called the EFI system Partition, this partition is used
      to store programs and information files that the Extensible
      Firmware Interface (EFI) uses to automatically start
      Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003.

   *  The Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition may be 32 MB or 128 MB, 
      depending on the size of the hard disk. The MSR partition
      allows the operating system to perform operations that require
      dedicated disk space, such as changing a disk from basic to
      dynamic. (Note, on hard disks larger than 16 GB, the MSR will
      be 128 MB.)

The EFI system partition is the first partition on your hard disk 
and the MSR partition is the second partition. If you are using 
multiple hard disks, the MSR partition is the first partition  on your
second hard disk and all subsequent hard disks. Only one  EFI system
partition is necessary for a computer, and it must be on your boot drive.

For information about EFI utilities, see the documentation supplied
by your computer vendor.

   IMPORTANT: The recommended minimum partition size for 
   installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is 4 GB.

======================================================================
2.0 Installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
======================================================================

Setup for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is divided into two
phases. The first phase is text-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup
copies files to the computer, checks your hardware, and configures
your installation. You can also choose to create multiple partitions
during this phase. Your computer will restart at the end of this
phase.

The second phase is GUI-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup gathers 
information such as regional options, user name and password, and 
network information. Your computer will restart when Setup is 
complete. 

Setup creates the EFI system partition and the MSR partition 
automatically. It is recommended that you create a single data 
partition of no less than 4 GB for installing the operating system. 

>>>To install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003:

1. Ensure that the hardware for your Itanium architecture-based
   computer is set up properly and that everything is attached as it
   should be.

2. Turn on your computer.

3. Insert the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 CD into the
   CD-ROM drive.

4. When prompted in the EFI Boot Manager, boot to the CD-ROM drive.

   When you see "Press any key to boot from CD-ROM...", press a key
   and text-mode Setup begins.

   If the CD does not start automatically, boot to the EFI shell, 
   select the CD-ROM drive, type:

   setupldr

   and then press ENTER.

      Note: Setup can create the EFI system partition and the MSR 
      partition automatically. If you want, you can choose to create 
      the EFI system partition yourself, but it is recommended that 
      you let Setup create this partition.

5. When prompted to install Windows, determine the size of 
   your data partition. The recommended minimum size for 
   installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is 4 GB. 

6. Follow the directions that appear. Once GUI-mode Setup is 
   complete, the computer restarts automatically. 

--------------------------------------------
2.1 Collecting User and Computer Information
--------------------------------------------
Setup helps you gather information about you and your computer.
Although much of this installation process is automatic, you
might need to provide information or select settings on the
following pages, depending on the configuration of your computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to
     continue the setup process, select the option labeled "I
     accept this agreement."

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Windows XP installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations.
     You can set up Windows XP to use multiple languages and
     regional options.

   * Regional and Language Options. Change the system and user
     locale settings for different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person
     to whom this copy of Windows XP is licensed and, optionally,
     the organization.

   * Computer Name and Administrative Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain names
     on your network. Setup suggests a computer name, but you can
     change the name.

     Setup automatically creates an Administrator account during 
     installation. When you use this account, you have full rights
     over the computer's settings and can create user accounts on
     the computer. Logging on as an Administrator after you install 
     Windows XP gives you administrative rights that you need in 
     order to log on and manage your computer. Specify a password
     for the Administrator account. For security reasons, you should 
     always assign a password to the Administrator account. Take care
     to remember and protect your password.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you
     want Windows XP to automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you are an advanced user, select
     Typical settings for your network configuration. To manually 
     configure network clients, services, and protocols, select 
     Custom settings.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must
     join either a workgroup or a domain. For details on both of these
     options, see "Providing Networking Information" in section 2.2
     of this document.
     
   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who will
     be using your computer. Each person with an account on the
     computer can be assigned different levels of access.

------------------------------------
2.2 Providing Networking Information
------------------------------------
During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you will not be working on a network, select the option
to join a workgroup.

2.2.1 Joining a Workgroup
-------------------------
A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a peer-to-peer network). Any user can join a workgroup by
typing the workgroup name--you don't need special permissions
to join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup
name, or you can use the workgroup name that Setup suggests.

2.2.2 Joining a Domain
----------------------
A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, while the
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network administrator.
Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself, joining a domain
requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must already have an
existing computer account in the domain you want to join, or have the
rights to create one. You are prompted to type a new computer account
name. Before you run Setup, ask your network administrator to create a
computer account. Or, if you have the appropriate rights, you can create
the account during the setup process and join the domain. To join a
domain, you need to provide your user name and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Windows XP.

---------------------------
2.3 Creating a User Account
---------------------------
Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you are a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator 
rights.

>>>To create a user account: 

1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click User Accounts. 

3. If your computer is on a domain, click Add and then follow the 
   instructions that appear.

   If your computer is not on a domain, under Pick a task, click 
   Create a new account, and then follow the instructions that 
   appear on your screen.

======================================================================
3.0 Advanced Setup Options 
======================================================================

This section provides more detailed information and can help you make 
decisions about how you install Windows XP.

----------------
3.1 File Systems
----------------
Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, you should
decide which file system you will use. A file system is the method by
which information is stored on a hard disk.

Windows XP supports the NTFS file system or one of the file allocation
table file systems (FAT or FAT32). To set up a dual-boot configuration,
you should select one file system for all your partitions: FAT32 or NTFS.

   Note: The 102 MB EFI system partition will automatically use the
   FAT file system. You should not change this, because using 
   another file system will cause problems.

3.1.1 NTFS
----------
The NTFS file system is the recommended file system for use with
Windows XP. It has all of the basic capabilities of FAT, and it
provides the following advantages over the FAT and FAT32 file
systems:

   * Better file security
   * Better disk compression
   * Support for large hard disks, up to 2 terabytes (TB). (The
     maximum disk size for NTFS is much greater than for disks
     formatted as FAT, and as disk size increases, performance 
     with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with FAT.)

3.1.2 FAT and FAT32
-------------------
FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system that can be used
on drives ranging from 512 MB to 32 GB. FAT and FAT32 offer compatibility
with operating systems other than Windows XP. 

-------------------
3.2 Disk Partitions
-------------------
Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your hard disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. You can create a partition to
provide a place to back up data or to dual-boot with another operating
system. When you create partitions on a disk, you divide the disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by a file system, such
as FAT32 or NTFS.

During text-mode Setup, you can create and delete partitions. Follow 
these guidelines for partitioning:

   *   A minimum of 4 GB is recommended for installing Windows XP 
       64-Bit Edition Version 2003. A partition of this size provides
       flexibility for adding future updates, operating system tools,
       or other files.

   *   During Setup, you should create and size only the partition on 
       which you want to install Windows XP. After Windows XP is 
       installed, you can use Disk Management to further partition the
       unallocated space.

For more information about Disk Management, open Help and Support 
Center from the Start menu in Windows.

----------------------------------
3.3 Modifying the EFI Boot Manager
----------------------------------
The EFI Boot Manager enables you to boot to the shell, to Windows XP 
or another operating system, or to the CD-ROM drive. Your computer 
will attempt to boot to each of the listed options, starting with the 
first option, until it finds a valid bootable entry. You can change 
the order of items on the boot menu. For example, if you want to boot 
to the shell first, you can make Shell the first item on your boot 
menu. If you install more than one operating system, you can choose 
which is listed first.

You can also make other changes to the Boot Manager menu, such as renaming
a boot option or exporting the boot options to a floppy disk.

>>>To make changes to your boot options:

1.  Boot to the EFI shell.

2.  Switch to the hard disk. Your hard disk is normally located at 
    fs0 or fs1. For example, type:

    fs0: 

    and then press ENTER.

3.  Change to the Msutil folder. Type:

    cd msutil

    and then press ENTER.
    If there is no Msutil folder, you are not in the correct place.
       
    Try a different fs option.

4.  Use the nvrboot.efi program to modify EFI Boot Manager options.
    To start it, type:

    nvrboot

    and then press ENTER.

5.  Make the changes to your boot options. For example, to rename 
    a boot option, type M to Modify, and then follow the directions
    that appear on your screen. To move a boot option to the top
    of the boot option menu, use the Push command. To save a copy
    of your boot options to a floppy disk, use the Export command.

5.1   Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a
      Windows NT 4.0 Domain
-----------------------------------------------------
There are three stages to the process of upgrading servers in a
domain where all the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0:

Basic preparations
------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out
before upgrading servers to a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family, such as confirming hardware compatibility and
reviewing the partitioning of the disks on the servers. For more
information, see "Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers
in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.


Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
involves understanding the server roles available, as well as
deciding when to upgrade domain controllers in relation to
member servers:

   * The server roles available for servers running Windows NT are
     slightly different than for servers running Windows Server 2003.
     Also, in contrast with servers running Windows NT, you can change
     the role of a server running Windows Server 2003 without
     reinstalling the operating system. For more information, see 
     "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from 
     Windows NT" later in this text file.

   * If the first server running Windows NT 4.0 you upgrade is a
     member server, many features become available immediately. For
     information about reasons for upgrading a particular member
     server early in the process, see "Features Available with the
     Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this
     text file.

   * When you upgrade the primary domain controller, many Active
     Directory features become available (in addition to all the
     other features in the Windows Server 2003 family). For
     information about how these features can simplify
     administration, see "Features Available with the First Domain
     Controller Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text
     file.

     However, the upgrade to Active Directory also involves some
     advance planning. For information about the planning necessary
     before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning DNS for
     the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0" later
     in this text file.

        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers
        running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary
        domain controller first.


Performing backups and carrying out the upgrade process
-------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning the
upgrades, such as ensuring that you have applied Service Pack 5 or
later, and performing backups:

   * For information about the preparations to make just before
     beginning the upgrade, see "Applying the Service Pack,
     Performing Backups, and Other Preparations" later in this text
     file.

   * For information about choices to make during the upgrade of the
     primary domain controller, see "Running the Active Directory
     Installation Wizard After Upgrading the Primary Domain
     Controller" later in this text file.

   * For information about Help and Support Center topics about
     Active Directory, see "Learning About Active Directory After
     the First Server is Upgraded" later in this text file. You can
     also view the topics about Active Directory at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

   * For guidelines regarding further upgrades, see "Completing
     Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0" later in this text file.
     

--------------------------------------------------------
5.2   Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a
      Windows NT Domain
--------------------------------------------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out to
lay the groundwork for upgrading servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how these
preparations fit into the overall process of the upgrade, see "Stages
in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: If you have servers or client computers that
   run Windows NT 3.51, it is recommended that you install or upgrade
   to a newer operating system on all these computers, or retire them
   from operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade
   domain controllers running Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon
   validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running
   Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of
   version differences between computers, simplifying management and
   troubleshooting.

Compatibility check
-------------------
Check to see whether the applications and hardware on your systems
are compatible with products in the Windows Server 2003 family,
and then update or replace them as necessary. For important details
about how to do this, see "Hardware Compatibility" and "Important
Files to Review" in EntSrv1.TXT.

Review partition sizes, especially on domain controllers
--------------------------------------------------------
Review the partitions on the servers to make sure there is plenty of
free space available for a Windows Server 2003 operating system to
run. It is especially important to allow plenty of free space on
domain controllers, because the existing user accounts database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten when Active Directory
functionality is added. For information about the disk requirements
for the operating system, see "System Requirements" in EntSrv1.TXT.

Review file systems on server partitions
----------------------------------------
You must have at least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It
is recommended that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers
in the domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security
features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can
be protected only by the permissions set on the shared folder, not on
individual files, and there is no software protection against local
access to the partition. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System for the Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting
a Partition to Use NTFS" in EntSrv3.TXT.

Service pack
------------
Obtain Service Pack 5 or later, because it is necessary for
the upgrade.

Mirror sets or other disk sets
------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, you
must prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with
Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" later in
this text file.


5.2.1  Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets
       or Stripe Sets with Parity
--------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Windows NT 4.0, you could
create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with
parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using the
dynamic disk technology introduced with Windows 2000, you can use
similar technologies, with the added flexibility of being able to
extend disk volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. Any volume sets, mirror
sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity that you created with
Windows NT 4.0 are not supported in Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, although they were supported to a limited extent
in Windows 2000.

If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, you
must choose one of the following methods.

For a mirror set, break the mirror
----------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a mirror set
and you want to run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
Edition, on that computer, first back up the data (as a safeguard --
the data will not be erased) and then break the mirror. Ensure that
you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required before running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. Then
run Setup.

For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up the
data and delete the set
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a volume
set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup
for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer,
first back up the data. Next, delete the set (which will delete the
data). Ensure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required
before running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
Then run Setup.

After running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up data as necessary,
and make use of the volume options shown in the table later in this
section. For more information about dynamic disks, see Help and
Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

If necessary, use the Ftonline support tool
-------------------------------------------
The preceding methods are the recommended methods for preparing to
run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a
computer that contains a volume set, mirror set, stripe set, or stripe
set with parity created with Windows NT 4.0. However, if you do not
use these methods and you must access one of these sets after running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, you can use
the Ftonline tool. The Ftonline tool is part of the Windows
Server 2003 family Support Tools. For more information, see topics on
Support Tools and on Ftonline in Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

Types of Multidisk Volumes on Dynamic Disks
-------------------------------------------
The disk sets described in the previous section have different names
in the Windows Server 2003 family than they had in Windows NT 4.0:


======================================================================
WINDOWS NT 4.0 NAME            WINDOWS SERVER 2003 FAMILY NAME
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume set                     Spanned volume on a dynamic disk
Mirror set                     Mirrored volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set                     Striped volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set with parity         RAID-5 volume on a dynamic disk


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.3   Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
      Windows NT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a list of basic guidelines to use when planning
server roles and the order of server upgrades in a domain where all
the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how
this planning fits into the overall process of the upgrade, see
"Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0
Domain" earlier in this text file.

Use the following guidelines when planning server roles and the order
of server upgrades from Windows NT:

   * Familiarize yourself with the slight differences between the
     naming of server roles for servers running Windows NT as compared
     to servers running Windows Server 2003:

     * In Windows NT, there are two kinds of domain controllers, the
       primary domain controller, which is limited to one per domain
       and contains a read-write database, and the backup domain
       controller, which is not limited in number and contains a
       read-only database.

     * For domain controllers running Windows Server 2003, there is
       only one kind of domain controller, without a "primary" or 
       "backup" designation. All domain controllers contain matching 
       copies of the user accounts and other Active Directory data in 
       a given domain, and provide read-write access to that data.

     * In addition to domain controllers, the possible roles for
       either operating system include member server, which belongs
       to a domain but does not contain a copy of the Active Directory
       data, and stand-alone server, which belongs to a workgroup
       instead of a domain.

   * Note that in contrast with Windows NT, you can change the role of
     a server without rerunning Setup. However, as a general practice,
     it is best to plan the roles ahead of time and change them only
     as necessary.

   * As was true with Windows NT, a domain must have at least one
     domain controller, but it is recommended that a domain have
     multiple domain controllers for resilience in the handling of
     logon requests and directory updates.

   * If the features you need most are not Active Directory features,
     you can focus on upgrading member servers first. For information
     about reasons for upgrading a particular member server early in
     the process, see "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any
     Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * If the features you need most are Active Directory features,
     focus on upgrading domain controllers first, and carry out the
     advance planning that is necessary for this part of the upgrade.

        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain
        controllers running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the
        primary domain controller first.

For information about the features that come with Active Directory,
see "Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade in
a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file. For information about
the planning necessary before upgrading to Active Directory, see
"Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running
Windows NT 4.0" later in this text file.

   * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
     access server that is a member server, it is recommended that you
     upgrade it before the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a
     server is dependent on domain controllers for user information,
     and therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers
     are upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security
     permissions in Active Directory so that the remote access server
     running Windows NT can read user attributes from the domain
     controllers running products in the Windows Server 2003
     family. For more information, see the Windows Server 2003
     Deployment Kit.


5.3.1  Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a
       Windows NT Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, you
might want to focus on upgrading the member servers in your Windows NT
4.0 domain. For information about reasons to upgrade the domain
controllers, see "Features Available with the First Domain Controller
Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * Management tools:

     Microsoft Management Console
     Plug and Play
     Device Manager
     Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
     Support for universal serial bus
     Enhanced Backup utility

   * File system support: The version of NTFS in the Windows
     Server 2003 family includes support for disk quotas, the ability
     to defragment directory structures, and compressed network I/O.

   * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and
     Windows Script Host.

   * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
     choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
     enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
     Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
     over an intranet or the Internet.

   * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
     support as compared to Windows NT.

   * Security: Encrypting File System.


5.3.2  Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade
       in a Windows NT Domain
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, all of
which are features of Active Directory, focus on upgrading the primary
domain controller, as opposed to member servers. (The first domain
controller that you upgrade must be the primary domain controller. It
is recommended that you also upgrade backup domain controllers.) For
information about the DNS planning necessary before beginning the
upgrade of domain controllers running Windows NT, see "Planning DNS
for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0," later
in this text file.

For information about reasons to upgrade member servers, see
"Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT
Domain" earlier in this text file.

After running Setup, you can also display topics about Active
Directory and other feature areas in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support).

   Note: When a domain controller is upgraded, it has all
   the features of the Windows Server 2003 family, which means
   it has all the features in the following list, plus the features
   in "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a
   Windows NT Domain" earlier in this text file.

When you upgrade a domain controller to run a Windows Server 2003
operating system instead of Windows NT, many Active Directory features
become available in the domain:

   * Simplified management of network-resource information and
     user information.

   * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
     a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active Directory.

   * Security and authentication features, including support for
     Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer 3.0, and Transport Layer
     Security using X.509v3 certificates.

   * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
     simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
     devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
     they want. You can take advantage of synchronization support
     through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
     Protocol (LDAP), and work with directory consolidation
     requirements specific to your applications.

   * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make it
     easier to configure and manage applications and other
     directory-enabled network components.

   * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
     scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
     technology and advanced replication techniques to
     speed performance.

   * Use of Internet standards, including access through Lightweight
     Directory Access Protocol and a namespace based on the Domain
     Name System (DNS).

   * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful
     development environment.

   * Additional Active Directory features.


5.3.3  Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running
       Windows NT 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system used for
locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. This
section describes the planning for DNS that is recommended before you
upgrade to Active Directory, that is, before you upgrade the primary
domain controller in a Windows NT domain to become a domain controller
running Windows Server 2003.

DNS is the name resolution service used by Active Directory. Products
in the Windows Server 2003 family can support both the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) common in Windows NT networks, and DNS.
You must deploy DNS to support Active Directory. You can choose to
migrate from WINS to DNS or configure your new DNS infrastructure to
support your current WINS infrastructure.

For the upgrading of a network with one to five servers and 100 or
fewer clients (which is the size of network discussed in this text
file series), only a simple DNS plan is needed, because there will be
no parent or child domains. (For information about upgrading networks
with more than five servers, see the Windows Server 2003
Deployment Kit.) DNS names consist of name labels separated by
periods. A simple DNS domain name for a Windows Server 2003
family domain could take the form domainname.ext where ext is an
established "top-level domain" type such as com or org. With a domain
name of that form, the form of a computer name in the domain would be:

computername.domainname.ext

When you upgrade the primary domain controller in a Windows NT 4.0
domain (the primary domain controller must be upgraded first, before
backup domain controllers), you will be offered several different
options for the handling of DNS. If there is no DNS server available
to work with Active Directory, you will be offered, by default, the
option of installing DNS on the domain controller you are upgrading
(formerly the primary domain controller). In a network with one to
five servers, the simplest approach is to accept this default. Then,
after completing the upgrade of the server on which DNS was installed,
take note of its static IP address, and configure other computers to
send any DNS requests to that IP address. For additional basic
information about DNS and how to configure it during Setup, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in EntSrv3.TXT. For more detailed information
about DNS, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits as well as
Help and Support Center. One way to view these sources of information
is to work from any computer that has Internet access (regardless of
the operating system running on that computer). You can view these
sources of information at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Another way to view information about DNS is to go to a computer
running any product in the Windows Server 2003 family, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.


------------------------------------------------------------
5.4   Performing Backups and Carrying out Upgrades of Domain
      Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning an upgrade
from Windows NT 4.0, such as ensuring that you have applied Service
Pack 5 or later, and performing backups. During the upgrade, there are
a few choices to make for the upgrade of a network of two to five
servers (a network within the size of those discussed in this text
file series). The following sections describe these final preparations
and provide guidelines for making choices.

Before beginning this stage of the upgrade process, be sure to review
"Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows NT Domain"
and "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
Windows NT" earlier in this text file.


5.4.1  Applying the Service Pack, Performing Backups, and Other
       Preparations
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before beginning an upgrade of servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0, apply an appropriate Service
Pack, perform backups, and consider whether to remove a backup domain
controller temporarily from the network:

   * Be sure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later to the
     servers. You must apply Service Pack 5 or later before you can
     begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0.

   * As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your
     servers, it is recommended that you back up each server before
     upgrading it. Also be sure to review "Preparing Your System for
     an Upgrade" in EntSrv4.TXT.

   * If you are preparing to upgrade the primary domain controller, to
     protect your existing network integrity, consider removing a
     backup domain controller temporarily from the network. To do
     this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a backup domain
     controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the user
     accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
     cable. After the upgrade of your primary domain controller to
     become a domain controller running Windows Server 2003 (you must 
     upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
     system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
     controller if necessary. However, in the course of an uneventful 
     upgrade, you would not and could not promote the Windows NT backup
     domain controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would
     continue the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the
     disconnected server and upgrading it.


5.4.2  Running the Active Directory Installation Wizard After
       Upgrading the Primary Domain Controller
-------------------------------------------------------------
To upgrade the primary domain controller to become a domain
controller running Windows Server 2003, you must first run Setup to
upgrade the operating system. After the operating system is installed,
you can run the Active Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on
the screen the first time you log on). This section provides guidelines
for making choices in the Active Directory Installation Wizard when
upgrading the primary domain controller.

For information about preparations necessary before beginning the
upgrade, see "Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a
Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file. For information
about starting Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain
   controllers running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary
   domain controller first.

The following table shows the choices that are recommended when
running the Active Directory Installation Wizard on the server that
was formerly the primary domain controller. These recommendations are
for a network of two to five servers (a network within the size of
those discussed in this text file series):


======================================================================
CHOICES ON THE SERVER          RECOMMENDED ACTION FOR A NETWORK
THAT WAS FORMERLY THE          OF TWO TO FIVE SERVERS
PRIMARY DOMAIN CONTROLLER      
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain in a new forest         Choose Domain in a new forest.
or                             
Child domain in an             
existing domain tree           
or                             
Domain tree in an              
existing forest                

Forest functional level of     Choose Windows Server 2003
                               interim.

(This choice appears only      you can have domain controllers
if Domain in a new forest      running Windows NT 4.0 or 
was previously selected.)      Windows Server 2003, but no domain 
                               controllers running Windows 2000. 
                               For more information,
                               see Help and Support Center.


During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three
important items: the database containing user accounts and other
Active Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (Sysvol)
folder. The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition
(FAT, FAT32, or NTFS); the database can expand by as much as a factor
of ten from the size it had with Windows NT, so allow plenty of room
for it. (Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The
system volume folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information
about NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System for the
Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to
Use NTFS" in EntSrv3.TXT.)


5.4.3  Learning About Active Directory After the First Server
       is Upgraded
-------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as the first server is upgraded, you can open Help and
Support Center and read information about how to use Active Directory.
To open Help and Support Center, click Start, and then click Help and
Support. The following list provides suggestions about information
to review:

   * Additional information about upgrading from a Windows NT
     4.0 domain.

   * "New ways to do familiar tasks," that is, a table that compares
     the way you completed domain tasks with Windows NT with the way
     you complete those tasks with products in the Windows
     Server 2003 family.

   * Domains and forests.

   * Functional levels (domain functional level and forest functional
     level). After upgrading the last domain controller in a
     Windows NT domain to become a domain controller running
     Windows Server 2003, you have the option of changing functional
     levels, as described in the Active Directory topics.

5.4.4  Completing Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------
After you upgrade your primary domain controller and ensure that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, you can begin the upgrade of any
backup domain controllers. (You can upgrade member servers at any
time.)

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Before beginning the upgrade of each
backup domain controller, make sure that at least one domain
controller running Windows Server 2003 is available on the network,
because the user accounts and other Active Directory data will be 
copied from the domain controllers that have already been upgraded. 
Start and test each server on the network to ensure that it is
functioning to your satisfaction before upgrading another backup 
domain controller.

An upgraded domain controller will appear as a Windows NT 4.0 primary
domain controller to servers and client computers running
Windows NT 4.0. However, it is recommended that you complete the
upgrade of all servers in the domain relatively quickly (rather than
allowing a long delay). This reduces the number of version differences
between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting, and
also strengthens security.

If you have a remote access server that is a member server, it is
recommended that you upgrade it before the last domain controller is
upgraded. For more information, see "Planning Server Roles and the
Order of Server Upgrades from Windows NT" earlier in this text file.

6.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================


This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

   Note: On an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can install
   Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of Windows
   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or the 64-bit version of
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. In the sections that
   follow, information about operating systems that you cannot install
   does not apply. For example, information about Windows 2000 or
   Windows NT 4.0 does not apply to an Itanium architecture-based
   computer.


What licensing mode to use
--------------------------
With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you can choose
between two licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User

   * Per Server

Per Device or Per User mode requires a separate Client Access License
(CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server running a product
in the Windows Server 2003 family. Per Server mode requires a
separate CAL for each concurrent connection to a server. For more
information about licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in
this text file.


Whether you want to be able to choose between different operating
systems each time you start the computer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" in EntSrv3.TXT.


What file system to use on the installation partition
-----------------------------------------------------
You can potentially choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that
supports Active Directory, which includes many important features
such as domains and domain-based security. However, it might be
necessary to have a FAT or FAT32 partition on a basic disk in an
x86-based computer, if you must set up the computer so that it
sometimes runs Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and
sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or an earlier operating system. For
more information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" in EntSrv3.TXT.


What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing
partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system.
Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters
(for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" in EntSrv3.TXT.


How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
in EntSrv3.TXT.


Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
in EntSrv3.TXT.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================


Products in the Windows Server 2003 family support two licensing
modes:

   * Per Device or Per User

   * Per Server

If you choose the "Per Device or Per User" mode, each device or user
that accesses a server running a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL).
With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of
servers running products in the Windows Server 2003 family. This
is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more
than one server running products in the Windows Server 2003
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words,
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with
five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at
any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five
clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not
need any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access
servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network
clients for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server, because you
can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at
no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can
display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support). If you use Terminal Server,
be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.

1.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR AN UPGRADE
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for an upgrade.

If you are upgrading Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on
server cluster nodes, be sure to read EntSrv5.TXT and EntSrv6.TXT.


----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Help for the operating system that you
are running.


----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before upgrading, it is recommended that you back up your current
files, including anything containing configuration information, for
example, the System State and the system and boot partitions. You can
back up files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or
the hard disk of another computer on the network.


--------------------------------------------------------------
1.3   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for an Upgrade
      (Windows NT 4.0 only)
--------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0,
you could create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets
with parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using
dynamic disks, introduced with Windows 2000, you can take advantage of
similar technologies, and with Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without repartitioning or
reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. For important
information about these choices, see "Working with Volume, Mirror,
or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" in EntSrv2.TXT.


-------------------------------
1.4   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


-------------------------------------
1.5   Reviewing Hardware and Software
-------------------------------------
When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process it carries out
is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along with
information in Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD), to
find out whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or
software before upgrading.

Confirm that your hardware and software is designed for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware and
software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If you have hardware devices that do not use Plug and Play, see
"Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play"
in EntSrv1.TXT.


======================================================================
2.0   STARTING SETUP FOR AN UPGRADE
======================================================================


If you are upgrading to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
you can start Setup from the CD or from a network. For information
about the versions of Windows from which you can upgrade, see
"Operating Systems from Which You Can Upgrade" in EntSrv1.TXT.

For information about providing a mass storage driver or a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file during Setup, see "Providing a Mass
Storage Driver or a HAL File" later in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: To run Setup for an upgrade, you must be a member of the
   Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is
   joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be
   able to perform this procedure. As a security best practice, if you
   start Setup from a computer running Windows 2000, consider using
   Run as.

Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands
or programs using a different security context. For example, you can
log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running Windows
2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then search
for "runas."

>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to display a
      dialog box.

   2. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files by either
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows
      Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, connect to the shared folder
      or drive that contains the Setup files.

   3. Run Setup.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
3.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for a new installation.

If you are installing Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
on server cluster nodes, be sure to read EntSrv5.TXT and EntSrv6.TXT.


----------------------------------------
3.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.


----------------------
3.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you
back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the
current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up
files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the
hard disk of another computer on the network.


-----------------------------
3.3   Uncompressing the Drive
-----------------------------
Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing.
Do not install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a
compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file
system compression feature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Windows NT 4.0, you could
create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with
parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using
dynamic disks, introduced with Windows 2000, you can take advantage of
similar technologies, and with Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without repartitioning or
reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. For important
information about these choices, see "Working with Volume, Mirror, or
Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" in EntSrv2.TXT.


-------------------------------
3.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


======================================================================
4.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN X86-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
x86-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an
Itanium architecture-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
Architecture-based Computer" later in this text file.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with Manage Your Server, which
you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs.

For important information to help you make the initial choices
offered by Setup, see EntSrv2.TXT and EntSrv3.TXT. For information
about unattended Setup and other options available when you start
Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this text file.


---------------------------------------------------
4.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.


4.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
--------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by
checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the
Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy
disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line
at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts
will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can
gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message
saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete
list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file,
restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.


4.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.


---------------------------------------------
4.2   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
---------------------------------------------
The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD" and
"Starting a New Installation from a Network," explain how to start
Setup for a new installation. For information about starting Setup for
an upgrade, see "Starting Setup for an Upgrade" earlier in this
text file.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.


4.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
--------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures.

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running
   Microsoft Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk
   caching. Otherwise, the Setup process (started from Winnt.exe)
   could take a long time. To enable disk caching on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can use SMARTDrive. For
   information about SMARTDrive, see the documentation for
   Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running Windows NT 4.0,
apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD ON AN X86-BASED
   COMPUTER

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD-ROM drive. This method applies only if you want to perform a
new installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform
an installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive and whether you want to
      perform a new installation (not an upgrade). Continue only if
      both are true.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.


4.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, from a
network, you either share the files directly from the CD or copy them
to a shared folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to
run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, ENTERPRISE EDITION, FROM A
   NETWORK (X86-BASED COMPUTERS ONLY)

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows Server
      2003, Enterprise Edition, connect to the shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
        Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or
        later, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
5.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
Itanium architecture-based computer. For an explanation of how
to start Setup on an x86-based computer, see "Starting Setup on
an x86-based Computer" earlier in this text file.

In computers with the Itanium processor or the Itanium 2 processor,
the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is the interface between a
computer's firmware, hardware, and operating system. The EFI defines a
new partition style called a GUID partition table (GPT), which is
available only for Itanium architecture-based computers. The
installation partition on an Itanium architecture-based computer must
be on a GPT disk. Setup automatically specifies GPT for the disk used
for installation. You can still read and write to
master boot record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most PCs, but
you cannot install on one.

You cannot access GPT disks locally from an x86-based computer. If
you want to move a disk from an Itanium architecture-based computer to
an x86-based computer, use an MBR disk. This is true regardless of
whether the disk is basic or dynamic.

Before installing, verify that you are using the correct version of
the firmware. For more information, refer to the hardware
manufacturer's documentation.

   IMPORTANT: Itanium architecture-based computers require a
   minimum 100-MB FAT partition for the operation of the EFI. This EFI
   system partition is created automatically during Setup, and it
   stores programs and information files that the EFI uses to start
   the operating system. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

Setup also creates a Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR), which is
required by the operating system. The size of this partition depends
on the size of the hard disk. On drives less than 16 GB in size, the
MSR is 32 MB. On drives greater than or equal to 16 GB, the MSR is 128
MB. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

>>>TO START SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER

   1. Immediately after turning on the computer, insert the Setup CD
      in the CD-ROM drive.

   2. When the EFI Boot Manager menu appears, select the
      CD-ROM option.

   3. When prompted, press any key to start from the CD-ROM.

   4. Follow the on-screen Setup instructions.

6.0   PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================


This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can
view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT,
     Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family, use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate
     options). With Windows NT 4.0, before starting unattended Setup,
     apply Service Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation): See "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD
     for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, in the CD-ROM
     drive and open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM
     drive, change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT,
     Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family, insert the Setup CD for Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, in the CD-ROM drive, and
     open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change
     to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the
     command options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition;
     the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
     Edition; or the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD for the 64-bit version
     of the product in the CD-ROM drive and open the command prompt
     (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then, change to the
     CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?


======================================================================
7.0   ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see EntSrv2.TXT
and EntSrv3.TXT for important background information about issues such
as partitions, file system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name
resolution. You can modify some settings after running Setup by using
the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration tools.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass
   Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.

If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer,
see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this text file.


Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
Edition, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or specify a
partition on which you want to install. You can create a partition
from the available unpartitioned space, specify an existing partition,
or delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk
space for the new installation. If you specify any action that will
cause information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm
your choice.

For more information, see the section on planning partitions for new
installations in EntSrv3.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased.

Performing a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, on a partition that contains another operating
system overwrites the existing operating system.


Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, to use
multiple languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking Regional
and Language Options in Control Panel.


Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify regional and language options by
clicking Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.

Choosing a Licensing Mode
-------------------------
Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see EntSrv2.TXT. If you are unsure which mode to use, select
"Per Server," because you can change once from "Per Server" mode to
"Per Device or Per User" mode at no cost.


Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see the "Name Resolution for
TCP/IP" section in EntSrv3.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."


Setting the Administrator Account Password
------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep a
   strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and
   Support.


Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.


Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and
Setup, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
in EntSrv3.TXT. For additional information about TCP/IP configuration,
see Help and Support Center as well as the Windows Deployment and
Resource Kits for the Windows Server 2003 family. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on
     your network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP
     provides an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your
     network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option called
     Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using
     APIPA, complete the network configuration after Setup, because
     a server using APIPA can communicate only with other computers
     using APIPA on the same network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of
     APIPA, see "IP Addresses" in EntSrv3.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS AND
   WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).

   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the address
      of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.


Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
in EntSrv3.TXT.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
8.0 CONFIGURING YOUR SERVER
======================================================================
When Setup is complete, the computer restarts. Setup has now
completed the basic installation. Manage Your Server appears on the
screen the first time you log on as the computer's administrator. You
can use Manage Your Server to install and configure server roles,
including file servers, print servers, Web and media servers, and
networking and communications servers. You can start Manage Your
Server at any time if you are logged on as an administrator. To start
Manage Your Server, click Start, and then either click Manage Your
Server or point to All Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
then click Manage Your Server.

Also at this point, you can view Help and Support Center by clicking
Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have used Windows NT
in the past, one topic you might find useful is "New ways to do
familiar tasks," which is available in the online Help topics or
through use of the Search feature in Help and Support Center.


Choosing Server Components
--------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.


======================================================================
9.0 PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE WINDOWS SERVER 2003
    FAMILY
======================================================================


After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:

Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.

How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.

Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number
     (toll-free, wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you
     call the number, a customer service representative asks for the
     Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer
     service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.

Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.


---------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.

               Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition
                    Setup Text Files, Part 5 of 6:
              Upgrading and Installing on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************
 

This part of the text file series provides information about upgrading
and installing on cluster nodes. With Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure
that users have constant access to important server-based resources.
With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users
as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node
begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Critical
applications and resources remain continuously available.

The following list of headings can help you find the information
about server clusters that applies to you. For information about basic
planning for an upgrade or a new installation, see EntSrv1.TXT,
EntSrv2.TXT, and EntSrv3.TXT. For information about running Setup,
see EntSrv4.TXT.

----------------------------
1.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
Ensure that your entire cluster solution (including your drivers as
well as your hardware) is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


--------------------------------------
1.3   Options for Upgrading Clustering
--------------------------------------
You have several options when upgrading clustering. You can:

* Upgrade the operating system on a cluster that is running Microsoft
  Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For a description
  of the ways you can do this, see "Upgrading a Cluster from
  Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2003,
  Enterprise Edition," later in this text file.

* Upgrade a cluster that is running Microsoft Windows 2000, possibly
  through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "Upgrading
  a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
  Enterprise Edition," later in this text file.

* Perform a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
  Enterprise Edition, and install the Cluster service at the same
  time. For more information about this option, see "Installing on
  Cluster Nodes" in EntSrv6.TXT.


-----------------------------
1.4   Quorum Resource Options
-----------------------------
With clusters running on Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
Edition, you can choose between three ways to set up the quorum
resource (the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the
cluster configuration data and that must always be available for the
cluster to run). These options are:

   * Single node server cluster

   * Single quorum device server cluster

   * Majority node set

Before upgrading, refer to "Quorum Resource Options" in EntSrv6.TXT
to learn more about these options.


======================================================================
2.0   UPGRADING A CLUSTER FROM WINDOWS 2000 TO WINDOWS
      SERVER 2003, ENTERPRISE EDITION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, on cluster nodes, you might be able to perform a
rolling upgrade of the operating system. In a rolling upgrade, you
sequentially upgrade the operating system on each node, making sure
that one node is always available to handle client requests. When you
upgrade the operating system, the Cluster service is automatically
upgraded also. A rolling upgrade maximizes availability of clustered
services and minimizes administrative complexity. For more
information, see the next section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade, and
understand the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your
clustered resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in
this text file. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster
nodes if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to
Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file.


-------------------------------
2.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
-------------------------------
This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the sections that follow this section.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which a fewer number
of nodes handle the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not
have to recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains
intact during the upgrade process.


2.1.1  Phases of a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------
A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2:

Phase 1: Preliminary
--------------------
Each node runs Windows 2000 Advanced Server with the
following software:

   * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
     Windows 2000 Advanced Server).

   * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more
     information, see the application documentation, and "Resource
     Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
-----------------------
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups
while you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

You are now running a mixed-version cluster. A mixed-version cluster
is a cluster in which the nodes are running different versions of the
operating system. Although mixed-version clusters are supported by
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, they are not the optimal
configuration. It is recommended that you upgrade all nodes to the
same operating system by completing the final two phases of the
rolling upgrade.

When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2
-----------------------
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final
--------------
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

   IMPORTANT: If your goal is to have more than two nodes in the
   cluster, you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the cluster
   storage. Add the additional nodes after completing the rolling
   upgrade. Before adding additional nodes, ensure that your entire
   cluster solution is compatible with products in the Windows
   Server 2003 family. For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file
   system and configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure
   cluster disks as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of
   dynamic disks such as spanned volumes (volume sets).


2.1.2  Performing a Rolling Upgrade
-----------------------------------
For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade Procedures
------------------------------------------------------------
To perform any of the cluster upgrade procedures in this text file,
you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local
computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.
If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins
group might be able to perform these procedures. As a security best
practice, consider using Run as to perform upgrade procedures. Run as
is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or
programs using a different security context. For example, you can log
on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running
Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab and then
search for "runas."

   IMPORTANT: For information about what resources are supported
   during rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   and "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this
   text file.

>>>TO PERFORM A ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000 and use
      resources that are supported during a rolling upgrade, as
      described in "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource
      Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible
      with Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   3. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to
      upgrade first.

   4. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

   5. In the details pane, click Active Groups.

   6. In the details pane, click a group, and then on the File menu,
      click Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

      The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
      moved and restarted on the other node. After the groups are
      moved, one node is idle, and the other node handles all
      client requests.

   7. Use Setup for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, to
      upgrade the paused node from Windows 2000. (For information
      about running Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.)

      Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused
      node and automatically installs clustering for
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. The node
      automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of the upgrade
      process, but is still paused and does not handle any
      cluster-related work.

         Note: As you begin the setup process, you will receive a
         warning message about using the tempdrive option for Setup.
         Provided you have followed the preceding steps, you can click
         OK and proceed with Setup without using this option.

   8. Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log on to the
      newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage Your
      Server to continue with the upgrade.

   9. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
      perform validation tests such as confirming that the operating
      system recognizes your network connections and, using Device
      Manager, ensuring that the operating system recognizes all of
      your storage devices.

  10. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and
      then on the File menu click Resume Node.

         Note: When you use Cluster Administrator for the first time
         on the upgraded node, Cluster Administrator will prompt you
         to "Open connection to cluster." In the "Cluster or server
         name" field, type a period (.). This will connect you to the
         cluster on the local upgraded node. Although you can connect
         to the cluster by typing the cluster name, if you do so you
         will be connected to the cluster on the Windows 2000 node
         and then will be required to respond to several
         warning messages.

  11. Repeat the preceding steps for the remaining node.


--------------------------------------
2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
--------------------------------------
There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restrictions are as follows:

* You can perform a rolling upgrade only if you are upgrading from
  Windows 2000 on the cluster nodes. You cannot perform a rolling
  upgrade if you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0,
  Enterprise Edition. For a description of the ways to upgrade from
  Windows NT Server 4.0, see "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows NT
  Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,"
  later in this text file.

* You cannot mix x86-based and Itanium architecture-based computers
  within the same cluster. Therefore you cannot perform a rolling
  upgrade from an x86-based computer to an Itanium
  architecture-based computer.

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. The operation of a
mixed-version cluster is complicated if a resource type that you add
to the cluster is supported in one version of the operating system but
not the other. For example, the Cluster service in Windows 
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, supports the Generic Script resource
type. However, older versions of the Cluster service do not
support it.

A mixed-version cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node
running Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, but not on a
node running Windows 2000. The Cluster service transparently sets the
possible owners of new resource types to prevent these resources from
failing over to a Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In
other words, when you view the possible owners of a new resource type,
a Windows 2000 node will not be in the list, and you will not be able
to add this node to the list. If you create such a resource during the
mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups
containing those resources will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

In order for a mixed-version cluster to work, the different versions
of the software running on each node must be prepared to communicate
with one another. This requirement leads to several basic restrictions
on the rolling-upgrade process.

* For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
  manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
  information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
  later in this text file.

* During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
  cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
  system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
  not change the settings of a printer resource).

If the preceding restriction cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.


-----------------------------------------------
2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
-----------------------------------------------
Although the Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes the resources that are supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from
Windows 2000" later in this text file.


======================================================================
RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DHCP               DHCP is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.

IIS                IIS 6.0 is not supported during a rolling upgrade.
                   When upgrading a cluster that contains an IIS
                   resource, you must follow the procedure
                   described in "Upgrades That Include an IIS
                   Resource" later in this text file.

IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.

Local Quorum       Supported during rolling upgrades.

MSDTC              Supported during rolling upgrades. However,
                   avoid creating or deleting the MSDTC resource
                   while you are operating as a mixed version
                   cluster. Instead create the MSDTC resource
                   before starting the upgrade on any node, or wait
                   until the upgrade is complete on all nodes. For
                   more information on mixed version clusters, see
                   "How Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on
                   Rolling Upgrades" earlier in this text file.

Message Queuing    Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported
(also known as     during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
MSMQ)              that includes Message Queuing, see "Upgrades
                   That Include Message Queuing Resources" later in
                   this text file.

Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.

NNTP Service       NNTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
                   You must remove any NNTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades.

Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard port monitor ports. See the
                   following section, "Upgrades That Include a
                   Print Spooler Resource."

SMTP Service       SMTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
                   You must remove any SMTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Time Service       Time Service is not supported in Windows
                   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. You must remove
                   any Time Service resources prior to upgrading.

WINS               WINS is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

Other resource     See Relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder of the
types              Setup CD for Windows Server 2003,
                   Enterprise Edition. Also see the product
                   documentation that comes with the application or
                   resource.


You cannot perform a rolling upgrade on a cluster running Windows NT
Server 4.0. Only clusters running Windows 2000 support rolling
upgrades to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.


2.3.1  Upgrades That Include a Print Spooler Resource
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) of printers
on cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Port Monitor ports). For
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

* Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
  Print Spooler resource.

* Avoid adding new printers while you are performing a rolling
  upgrade. If you do add a new printer, when you install the
  drivers for that printer, be sure to install both the driver for
  Windows 2000 and the driver for Windows Server 2003,
  Enterprise Edition, on all nodes.

* If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
  check them. Printing preferences in Windows Server 2003,
  Enterprise Edition, will not necessarily correspond to document
  defaults for the same printer in Windows 2000. This can be
  affected by differences in the drivers for the two
  operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.


--------------------------------------------------------
2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
--------------------------------------------------------
Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including:

   * Internet Information Services (IIS)
   * DHCP
   * WINS

Special procedures, described in the sections that follow, must be
used when performing an upgrade of a cluster that contains these
resources. In addition to the resource types listed previously, you
might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling
upgrades. Be sure to read Relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder of the
Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, as well as
the product documentation that comes with the application or resource.

   Note: You also cannot perform a rolling upgrade when upgrading from
   Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For more information,
   see "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
   Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition," later in this text
   file.


2.4.1  Upgrades That Include an IIS Resource
---------------------------------------------
IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. To upgrade a
clustered IIS resource, you must replace the existing IIS resource
with a Generic Script Resource. You have two options to do this; you
can perform each of the steps as described in the following procedure,
or you can use a script that is supplied with Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, which automates many of the steps.
The instructions for using the script are described in the
second procedure.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedures, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 WITHOUT USING THE PROVIDED SCRIPT ON A
   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Enterprise Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the
      resources that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Enterprise Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and
      clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the details
      pane, click the resource that you want to remove, then on the
      File menu, click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions
      on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general
      information about Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a Distributed Transaction Coordinator
      (DTC) resource on the cluster that you are upgrading, create a
      DTC resource for this cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Enterprise Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

   4. On the Windows 2000 node, note the dependencies of the IIS
      instance resource. Note resources that depend on the IIS
      resource and also note what resources IIS itself is
      dependent on.

   5. Take the group containing the IIS instance resource offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups folder. In
      the details pane, click the group containing the IIS resource,
      then on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   6. Remove any dependencies on the IIS instance resource by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder. For
      each resource that is dependent on the IIS instance resource,
      in the details pane, click the resource you want to modify,
      then on the File menu, click Properties. On the Dependencies
      tab, click Modify. Click the IIS resource in the Dependencies
      list and click the left arrow to move it to the Available
      resources list.

   7. Delete the IIS instance resource by using Cluster Administrator
      and clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the
      details pane, click the IIS instance resource, then on the File
      menu, click Delete.

   8. Move the group to a node that is running Windows
      Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and create a Generic Script
      resource by following the procedure documented in "Checklist:
      Creating a clustered IIS Web or FTP service." To find this
      procedure, click Start on an upgraded node (one of the nodes
      running Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition),
      click Help and Support, and click Availability and Scalability.
      Click Windows Clustering, click Server Clusters, click
      Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, then click Checklist:
      Creating a clustered IIS Web or FTP service.

      As part of this step, recreate the dependencies of the Generic
      Script resource identical to those of the now deleted IIS
      resource. Make everything that was dependent on the IIS resource
      dependent instead on the Generic Script resource. Also make the
      Generic Script resource dependent on everything that IIS was
      dependent on.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type is
      not supported in Windows 2000.

   9. Start the W3SVC service on this node and set the W3SVC service
      to start automatically. For more information about the W3SVC,
      see the topic titled "Internet Information Services (IIS)
      security." To find this topic, click Start on the upgraded node,
      click Help and Support, and click Internet Services. Click
      Internet Information Services, then click Internet Information
      Services (IIS) security.

  10. Bring the group containing the new Generic Script resource
      online by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups
      folder. In the details pane, click the group containing the
      Generic Script resource, then on the File menu, click
      Bring Online.

  11. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

  12. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
      Edition. Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log
      on to the newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage
      Your Server to continue with the upgrade. Once the upgrade is
      complete, start the W3SVC service on this node and set the W3SVC
      service to start automatically.

         Note: Although suitable for most situations, it is not
         necessary to upgrade all nodes but one in the first step.
         Depending on your availability needs and the number of nodes
         in your cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding
         steps by performing steps three through 11 after only one,
         two or three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one
         and three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring
         it online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.

   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Enterprise Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the
      resources that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Enterprise Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and
      clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the details
      pane, click the resource that you want to remove, then on the
      File menu, click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions
      on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general
      information about Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a Distributed Transaction Coordinator
      (DTC) resource on the cluster that you are upgrading, create a
      DTC resource for this cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
         Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that cluster
         as well.

   4. On an upgraded node, open a Command Prompt and navigate to the
      %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv directory.

   5. Type:

      iis_switch cluster_name [group_name]

      where

         * cluster_name 
           is the name of a physical node in the cluster that has been
           upgraded or the name of a virtual server.
         * group_name
           is optional, because the script will, by default, upgrade
           all IIS web and FTP resources in the cluster. However, if
           you want to upgrade only one particular group, you can
           specify the name of that resource group.
 
              IMPORTANT: The resource group that includes the IIS
              resource must be on the Windows 2000 node when you run
              the script. The script includes a step that will bring
              the group with the newly created Generic Script resource
              online. However, the script will only bring the group
              online if all resources in the group were online before
              the script was run. If the group was only partially
              online or was offline prior to the script being run,
              the script will take the entire group offline and will
              not bring any resources back online after the upgrade.
              Once the script completes, the newly created resource
              might immediately fail. This is because the W3SVC
              service is disabled. You can correct this problem by
              completing the following step.

   6. Once the script completes, take the newly created Generic Script
      resource offline, then start the W3SVC service on the upgraded
      node and set the W3SVC to start automatically. For more
      information about the W3SVC, see the topic titled "Internet
      Information Services (IIS) security." To find this topic, click
      Start on the upgraded node, click Help and Support, and click
      Internet Services. Click Internet Information Services, then
      click Internet Information Services (IIS) security.

   7. Bring the Generic Script resource online.

   8. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

   9. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
      Edition. Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log
      on to the newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage
      Your Server to continue with the upgrade. Once the upgrade is
      complete, start the W3SVC service on this node and set the
      service to start automatically.

  10. If appropriate, add the final upgraded node to the Possible
      Owners list for the newly created Generic Script resource by
      using the Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource
      folder. In the details pane, click the Generic Script resource.
      On the File menu, click Properties. On the General tab, next to
      Possible owners, click Modify.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type
      is not supported in Windows 2000.

         Notes: The script will not upgrade IIS resources that are in
         the cluster group. If you have IIS resources that are in the
         cluster group, you can instead use the procedure "To upgrade
         from Windows 2000 without using the provided script on a
         cluster that includes an IIS resource" earlier in this text
         file. The script sets the script path as
         %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\ by default. You can modify
         this path if necessary.
         Although suitable for most situations, it is not necessary to
         upgrade all nodes but one in the first step. Depending on
         your availability needs and the number of nodes in your
         cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding steps
         by performing steps two through four after only one, two or
         three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one and
         three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring it
         online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.


2.4.2   Upgrades That Include Message Queuing Resources
-------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported during a
rolling upgrade.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 ON A CLUSTER THAT CONTAINS MESSAGE
   QUEUING RESOURCES

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   2. Take all of the Message Queuing cluster resources offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder.
      In the details pane, click each Message Queuing resource, then
      on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   3. For each Message Queuing resource, take the Network Name
      resource that depends on it offline also.

   4. Upgrade all of the nodes from Windows 2000 to
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. Prior to
      upgrading, be sure to remove the resources that are not
      supported by Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
      Do this by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the
      Resource folder in the console tree. In the details pane, click
      the resource that you want to remove, then on the File menu,
      click Delete.

   5. Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log on to the
      newly upgraded nodes as an Administrator. Close Manage Your
      Server to continue with the upgrade.

   6. Bring the Network Name resources back online. Ensure that the
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource is online,
      then bring the Message Queuing resources online.


2.4.3  Last Node Rolling Upgrades
---------------------------------
If you have other resources on your cluster such as DHCP and WINS
that are not fully supported during a rolling upgrade and are not
described by other technology specific procedures listed previously
(such as IIS), you can perform a "last node rolling upgrade."

Last node rolling upgrades are similar to standard rolling upgrades.
In a last node rolling upgrade, you upgrade all nodes except the node
that contains the unsupported resources. After all other nodes are
upgraded, you then upgrade the final node containing the
identified resources.

Last node rolling upgrades are a way to accommodate resources that
cannot fail over to an older operating system from a node running
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. Be aware that these
resources can, however, fail over the other way, that is, from the
older operating system to Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO PERFORM A LAST NODE ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.
 
   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   3. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Enterprise Edition, and remove those resources. Do this by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource folder in the
      console tree. In the details pane, click the resource that you
      want to remove, then on the File menu, click Delete.

   4. Again using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades and
      are not covered by other technology specific upgrade procedures
      described previously.

   5. Move all of the resources identified in the previous step to a
      single node by double-clicking the Groups folder in the Cluster
      Administrator console tree. Click the group that contains the
      resource and then in the File menu, click Move Group.

   6. Upgrade the operating system on each of the nodes that is not
      hosting the resources moved in the previous step. Manage Your
      Server will appear when you initially log on to the newly
      upgraded nodes as an Administrator. Close Manage Your Server to
      continue with the upgrade.

   7. Move all of the resources that you moved in the earlier steps
      from the node that has not been upgraded to one of the newly
      upgraded nodes.

   8. Once all of the resources have been moved, upgrade the final
      node. After you upgrade, close the Manage Your Server dialog box
      if it is displayed.

         Note: It is not mandatory to move all of these resources to a
         single node and upgrade that node last. However, following
         the procedure as described will typically give you the
         highest availability of the resources that do not support
         rolling upgrades.


======================================================================
3.0   UPGRADING A CLUSTER FROM WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0 TO
      WINDOWS SERVER 2003, ENTERPRISE EDITION
======================================================================


You cannot perform a rolling upgrade directly from Windows NT
Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, to Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition. You instead have two options:

   * You can maintain cluster availability by performing an upgrade
     first to Windows 2000, then to Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition. If you use this method, perform an upgrade
     from Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows 2000 as documented in the
     Windows 2000 documentation. Then follow the procedures documented
     in "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition," earlier in this text file. If
     you have an IIS resource on your Windows NT Server 4.0 cluster,
     after you complete both upgrades, you must delete the unsupported
     IIS resource type by opening the Command Prompt and typing the
     following command:

     Cluster restype "IIS Virtual Root" /delete /type

   * You can perform a nonrolling upgrade directly from Windows NT
     Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, which
     will not allow you to maintain cluster availability.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3.1   Upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0 while not Maintaining
      Cluster Availability
----------------------------------------------------------------
To upgrade from Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, without the use of Windows 2000, you must
interrupt cluster availability. The steps you perform depend on what
resources are included in your cluster. For many installations, the
following procedure, "To upgrade directly from Windows NT Server 4.0
to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition," is appropriate.
However, if your cluster contains an IIS resource, you must use the
procedure "Upgrades from Windows NT Server 4.0 that Include an IIS
Resource" in EntSrv6.TXT. If you have an MSMQ or DTC resource, see
step 2 of the following procedure.

To perform the following procedure, you must be a member of the
Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is joined
to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to
perform this procedure.

>>>TO UPGRADE DIRECTLY FROM WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0 TO WINDOWS
   SERVER 2003, ENTERPRISE EDITION

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   2. Confirm that you do not have an IIS, MSMQ or DTC resource on
      your cluster. If you have an IIS resource, see "Upgrades from
      Windows NT Server 4.0 that Include an IIS Resource" in
      EntSrv6.TXT. If you have an MSMQ or DTC resource, see article
      Q315993, "HOW TO: Upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 Cluster with MSDTC
      and MSMQ Resources" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. You can
      search the Knowledge Base by going to:
 
         http://support.microsoft.com/

      and then following the instructions on the page.

   3. Ensure that Service Pack 5 or later has been applied to all
      computers that will be upgraded from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   4. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
      applications they use on the cluster.

   5. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

   6. Remove any resources that are not supported by
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, including
      NNTP Service Instance, SMTP Service Instance and Time Service
      resources. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and clicking
      the Resource folder in the console tree. In the details pane,
      click the resource that you want to remove, then on the File
      menu, click Delete.

   7. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one, or bring them to a
      shutdown state appropriate to your method of termination.

        CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device, when you
        upgrade and power on and start the operating system, it is of
        vital importance that only one node has access to the cluster
        disk. Otherwise the cluster disks can become corrupted. To
        prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all
        but one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example,
        LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect
        the cluster disks, before creating the cluster. Once the
        Cluster service is running properly on one node, the other
        nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously.

   8. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
      general information about Setup, review appropriate sections in
      EntSrv1.TXT, EntSrv2.TXT, EntSrv3.TXT, and EntSrv4.TXT.

      The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
      operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make
      configuration changes such as configuring cluster disks as
      dynamic disks. For more information, see "Limitations of server
      clusters" in Help and Support Center for
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. To open Help
      and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and
      then click Help and Support. You can also view Help and Support
      Center topics on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

      Note: When upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, the Cluster
      service user account requires the additional user right
      "Act as part of the operating system." If possible, Setup
      will grant this user right automatically. If Setup cannot
      grant the user right, you will be prompted to make this
      change. For security reasons, you must grant this user right
      to the specific user account that is used by the Cluster
      service. You cannot correct this problem by granting the user
      right to a security group of which the user account is a
      member. Typically, you must grant this user right as a local
      user right; it cannot be a domain-level user right. However,
      if your node is a domain controller, you can use the domain
      level user right. For more information on setting user
      rights, on Windows NT Server 4.0, open User Manager for
      Domains, click the Help menu in User Manager and refer to
      "Managing the User Rights Policy."

      Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log on to the
      newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage Your
      Server to continue with the upgrade.

   9. On the upgraded node, click Start, point to Programs, point to
      Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

  10. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in
      Cluster Administrator.

         CAUTION: Be sure that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
         Administrator before continuing to the next step. Otherwise
         the cluster storage could be corrupted.

  11. Shut down and turn off the upgraded node, or bring it to a
      shutdown state appropriate to your method of termination.

  12. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
      system on that node.

      Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log on to the
      newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage Your
      Server to continue with the upgrade.

  13. After the second node is upgraded, turn on the first node.
 
  14. If you want to add additional nodes to the cluster, add them
      after the first two nodes are upgraded.

         IMPORTANT: If your goal is to have more than two nodes in
         the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the
         cluster storage.

======================================================================
1.0   UPGRADES COMPARED TO NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation.
Upgrading is either replacing Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
(with Service Pack 5 or later) with a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, or replacing Windows 2000 with a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Installing, in
contrast with upgrading, means completely removing the previous
operating system, or installing a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family on a disk or disk partition with no
previous operating system.

The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between
an upgrade and a new installation:

Points to consider for an upgrade:
----------------------------------

   * With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing
     users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained.

   * With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and
     applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk,
     however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before
     beginning an upgrade.

   * Before planning to perform an upgrade, see "Operating Systems
     from Which You Can Upgrade" later in this text file.

   * If you are upgrading in a domain that includes domain
     controllers running Windows 2000, be sure to read "Upgrades in
     a Domain Containing Windows 2000 Domain Controllers" later in
     this text file.

   * If you are upgrading in a domain where all domain controllers
     run Windows NT 4.0, be sure to read "Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
     Domain" in EntSrv2.TXT.

   * If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as
     before, be sure to review applications information in
     Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD). Also, for
     the most recent information on compatible applications for
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Points to consider for a new installation:
------------------------------------------

   * If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new
     installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve (compared
     to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you the
     opportunity to modify the size or number of disk partitions, to
     make them match your requirements more closely.

   * If you want to practice careful configuration management, for
     example, for a server where high availability is important, you
     might want to perform a new installation on that server instead
     of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on which the
     operating system has been upgraded several times in the past.

   * It is possible to install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
     Edition, and also allow the computer to sometimes run another
     operating system. Setting up the computer this way, however,
     presents complexities because of file system issues. For more
     information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More
     Than One Operating System" in EntSrv3.TXT.
    
        Note: If you want to install Windows Server 2003,
        Enterprise Edition, on a computer that previously ran
        an operating system released before Microsoft Windows 2000:

               * Do not install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
                 Edition, on a compressed drive unless the drive was
                 compressed with the NTFS file system compression
                 utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace
                 volume before running Setup on it.
 
               * If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set,
                 mirror set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity,
                 and you want to run Setup for Windows
                 Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer,
                 you must prepare the disk set first. For details,
                 see "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or
                 Stripe Sets with Parity" in EntSrv2.TXT.


--------------------------------------------------
1.1   Operating Systems from Which You Can Upgrade
--------------------------------------------------
If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, into the same folder as the currently
installed operating system. You can upgrade to Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, from the following versions of
Windows:

   * Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 5 or later

   * Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, with Service
     Pack 5 or later

   * Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, with Service Pack 5 or
     later

   * Windows 2000 Server

   * Windows 2000 Advanced Server

   * Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition

        Note: If you have a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0,
        you cannot upgrade directly to a product in the
        Windows Server 2003 family. You must first upgrade
        to Windows NT 4.0 and apply Service Pack 5 before
        upgrading to a product in the Windows
        Server 2003 family.


======================================================================
2.0   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
======================================================================


Before upgrading or installing your server, make sure that you have
chosen hardware that supports Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition.


-------------------------
2.1   System Requirements
-------------------------
To ensure adequate performance, make sure that computers on which you
install or upgrade to Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
meet the following requirements:

   * For an x86-based computer:

     * One or more processors with a recommended minimum speed of 550
       MHz (minimum supported speed is 133 MHz). A maximum of eight
       processors per computer is supported. Processors from the Intel
       Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or
       compatible processors are recommended.

     * 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum (128 MB minimum
       supported, 32 gigabytes (GB) maximum).

       For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, be sure to check the
       hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:
      
          http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * For an Itanium architecture-based computer:

     * One or more processors with a minimum speed of 733 MHz. A
       maximum of eight processors per computer is supported.

     * 1 GB of RAM minimum, 64 GB maximum.

       For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, be sure to check the
       hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:
 
          http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to
     accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have
     flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is
     recommended that you allow considerably more space than the
     minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately 1.25
     GB to 2 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4 GB on an
     Itanium architecture-based computer. The larger amount of space
     is required if you are running Setup across a network instead of
     from a CD-ROM, or if you are upgrading on a FAT or FAT32
     partition (NTFS is the recommended file system).

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than other upgrades, because the
     existing user accounts database can expand by as much as a
     factor of ten during the upgrade, as Active Directory
     functionality is added.

        Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described
        in the previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual
        hard disk space used for the operating system will be more
        than the free space required for Setup, because of space
        needed for the paging file, for any optional components you
        install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and
        other Active Directory information. The usual size for the
        paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information
        about the paging file, optional components, user accounts,
        and information stored in Active Directory, see Help and
        Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after
        completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and
        Support.

   * VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher
     recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other
     pointing device.

     As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard,
     you can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor that is
     designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For
     details, see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For CD-ROM installation:

   * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

   * One or more network adapters and related cables that are designed
     for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For details,
     see the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog
     at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

For additional hardware-based functionality:

   * Appropriate hardware for the functionality you require. For
     example, if you plan to support network clients, the servers and
     clients must have appropriate network adapters and cables. As
     another example, if you require a server cluster, the entire
     cluster solution must be listed as compatible with Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. For details about your hardware,
     see the hardware compatibility information in the Windows
     Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


----------------------------
2.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
One of the most important steps to take before upgrading or
installing your server is to confirm that your hardware is compatible
with products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can do this
by running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD or
by checking the hardware compatibility information at the Windows
Catalog Web site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility,
check to see that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers
and an updated system BIOS (or for an Itanium architecture-based
computer, the correct firmware).

Regardless of whether you run a preinstallation compatibility check,
Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of
an installation or upgrade and displays a report if there are
incompatibilities.


Running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the
Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually
begin an installation or upgrade. To run the check, insert the Setup
CD in the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts
for checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to
download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run
the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that
you allow the download.

For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see
"Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later
in this text file.

Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD
in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:

d:\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly

where d represents the CD-ROM drive.


Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the
Microsoft Web site
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed
for products in the Windows Server 2003 family is to check the
hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows
Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Note that one type of hardware no longer supported is the
Micro Channel bus.


Checking drivers and system BIOS or firmware
--------------------------------------------
Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based
computer) or the correct firmware (for an Itanium architecture-based
computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these items.
For information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see
"Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer" later in this
text file.

Finally, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you
are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly
to the standards, consider taking a device inventory of the hardware
devices in your computer. For more information, see the next section,
"Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play."


2.2.1   Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This section describes steps you can take if the devices in your
computer do not use Plug and Play technology. For important
information about hardware compatibility (including the compatibility
of devices), be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file. For specific information
about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the manufacturer,
see "Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process" in EntSrv4.TXT.

Products in the Windows Server 2003 family include Plug and Play
technology so that devices (for example, video and network adapters)
can be automatically recognized by the operating system, configuration
conflicts are avoided, and you do not have to specify each device's
settings by hand. However, if you have devices that do not use Plug
and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not
implemented exactly to the standards, you might want to take steps to
avoid device configuration conflicts. This section describes steps you
can take, if you choose, to understand your device configuration
before running Setup.

To take an inventory of your devices, use the existing operating
system to obtain the current settings, such as memory address and
interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices. For example, with
Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view settings (on the
Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also choose
to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen while
starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when prompted.

At the beginning of an upgrade, the Setup program automatically takes
a device inventory as well. For devices that do not use Plug and Play,
or that are not implemented exactly to Plug and Play standards, taking
your own inventory helps prevent the following difficulties:

   * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
     the Setup program might not be able to resolve the conflict. To
     prevent this, you can take one of two approaches.

     You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and
     re-install it afterward. For information about installing and
     configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and
     Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
     Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

     As an alternative, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
     memory addresses before running Setup, so that each adapter's
     settings are unique.

   * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
     Setup to detect or enumerate them, Setup might receive
     indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you might
     need to remove these devices before running Setup, and re-install
     and configure them afterward. For information about installing
     and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and
     Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
     Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, and you decide to take a
device inventory before starting Setup.


======================================================================
ADAPTER          INFORMATION TO GATHER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Video            Adapter or chip set type and how many video adapters

Network          IRQ, I/O address, Direct Memory Address (DMA) if
                 used, connector type (for example, BNC or twisted
                 pair), and bus type

SCSI             Adapter model or chip set, IRQ, and bus type
controller

Mouse            Mouse type and port (COM1, COM2, or PS/2) or USB

I/O port         IRQ, I/O address, and DMA (if used) for each I/O
                 port

Sound adapter    IRQ, I/O address, and DMA

Universal        Which devices and hubs are attached
serial bus (USB)

PC card          Which adapters are inserted and in which slots

Plug and Play    Whether enabled or disabled in BIOS

BIOS settings    BIOS revision and date

External modem   COM port connections (COM1, COM2, and so on)

Internal modem   COM port connections; for nonstandard
                 configurations, IRQ and I/0 address

Advanced         Enabled or disabled; current setting
Configuration and
Power Interface
(ACPI); Power
Options

PCI              Which PCI adapters are inserted and in which
                 slots


2.2.2   Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer
-------------------------------------------------------------
For an x86-based computer, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a
set of software through which the operating system (or Setup)
communicates with the computer's hardware devices. The Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for
the way the BIOS works. Products in the Windows Server 2003
family support not only ACPI-compliant BIOS versions, but also some
BIOS versions based on older advanced power management (APM) and Plug
and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions provided.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

   * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
     restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
     particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
     "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

   * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, check your
     hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.


2.2.3   Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which
you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain
the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files.
Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that
update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built
into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be
replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file)
and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the
time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use
Dynamic Update when running Setup.

Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and
easy to use:

   * The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web
     site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are
     important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available
     through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not
     significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update.

   * Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required
     for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines
     your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and
     no information is saved. The only purpose is to select
     appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps
     the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary
     drivers are downloaded to your hard disk.

   * You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation
     compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup
     itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for
     running Setup. For information about running the compatibility
     check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

   * You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for
     this requires several steps. For a brief description of
     unattended Setup, see the "Planning for Unattended Setup" section
     in EntSrv4.TXT. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with
     unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see
     "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the Windows
     Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the Windows Deployment
     and Resource Kits on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can
use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to:

   http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/


======================================================================
3.0   IMPORTANT FILES TO REVIEW
======================================================================


At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup,
familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found in the \Docs
folder on the CD for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

This file contains important usage information about topics such as
application compatibility, hardware, or networking. Also familiarize
yourself with information about hardware compatibility for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
"Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

For the most recent information on compatible applications for
products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


======================================================================
4.0   UPGRADES IN A DOMAIN CONTAINING WINDOWS 2000 DOMAIN CONTROLLERS
======================================================================


If you are upgrading servers in a domain containing Windows 2000
domain controllers, there are a few points to keep in mind. The
following points are the most important:

   * The first step in planning the upgrade of a particular server is
     to check the compatibility of the hardware with products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
     "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

   * Before you upgrade the first domain controller in a domain where
     one or more domain controllers run Windows 2000, or add a domain
     controller running a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family, you must prepare the domain (and the forest in which it
     is located) using a simple tool on the Setup CD for Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. For information, see "Preparing
     for Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows 2000 Domain
     Controllers" later in this text file.

     Before preparing the domain (and the forest in which it is
     located), it is recommended that you apply Service Pack 2 or
     later to all domain controllers running Windows 2000.

   * If you have Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 installed on a
     server, when you upgrade the operating system, IIS is upgraded to
     IIS 6.0. However, for application compatibility, IIS runs in IIS
     5.0 isolation mode after the upgrade. For more information about
     IIS isolation modes, see the IIS 6.0 Help.

   * After upgrading the first server, you can read topics in Help and
     Support Center about the features that are most useful to you in
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

     One concept to read about is domain and forest functional levels,
     which are levels of Active Directory functionality related to the
     mix of operating system versions on your domain controllers. As
     you complete domain controller upgrades and reduce the number of
     different operating system versions running on them, you can
     adjust the domain and forest functional levels appropriately.

     You can view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

     To view Help and Support Center on a server running Windows 
     Server 2003, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
     click Help and Support.

If you have servers running Windows NT, also review the
following points:

   * Before running Setup, it is recommended that you review the file
     systems and partitions that exist on the server. You must have at
     least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It is recommended
     that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers in the
     domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security
     features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared
     folder can be protected only by the permissions set on that
     shared folder, not on individual files, and there is no software
     protection against local access to the partition. For more
     information, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use
     NTFS" in EntSrv3.TXT.

   * If some of your domain controllers run Windows 2000 and some run
     Windows NT, it is recommended that you upgrade the Windows NT 
     domain controllers as soon as is practical, to reduce the number
     of version differences between computers, simplify management and
     troubleshooting, and strengthen security.

   * Before you begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0, you must apply
     Service Pack 5 or later.

   * If you have servers or client computers that run Windows NT 3.51,
     it is recommended that you install or upgrade to a newer
     operating system on all these computers, or retire them from
     operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade
     domain controllers running Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon
     validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running
     Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of
     version differences between computers, simplifying management and
     troubleshooting.

After the domain and forest are prepared, there are two stages in the
upgrade of a domain controller. First you run Setup to upgrade the
operating system and then, when Setup is complete, you run the Active
Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on the screen the first
time you log on).


----------------------------------------------------------------
4.1   Preparing for Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows 2000
      Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------
Before beginning the first domain controller upgrade in a domain
where one or more domain controllers run Windows 2000, you must first
prepare the domain and the forest in which it is located. After
preparing the domain, you can begin the domain upgrade through either
of the following approaches:

   * Upgrade an existing domain controller to a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. (Be sure to check hardware
     compatibility first, as described in "Hardware Compatibility"
     earlier in this text file.)

     If you attempt to upgrade the first domain controller and you
     have not yet prepared the domain and the forest, Setup stops and
     a pop-up provides instructions.

   * Install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a member
     server in the domain, and start the Active Directory Installation
     Wizard to change the member server into a domain controller.

     If you install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a
     member server in the domain and start the Active Directory
     Installation Wizard, but you have not yet prepared the domain and
     the forest, the wizard stops and a pop-up provides instructions.

For additional background information about this type of domain
upgrade, see the previous section, "Upgrades in a Domain Containing
Windows 2000 Domain Controllers."

>>>TO PREPARE THE DOMAIN AND FOREST BEFORE UPGRADING A DOMAIN
   CONTAINING WINDOWS 2000 DOMAIN CONTROLLERS

   1. Before carrying out this procedure, it is recommended that you
      apply Service Pack 2 or later to all domain controllers running
      Windows 2000.

   2. Locate the server that is the schema master and the server that
      is the infrastructure master (they might be the same server).

      In a network of two to five servers (a network within the size
      of those discussed in this text file series), the schema master
      is usually the server on which you first installed or upgraded
      to Windows 2000. For information about identifying the schema
      master or the infrastructure master, search Windows 2000 Help
      for the topics called "Identify the schema master" and "Identify
      the infrastructure master." To view Windows 2000 Help, click
      Start and then click Help. You can also view Windows 2000 Help
      at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/advanced/help/

   3. Back up the schema master.

      You can back up other servers as well, as an appropriate part of
      preparing for upgrading, but be sure to back up the schema
      master just before taking the next step.

   4. Disconnect the schema master from the network and do not
      reestablish the connection until step 9 in this procedure.

   5. On the schema master, while Windows 2000 is running, insert the
      Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, in
      the CD-ROM drive.

   6. Open a command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive, and change to
      the \i386 folder on the CD.

   7. On the schema master, at the command prompt, type

      adprep /forestprep

         Note: To perform this step, you must be a member of the
         Enterprise Admins group and the Schema Admins group in
         Active Directory, or you must have been delegated the
         appropriate authority. As a security best practice,
         consider using Run as. Run as is a secondary logon
         method that you can use to start commands or programs
         using a different security context. For example, you
         can log on as a member of the Users group and, without
         logging off, run a command as a member of the 
         Enterprise Admins group. To find more information in
         Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running Windows 2000,
         click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
         search for "runas."

   8. After the preceding command has finished on the schema master,
      confirm that the preparation of the forest was successful. Steps
      you can take to do this include:

      * Confirm that no error messages have appeared.

      * Run any domain controller diagnostic tools that are available,
        for example, Dcdiag.exe, one of the tools available from the
        \Support\Tools folder on the Setup CD. Keep in mind that
        replication errors will appear while the domain controller is
        disconnected from the network.

      * Open Event Viewer and check the system log for errors or
        unexpected events.

   9. Evaluate the information you gathered in the previous step and
      choose accordingly:

      * If adprep /forestprep ran without errors, reconnect the schema
        master to the network and continue with the next step of this
        procedure.

      * If adprep /forestprep ran but error messages provided
        instructions for additional steps to take, follow the
        instructions and then return to the confirmation process
        described in the previous step.

      * If adprep /forestprep did not run successfully, or diagnostic
        tools such as Dcdiag.exe revealed a significant problem,
        restore the schema master from backup and investigate the
        corrective steps necessary so that adprep /forestprep can be
        run successfully.

  10. If the schema master is a different computer from the
      infrastructure master, wait for the changes made by adprep
      /forestprep to replicate from the schema master to the
      infrastructure master. Wait at least fifteen minutes, but allow
      longer (half a day or a day) if the schema and infrastructure
      masters are not at the same site. If you try to perform the
      domain preparation on the infrastructure master before the
      changes have replicated, Adprep will provide an error message
      to notify you that more time is needed.

  11. On the infrastructure master, while Windows 2000 is running,
      insert the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
      Edition, in the CD-ROM drive.

  12. Open a command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive, and change to
      the \i386 folder on the CD.

  13. On the infrastructure master, type

      adprep /domainprep

         Note: To perform this step, you must be a member of the
         Domain Admins group or the Enterprise Admins group
         in Active Directory, or you must have been delegated
         the appropriate authority. As a security best practice,
         consider using Run as. Run as is described in the
         previous note in this section.

  14. After the preceding command has finished on the infrastructure
      master, confirm that the preparation of the domain was
      successful. Steps you can take to do this include:

      * Confirm that no error messages have appeared.

      * Run any domain controller diagnostic tools that are available.

      * Open Event Viewer and check the system log for errors or
        unexpected events.

  15. Evaluate the information you gathered in the previous step and
      choose accordingly:

      * If adprep /domainprep ran without errors, continue with the
        next step of this procedure.

      * If adprep /domainprep ran but error messages provided
        instructions for additional steps to take, follow the
        instructions and then return to the confirmation process
        described in the previous step.

  16. Wait for the changes made by adprep /domainprep to replicate
      from the infrastructure master to other domain controllers. Wait
      at least fifteen minutes, but allow longer (half a day or a day)
      if you have a domain controller in a remote site. If you begin
      to upgrade one of the other domain controllers before the
      changes have replicated, a pop-up message will notify you that
      more time is needed.

After you complete this procedure, you can leave your domain
controllers running Windows 2000 for an indefinite length of time, or
you can begin the domain controller upgrade immediately.

This document provides late-breaking or other information that
supplements the documentation for the Windows Server 2003 family.

Before you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family, print
and read this document for critical pre-installation information 
concerning this release. For the most up-to-date list of supported 
hardware, see the hardware compatibility information in the Windows 
Catalog (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/). In addition, 
print and read the following files located in the \Docs folder on your
operating system disc:

   * Setup instructions

   * Release notes (relnotes.htm), important compatibility and
     postinstallation information

New features are described in detail in Help and Support Center.
To view Help and Support Center in the Windows Server 2003 family, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

======================================================================
2.0 Pre-installation Notes
======================================================================

2.1 Check Minimum Hardware Requirements
=======================================

You should read article 814617, "System Requirements in Windows Server
2003" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http://support.microsoft.com/) 
to check for any updated hardware requirements for installing and 
running products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

2.2 Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0
===========================================

Products: Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition 

Because of increased security measures, the World Wide Web Publishing
Service (WWW service) is not enabled by default in these products
after you upgrade from the Windows 2000 Server family with IIS 5.0. If
you have already upgraded, you can start the WWW service by using the
Services snap-in as described in relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder on
the operating system disc.

If you have not yet upgraded and you want the WWW service to be
enabled by default after you upgrade, you must perform one of the
following steps before you start the upgrade:
  
  * If you have not already done so, run the IIS Lockdown Tool on the
    computer that you want to upgrade. 
  
    The IIS Lockdown Tool reduces the attack surface of your server by
    disabling unnecessary features and gives you the choice to
    enable and customize features for your site. This tool is
    available from the "IIS Lockdown Tool" page on the Microsoft Web
    site 
    (http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/recommended
    /iislockdown/default.asp).

  * Create the registry key RetainW3SVCStatus under the 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC node, 
    and then add a DWORD value of any name equal to 1. For example, 
    create the key
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC
    \RetainW3SVCStatus\do_not_disable with the DWORD value of 1.
  
CAUTION: 
Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system.
Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued
data on the computer.
	
 * Add the entry "DisableWebServiceOnUpgrade = false" to the script
   that you will use to perform an unattended installation.
   After the upgrade is complete, ensure that all unnecessary IIS
   features have been removed or disabled and that the enabled features
   are configured with the highest security settings that your
   organization can support. 

For more information, see the topics "What's Changed" and "Security
Best Practices" in IIS 6.0 Help.

2.3 Security restrictions on viewing Web pages and running executable
    files
======================================================================

The default security settings in Internet Explorer are more
restrictive in the Windows Server 2003 family than in earlier versions
of Windows. When you upgrade, any settings that do not match the new
default settings are overwritten. These changes decrease the exposure
of your servers to attacks that are launched through Web content.
However, users will not be able to view many Web pages correctly when
using the default security settings. To allow users to see these Web
pages correctly, you must explicitly grant access. In addition, users
will not be able to run executable files from Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) shared folders until you or the users have added the
shared computer to the Local intranet security zone in Internet
Explorer. 

For more information about security settings and how to change them,
see relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder on the operating system disc.

                    Setup Text Files, Part 6 of 6:
              Upgrading and Installing on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************
 

This part of the text file series provides information about upgrading
and installing on cluster nodes. With Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that
users have constant access to important server-based resources. With
clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as
one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node
begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Critical
applications and resources remain continuously available.

The following list of headings can help you find the information
about server clusters that applies to you. For information about basic
planning for an upgrade or a new installation, see EntSrv1.TXT,
EntSrv2.TXT, and EntSrv3.TXT. For information about running
Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

----------------------------------------------
   3.2 UPGRADES FROM WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0 THAT
      INCLUDE AN IIS RESOURCE
----------------------------------------------
To upgrade a clustered IIS resource, you must replace the existing
IIS resource with a Generic Script Resource. Be aware that the
following procedure is only applicable when upgrading directly from
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition.

To perform the following procedure, you must be a member of the
Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is joined
to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to
perform this procedure.

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0 ON A CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN
   IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   2. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
      applications they use on the cluster.

   3. Ensure that Service Pack 5 or later has been applied to all
      computers that will be upgraded from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
      Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.

   4. Stop the applications that are made available through
      the cluster.

   5. Remove any resources that are not supported by Windows
      Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, including NNTP Service
      Instance, SMTP Service Instance and Time Service resources. Do
      this by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource
      folder in the console tree. In the details pane, click the
      resource that you want to remove, then on the File menu,
      click Delete.

   6. Set the Cluster service on all nodes to start manually.

   7. Shut down and turn off the node that does not contain the IIS
      resource, or bring it to a shutdown state appropriate to your
      method of termination.

         CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device,
        when you upgrade and power on and start the operating system,
        it is of vital importance that only one node has access to the
        cluster disk. Otherwise the cluster disks can become
        corrupted. To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks,
        shut down all but one cluster node, or use other techniques
        (for example, LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning)
        to protect the cluster disks, before creating the cluster.
        Once the Cluster service is running properly on one node, the
        other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously.

   8. On the running node, note the dependencies of the IIS instance
      resource. Note the resources that depend on the IIS resource and
      also note what resources IIS itself is dependent on.

   9. Take the group containing the IIS instance resource offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups folder. In
      the details pane, click the group containing the IIS resource,
      then on the File menu, click Take Offline.

  10. Remove any dependencies on the IIS instance resource by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder. For
      each resource that is dependent on the IIS instance resource,
      in the details pane, click the resource you want to modify, then
      on the File menu, click Properties. On the Dependencies tab,
      click Modify. Click the IIS resource in the Dependencies list
      and click the left arrow to move it to the Available resources
      list.

  11. Delete the IIS instance resource by using Cluster Administrator
      and clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the
      details pane, click the IIS instance resource, then on the File
      menu, click Delete.

  12. Delete the unsupported resource type. Open the Command Prompt
      and type the following command and press ENTER:
  	Cluster restype "IIS Virtual Root" /delete /type

  13. Stop the Cluster service on the remaining node.

  14. Upgrade the operating system on the running node. For general
      information about running Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

      The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
      operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make
      configuration changes such as configuring cluster disks as
      dynamic disks. After you upgrade, close Manage Your Server if
      it is displayed.

         Note: When upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
         Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, the Cluster
         service user account requires the additional user right "Act
         as part of the operating system." If possible, Setup will
         grant this user right automatically. If Setup cannot grant
         the user right, you will be prompted to make this change.
         For security reasons, you must grant this user right to the
         specific user account that is used by the Cluster Server
         service. You cannot correct this problem by granting the user
         right to a security group of which the user account is a
         member. Typically, you must grant this user right as a local
         user right; it cannot be a domain-level user right. However,
         if your node is a domain controller, you can use the domain
         level user right.
         Manage Your Server will appear when you initially log on to
         the newly upgraded node as an Administrator. Close Manage
         Your Server to continue with the upgrade. For more
         information on setting user rights, on
         Windows NT Server 4.0, open User Manager for Domains, click
         the Help menu in User Manager and refer to "Managing
         the User Rights Policy."

  15. Start the Cluster service on the upgraded node.

  16. Reconfigure the Cluster service on the upgraded node to start
      automatically.

  17. Shut down and turn off the upgraded node, or bring it to a
      shutdown state appropriate to your method of termination.

  18. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
      system on that node. Manage Your Server will appear when you
      initially log on to the newly upgraded node as an Administrator.
      Close Manage Your Server to continue with the upgrade.

         CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device,
         when you upgrade and power on and start the operating system,
         it is of vital importance that only one node has access to
         the cluster disk. Otherwise the cluster disks can become
         corrupted. To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks,
         shut down all but one cluster node, or use other techniques
         (for example, LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning)
         to protect the cluster disks, before creating the cluster.
         Once the Cluster service is running properly on one node,
         the other nodes can be installed and configured
         simultaneously.

  19. After the second node is upgraded, start the Cluster service on
      the second upgraded node. The node automatically rejoins the
      existing cluster.

  20. Reconfigure the Cluster service on the upgraded node to start
      automatically.

  21. Turn on the first node.

  22. On one of the upgraded nodes, click Start, point to Programs,
      point to Administrative Tools, and then click
      Cluster Administrator.

  23. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in
      Cluster Administrator.

         CAUTION: Be sure that the cluster disks are online in
         Cluster Administrator before continuing to the next step.
         When the disks are online, it means that the Cluster service
         is working, which means that only one node can access the
         cluster storage at any given time. Otherwise the cluster
         storage could be corrupted.

  24. If you do not already have a Distributed Transaction Coordinator
      (DTC) resource on the cluster that you are upgrading, create a
      DTC resource on this cluster.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Enterprise Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

  25. On the node that used to contain the IIS resource, create a
      Generic Script resource by following the procedure documented
      in "Checklist: Creating a clustered IIS Web or FTP service." To
      find this procedure, click Start on the upgraded node, click
      Help and Support, and click Availability and Scalability. Click
      Windows Clustering, click Server Clusters, click Checklists:
      Creating Server Clusters, then click Checklist: Creating a
      clustered IIS Web or FTP service. You can also view this Help
      and Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

      Recreate the dependencies of the Generic Script resource
      identical to those of the now deleted IIS resource. Make
      everything that was dependent on the IIS resource dependent
      instead on the Generic Script resource. In addition, make the
      Generic Script resource dependent on everything that IIS was
      dependent on.

  26. Start the W3SVC service on all nodes and set the service to
      start automatically. For more information about the W3SVC, see
      the topic titled "Internet Information Services (IIS)
      security." To find this topic, click Start on the upgraded node,
      click Help and Support, and click Internet Services. Click
      Internet Information Services, then click Internet Information
      Services (IIS) security. You can also view this Help and Support
      Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

  27. Bring the group containing the new Generic Script resource
      online by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources
      folder. In the details pane, click the Generic Script resource,
      then on the File menu click Bring Online.

  28. Using IIS, start the Web site.

  29. If you want to add additional nodes to the cluster, add them
      after the first two nodes are upgraded.

         IMPORTANT: If your goal is to have more than two nodes
         in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the
         cluster storage. Before adding additional nodes, ensure that
         your entire cluster solution is compatible with products in
         the Windows Server 2003 family.

   4.0 INSTALLING ON CLUSTER NODES
======================================================================


Before beginning the installation of a server cluster, review
EntSrv1.TXT, EntSrv2.TXT, EntSrv3.TXT, and EntSrv4.TXT for general
information about Setup. Also see the list of resources in "Other
Sources of Information" in EntSrv5.TXT.

For information about upgrading on cluster nodes, see the list of
sections at the beginning of this text file.

For information about installing on cluster nodes, see the sections
that follow. These sections provide important information about:

   * How to plan for a new cluster installation

   * Decisions that you need to make regarding your quorum resource
     (the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
     configuration data and that must always be available for the
     cluster to run)


---------------------------------------
   4.1 Planning for Cluster Installation
---------------------------------------
Before carrying out cluster installation, you need to plan hardware
and network details.

   CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device, before 
   creating a cluster, when you turn on the computer and start the
   operating system, it is very important that only one node has
   access to the cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can
   become corrupted. To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks,
   shut down all but one cluster node, or use other techniques (for
   example, LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to
   protect the cluster disks, before creating the cluster. Once the
   Cluster service is running properly on one node, the other nodes
   can be installed and configured simultaneously. Each node of your
   cluster must be running Windows Server 2003,
   Enterprise Edition.

In your planning, review the following items:

Cluster hardware and drivers
----------------------------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family. Confirm that your
entire cluster solution is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).

Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
installing cluster hardware. Otherwise the cluster storage could be
corrupted. If your cluster hardware includes a SCSI bus, be sure to
carefully review any instructions about termination of the SCSI bus
and configuration of SCSI IDs.

To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.


Network adapters on the cluster nodes
-------------------------------------
In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
adapter will carry. The following list provides details about the
types of communication that an adapter can carry:

   * Only node-to-node communication (private network). This implies
     that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry
     other communication.

     For node-to-node communication, you connect the network adapter
     to a private network that is used exclusively within the cluster.
     Note that if the private network uses a single hub or network
     switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential point of
     failure in your cluster.

     The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet but you can use
     virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
     nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
     must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
     appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective
     of the Windows operating system running on the nodes. To avoid
     single points of failure, use independent VLAN hardware for the
     different paths between the nodes.

     If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, it is
     a best practice for the adapters for those networks to use static
     IP addresses instead of DHCP.

   * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network). This
     implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
     carry other communication.

   * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
     network). When you have multiple network adapters per node, a
     network adapter that carries both kinds of communication can
     serve as a backup for other network adapters.

   * Communication unrelated to the cluster. If a clustered node also
     provides services unrelated to the cluster, and there are enough
     adapters in the cluster node, you might want to use one adapter
     for carrying communication unrelated to the cluster.

The nodes of a cluster must be connected by two or more local area
networks (LANs); at least two networks are required to prevent a
single point of failure. A server cluster whose nodes are connected by
only one network is not a supported configuration. The adapters,
cables, hubs, and switches for each network must fail independently.
This usually implies that the components of any two networks must be
physically independent.

At least two networks must be configured to handle "All
communications (mixed network)" or "Internal cluster communications
only (private network)."

The recommended configuration for two adapters is to use one adapter
for the private (node-to-node only) communication and the other
adapter for mixed communication (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster
communication). Do not use teaming network adapters on the
private network.

If you use fault tolerant network adapters, create multiple private
networks instead of a single fault-tolerant network.

Do not configure a default gateway or DNS or WINS server on the
private network adapters. Do not configure private network adapters to
use name resolution servers on the public network; otherwise a name
resolution server on the public network might map a name to an IP
address on the private network. If a client then received that IP
address from the name resolution server, it might fail to reach the
address because no route from the client to the private network
address exists.

Configure WINS and/or DNS servers on the public network adapters. If
Network Name resources are used on the public networks, set up the DNS
servers to support dynamic updates; otherwise the Network Name
resources may not fail over correctly. Also, configure a default
gateway on the public network adapters. If there are multiple public
networks in the cluster, configure a default gateway on only one
of these.

When you use either the New Server Cluster Wizard or the Add Nodes
Wizard to install clustering on a node that contains two network
adapters, by default the wizard configures both of the network
adapters for mixed network communications. As a best practice,
reconfigure one adapter for private network communications only. For
more information, see "Change how the cluster uses a network" in Help
and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start,
and then click Help and Support. You can also view Help and Support
Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Consider choosing a name for each connection that tells what it is
intended for. The name will make it easier to identify the connection
whenever you are configuring the server.

Manually configure the communication settings, such as Speed, Duplex
Mode, Flow Control and Media Type of each cluster network adapter. Do
not use automatic detection. You must configure all of the cluster
network adapters to use the same communication settings.

The adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different
subnet masks.

Do not use the same IP address for two network adapters, even if they
are connected to two different networks.

   Notes: Confirm that your entire cluster solution is
   compatible with the products in the Windows Server 2003
   family. For more information, see "Cluster hardware and drivers"
   earlier in this section.

   If you use a crossover cable to implement a private network, when
   the cluster is created on the first node the second node should be
   turned on but stopped in the BIOS or at the startup menu. In this
   state, the Media Sense feature of Windows might not recognize the
   network adapter as connected. If you continue creating the cluster,
   the crossover cable will be detected when you start the second
   node. The network will be established in the default mode, which
   is mixed. You can then change the network mode to private using
   Cluster Administrator.


Cluster IP address
------------------
Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
DHCP for this address.


IP addressing for cluster nodes
-------------------------------
Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the individual cluster
nodes. Each network adapter on each node requires IP addressing. It is
a best practice to assign each network adapter a static IP address. As
an alternative, you can provide IP addressing through DHCP. If you use
static IP addresses, set the addresses for each linked pair of network
adapters (linked node-to-node) to be on the same subnet.

Note that if you use DHCP for the individual cluster nodes, it can
act as a single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster
nodes so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses,
temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary unavailability
of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use DHCP, evaluate ways
to ensure availability of DHCP services, and consider the possibility
of using long leases for the cluster nodes. This helps to ensure that
they always have a valid IP address.


Cluster name
------------
Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is the
name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. (The
actual applications running on the cluster typically have different
network names.) The cluster name must be different from the domain
name, from all computer names on the domain, and from other cluster
names on the domain.


Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes
---------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.


Operator user account for installing and configuring the
Cluster service
--------------------------------------------------------
To install and configure the Cluster service, you must be using an
account that is in the local Administrators group on each node. As
you install and configure each node, if you are not using an account
in the local Administrators group, you will be prompted to provide the
logon credentials for such an account.


Cluster service user account
----------------------------
Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the name
and password under which the Cluster service will run. You need to
supply this user name and password during cluster installation.

It is best if the Cluster service user account is an account not used
for any other purpose. If you have multiple clusters, set up a unique
Cluster service user account for each cluster. The account must be a
domain account; it cannot be a local account. However, do not make
this account a domain administrator account because it does not need
domain administrator user rights.

As part of the cluster setup process, the Cluster service user
account is added to the local Administrators group on each node. As
well as being a member of the local Administrators group, the Cluster
service user account requires an additional set of user rights:

   * Act as part of the operating system.

   * Back up files and directories.

   * Adjust memory quotas for a process.

   * Increase scheduling priority.

   * Log on as a service.

   * Restore files and directories.

These user rights are also granted to the Cluster service user
account as part of the cluster setup process. Be aware that the
Cluster service user account will continue to have these user rights
even after all nodes are evicted from the cluster. The risk that this
presents is mitigated by the fact that these user rights are not
granted domain wide, but rather only locally on each former node.
However, remove this account from each evicted node if it is no
longer needed.

Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the Cluster service
user account (follow your organization's policies for password
renewal).


Volume for important cluster configuration information
(checkpoint and log files)
------------------------------------------------------
Plan on setting aside a volume on your cluster storage for holding
important cluster configuration information. This information makes up
the cluster quorum resource, which is needed when a cluster node stops
functioning. The quorum resource provides node-independent storage of
crucial data needed by the cluster. For important information on
quorum resource options, see "Quorum Resource Options" later in this
text file.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. It is
recommended that you do not store user data on any volume in the
quorum resource.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration
   for the cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all
   partitions formatted as NTFS (they can be either compressed or
   uncompressed). Partition and format all disks on the cluster
   storage device before adding the first node to your cluster. Do
   not configure them as dynamic disks, and do not use spanned
   volumes (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks. For
   the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
   cluster disks on the cluster storage device must be partitioned as
   MBR and not as GPT disks.


-----------------------------
   4.2 Quorum Resource Options
-----------------------------
With server clusters on Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
you can now choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource
(the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run).

The first is a single node server cluster, which has been available
in the past and continues to be supported. A single node cluster is
often used for development and testing and can be configured with, or
without, external cluster storage devices. For single node clusters
without an external cluster storage device, the local disk is
configured as the cluster quorum device.

The second option is a single quorum device server cluster, which has
also been available in earlier Windows versions. This model places the
cluster configuration data on a shared cluster storage device that all
nodes can access. This is the most common model and is recommended for
most situations. You might choose the single quorum device model if
all of your cluster nodes are in the same location and you want to
take advantage of the fact that such a cluster continues supporting
users even if only one node is running.

The third option, which is new for Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, is a "majority node set." A majority node set is a
single quorum resource from a server-cluster perspective; however, the
cluster configuration data is actually stored on multiple disks across
the cluster. The majority node set resource ensures that the cluster
configuration data is kept consistent across the different disks.

In the majority node set model, every node in the cluster uses a
directory on its own local system disk to store the cluster
configuration data. If the configuration of the cluster changes, that
change is reflected across the different disks. Be aware that it is
also possible to have shared storage devices in a majority node set
cluster. The exact configuration depends on the requirements for your
installation.

Only use a majority node set cluster in targeted scenarios, such as: 

   * Geographically dispersed cluster: A cluster that spans
     multiple sites.

   * Eliminating single points of failure: Although when using a
     single cluster storage device the quorum disk itself can be made
     highly available via RAID, the controller port or the Host Bus
     Adapter (HBA) itself may be a single point of failure.

   * Clusters with no shared disks: There are some specialized
     configurations that need tightly consistent cluster features
     without having shared disks.

   * Clusters that host applications that can fail over, but where
     there is some other, application-specific way, to replicate or
     mirror data between nodes: For example, this model is useful if
     you use database log shipping for keeping a SQL database state
     up to date.

Do not configure your cluster as a majority node set cluster unless
it is part of a cluster solution offered by your Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM), Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or Independent
Hardware Vendor (IHV).


   4.2.1 Cluster Model Considerations
-----------------------------------
Before implementing your cluster, consider what type of quorum
resource solution you plan to use. Take into consideration the
following differences between single quorum device clusters and
majority node set clusters.

   Note: The following information is presented to help you
   make basic decisions about the placement and management of your
   cluster nodes and quorum resource. It does not provide all the
   details about the requirements for each cluster model, or how each
   model handles failover situations. If you are not sure which model
   to use or where you want to place your cluster nodes, install
   Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on the first cluster
   node, then consult the on-line help cluster documentation in Help
   and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
   Edition. See "Using a Majority Node Set" later in this text file
   for more information on how to access Help and Support Center.


Node failover behavior
----------------------
The failover behavior of the majority node set is significantly
different from the behavior of the single quorum device model:

   * Using the single quorum device model, you can maintain cluster
     availability with only a single operational node.

   * If you use a majority node set, more than half, or (Number of
     nodes configured in the cluster/2) + 1 nodes must be operational
     to maintain cluster availability. The following table shows the
     number of node failures that a given majority node set cluster
     can tolerate yet continue to operate:


   ===================================================================

   NUMBER OF NODES       NUMBER OF NODE            NUMBER OF NODES
   CONFIGURED IN THE     FAILURES ALLOWED          NEEDED TO CONTINUE
   CLUSTER               BEFORE CLUSTER FAILURE    CLUSTER OPERATIONS
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   2                     0                         2
   3                     1                         2
   4                     1                         3
   5                     2                         3
   6                     2                         4
   7                     3                         4
   8                     3                         5



Geographic considerations
-------------------------
You would commonly use a single quorum resource model if all nodes in
your cluster will be in the same geographical location. As part of
this requirement, your nodes must be connected to the same physical
storage device.

A majority node set on the other hand would typically be appropriate
if you have geographically dispersed nodes. The cluster configuration
data is stored locally on each node on a file share that is shared out
to the other nodes on the network. However, those shares must always
be accessible or nodes can fail.

There are other specific requirements for geographically dispersed
clusters, including the requirement that round-trip latency of the
network between cluster nodes be a maximum of 500 milliseconds. For
information on cluster solutions that meet all requirements for a
geographically dispersed cluster, refer to hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at: 

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


Hardware
--------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family of products. For
both cluster models, confirm that your system or hardware components,
including your cluster disks, are compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


   4.2.2 Using a Majority Node Set
---------------------------------
This section tells how to obtain additional information about the
majority node set model. For a description of a majority node set,
see "Quorum Resource Options" earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: Before implementing a majority node set, it is
   highly recommended that you read the online clustering
   documentation in Help and Support Center to thoroughly understand
   all the considerations, requirements, and restrictions for each
   type of quorum resource solution.

======================================================================
   5.0 BEGINNING THE CLUSTER INSTALLATION ON THE FIRST CLUSTER NODE
======================================================================


The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

   IMPORTANT: Carefully review your network cables after
   connecting them. Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for
   example, private network connected to public).


   5.1 Initial Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI When Using a
      SCSI Shared Storage Device
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using a SCSI shared storage device, when you first attach
your cluster hardware (the shared bus and cluster storage), be sure to
work only from the firmware configuration screens on the cluster nodes
(a node is a server in a cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS
configuration screens. On an Itanium architecture-based computer, use
the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration screens. The
instructions from your manufacturer will describe whether these
configuration screens are displayed automatically or whether you must,
after turning on the computer, press specific keys to access them.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI
configuration process. Remain in the BIOS or EFI configuration
screens, and do not allow the operating system to start, during this
initial installation phase. Complete the following steps while the
cluster nodes are still displaying BIOS or EFI configuration screens,
before starting the operating system on the first cluster node.

   IMPORTANT: If your cluster nodes are Itanium architecture-based
   computers, use a fibre channel bus instead of a SCSI bus.

   * Make sure you understand and follow the manufacturer's
     instructions for termination of the SCSI bus.

   * Make sure that each device on the shared bus (both SCSI
     controllers and hard disks) has a unique SCSI ID. If the SCSI
     controllers all have the same default ID (often it is SCSI ID 7),
     change one controller to a different SCSI ID, such as SCSI ID 6.
     If there is more than one disk that will be on the shared SCSI
     bus, each disk must also have a unique SCSI ID. In addition, make
     sure that the bus is not configured to reset SCSI IDs
     automatically on startup (otherwise the IDs will change from the
     settings you specify).

   * Ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from all
     cluster nodes (while remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration
     screens).


   5.2 Initial Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI When Using a
      Fibre Channel Shared Storage Device or No Shared Storage Device
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Turn on a single node. Leave all other nodes turned off.

   * During this initial installation phase, remain in the BIOS or
     Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration process, and do
     not allow the operating system to start. While viewing the BIOS
     or EFI configuration screens, ensure that you can scan the bus
     and see the drives from the active cluster node. On a 32-bit
     computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer, use the EFI configuration screens.
     Consult the instructions from your manufacturer to determine
     whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically
     or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press
     specific keys to access them. Follow the manufacturer's
     instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI
     configuration process.


   5.3 Final Steps to Complete the Installation
----------------------------------------------
If you have not already installed Windows Server 2003,
Enterprise Edition, on the first cluster node, install it before
proceeding. For information about decisions you must make, such as
decisions about licensing, see EntSrv2.TXT and EntSrv3.TXT. For
information about running Setup, see EntSrv4.TXT.

After you complete the BIOS or EFI configuration, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and complete the configuration of the
Cluster service using Cluster Administrator.

With the Cluster Administrator New Server Cluster Wizard, you can
choose between Typical (full) configuration and Advanced (minimum)
configuration options. Typical configuration is appropriate for most
installations and results in a completely configured cluster. Use the
Advanced configuration option only for clusters that have complex
storage configurations that the New Server Cluster Wizard cannot
validate or for configurations in which you do not want the cluster
to manage all of the storage. The following examples describe each
situation:

   * In some complex storage solutions, such as a fiber channel
     switched fabric that contains several switches, a particular
     storage unit might have a different identity on each computer in
     the cluster. Although this is a valid storage configuration, it
     violates the storage validation heuristics in the New Server
     Cluster Wizard. If you have this type of storage solution, you
     might receive an error when you are trying to create a cluster
     using the Typical configuration option. If your storage
     configuration is set up correctly, you can disable the storage
     validation heuristics and avoid this error by restarting the New
     Server Cluster Wizard, selecting the Advanced configuration
     option instead.

   * On particular nodes in a cluster, you may want to have some disks
     that are to be clustered and some disks that are to be kept
     private. The Typical configuration option configures all disks as
     clustered disks and creates cluster resources for them all.
     However, with the Advanced configuration option, you can keep
     certain disks private because this configuration creates a
     cluster in which only the quorum disk is managed by the cluster
     (if you chose to use a physical disk as the quorum resource).
     After the cluster is created, you must then use Cluster
     Administrator to add any other disks that you want the cluster to
     manage.

If you are using a shared storage device: Before creating a cluster,
when you turn the computer on and start the operating system, it is
very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk.
Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the
corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node,
or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective
presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks before creating
the cluster. Also, before starting the installation of the second and
subsequent nodes, ensure that all disks that are to be managed by the
cluster have disk resources associated with them. If these disks do
not have disk resources associated with them at this time, the disk
data will be corrupted because the disks will not be protected and
multiple nodes will attempt to connect to them at the same time.

>>> TO SET UP YOUR CLUSTER USING CLUSTER ADMINISTRATOR 

  1. Open Cluster Administrator by clicking Start, pointing to
     Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking
     Cluster Administrator.

  2. In the Open Connection to Cluster dialog box that appears, in
     Action, select Create new cluster, then click OK.

  3. The New Server Cluster Wizard appears. Click Next to continue.

  4. Upon completion of the New Server Cluster Wizard, click Finish.
  
        IMPORTANT: During the cluster creation process (using the
        Quorum button on the Proposed Cluster Configuration page) you
        will be able to select a quorum resource type (that is, a
        Local Quorum resource, Physical Disk or other storage class
        device resource, or Majority Node Set resource). For
        information on how these quorum resource types relate to the
        different cluster models, see "Quorum Resource Options"
        earlier in this text file.

Do not use Manage Your Server or the Configure Your Server Wizard to
configure cluster nodes.

      OPERATING SYSTEM
======================================================================


On a computer with an appropriate disk configuration (outlined in the
table later in this section), you can install more than one operating
system, and then choose between the operating systems each time you
restart the computer.

   Note: On an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can
   install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of
   Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or the 64-bit version
   of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. In the sections
   that follow, information about operating systems that you cannot
   install does not apply. For example, information about
   Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not apply
   to an Itanium architecture-based computer.

For example, on an x86-based computer, you could set up a server to
run Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, most of the time,
but allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition, to support an older application. (However, to do this you
would need to make specific file system choices and would need Service
Pack 5 or later, as described in "Multiple Operating Systems and File
System Compatibility" and "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.) During restarts, a display would
appear for a specified number of seconds, allowing you to select
between the two operating systems. (You can specify a default
operating system that will run if no selection is made during the
restart process.)

The following table shows the disk configurations on which you can
install more than one operating system.

   IMPORTANT: You must follow the requirements in the following table.
   For example, on a basic disk, you must install each operating
   system, including Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
   in a separate partition. This ensures that each operating system
   does not overwrite crucial files that are needed by another
   operating system.


======================================================================
DISK CONFIGURATION   REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic disk or disks  You can install multiple operating systems,
                     including Windows NT 4.0 and earlier
                     operating systems, on a basic disk. Each
                     operating system must be on a separate
                     partition or logical drive on the disk.

Single dynamic disk  You can install only one operating system.

                     However, if you used Windows 2000 or Microsoft
                     Windows XP to change a disk with no partitions
                     directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the
                     disk to basic before you can install an operating
                     system on it. For more information, see "Working
                     with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text
                     file.

Multiple dynamic     Each dynamic disk can contain one installation
disks                of Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in
                     the Windows Server 2003 family. No other
                     operating systems can start from a dynamic disk.

                     However, if you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP
                     to change a disk with no partitions directly
                     to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
                     to basic before you can install an operating
                     system on it. For more information, see "Working
                     with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text
                     file.
Master boot record   You cannot start operating systems from an
(MBR) disk on an     MBR disk on an Itanium architecture-based
Itanium              computer. You must use a GPT disk for this

--------------------------------------------------
8.1   Reasons to Install Only One Operating System
--------------------------------------------------
Setting up a computer so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems at startup does have an advantage: it allows you to
use applications that run only with a particular operating system.
However, there are definite reasons to install only one
operating system:

   * Each operating system uses valuable disk space.

   * Compatibility issues, especially file system compatibility, can
     be complex. For more information, see "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this text file.

   * On a dynamic disk (a storage type available with products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family), you can have only one
     operating system per disk. Dynamic disks also will not work
     with some operating systems. For more information, see the
     table in the previous section, "Deciding Whether a Computer
     Will Contain More Than One Operating System."

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer.
     With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have
     other options for system recovery. For example, if you have
     a problem with a newly installed device driver, you can use
     Safe Mode, in which Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
     Edition, restarts with default settings and the minimum number
     of drivers. For more information about Safe Mode and other
     options for system recovery, see Help and Support Center.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2   Requirements for Setting Up a Computer with Multiple Operating
      Systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you decide to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

   Note: On an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can install
   Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of Windows
   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or the 64-bit version of
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. In the sections that
   follow, information about operating systems that you cannot install
   does not apply. For example, information about Windows 2000 or
   Windows NT 4.0 does not apply to an Itanium architecture-based
   computer.

On computers that contain Microsoft Windows 98 or Microsoft Windows
Millennium Edition and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition must be installed on a
     basic disk on a partition formatted with FAT or FAT32. If
     either Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition is not
     installed on the system partition, which is almost always the
     first partition on the disk, the system partition must also
     be formatted with FAT or FAT32.

   * Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, could be
     overwritten.

   * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
     Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
     text file.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition:

   * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility"
     and "Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition," later in this text file.

On computers that contain some combination of Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, with Windows 2000 or Windows XP, or
that contain multiple partitions with products in the Windows
Server 2003 family:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition or, for
     dynamic disks, on a different disk, and install the
     applications used with an operating system on the same disk
     or partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it in two places.

   * For an x86-based computer, choose any product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family for installation on a specific
     partition. For example, you could install Windows
     Server 2003, Standard Edition, in one location and Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, in another.

   * For an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can choose among
     Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   * If Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition, are installed, Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition, must be installed last. Otherwise important
     files that are needed for starting Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition, could be overwritten.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation. Because a unique security
     identifier (SID) is used for each installation on a domain,
     the computer name for each installation must be unique, even
     for multiple installations on the same computer.

   * If you want to use the Encrypting File System (EFS), you must
     take certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be
     available from each of the installations. For more information,
     see "Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System"
     later in this text file.


--------------------------------------------------------------
8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------------
On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. (For more
information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.)

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it is more
efficient and reliable, and supports important features including
Active Directory and domain-based security. With NTFS, however, you
need to take file system compatibility into account when considering
whether to set up a computer to contain more than one operating
system, because with Windows 2000 and the Windows Server 2003
family, NTFS has new features in addition to those in Windows NT.
Files that use any new features will be completely usable or readable
only when the computer is started with Windows 2000 or a product in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For example, a file that uses the
new encryption feature will not be readable when the computer is
started with Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0,
Enterprise Edition, which were released before the encryption feature
existed. (For more information about features that affect file
accessibility with products in the Windows Server 2003 family,
see "NTFS" later in this text file.)

   IMPORTANT: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT
   and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and you want to
   have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate version of Windows NT
   is version 4.0 with the latest released Service Pack. Using the
   latest Service Pack maximizes compatibility between Windows NT 4.0
   and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. (Specifically,
   you must have Service Pack 5 or later.) Even the latest Service
   Pack, however, does not provide access to files using the new
   features in NTFS.

Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows NT is not
recommended. On these computers, a FAT partition containing the
Windows NT 4.0 operating system ensures that when started with
Windows NT 4.0, the computer will have access to needed files.
In addition, if Windows NT is not installed on the system partition,
which is almost always the first partition on the disk, it is
recommended that the system partition also be formatted with FAT.


------------------------------------------------------------
8.4   Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
      Server 2003, Enterprise Edition
------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to set up a computer so that it contains Windows NT 4.0
and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, first review the
following precautions:

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer.
     With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have
     other options for system recovery. For example, if you have
     a problem with a newly installed device driver, you can use
     Safe Mode, in which Windows Server 2003, Enterprise
     Edition, restarts with default settings and the minimum number
     of drivers. For more information about Safe Mode and other
     options for system recovery, see Help and Support Center.

   * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains
     both Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and
     Windows NT is not recommended. Follow the guidelines in "Multiple
     Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in
     this text file.

   * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
     released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text
     file.

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Do not install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on
     a compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the
     NTFS file system compression feature.

   * Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, could
     be overwritten.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation.


---------------------------------------------------------------
8.5   Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you set up a server so that it contains some combination of
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, with Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, or contains multiple partitions with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use the Encrypting
File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain steps. These
steps make encrypted files readable between the
different installations.

   * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
     same domain and that the user of these installations has a
     roaming profile.

   * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
     certificate and associated private key from one installation
     and import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing
and exporting certificates, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   CHOOSING A FILE SYSTEM FOR THE INSTALLATION PARTITION
======================================================================


You can choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations.

   Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory
   and domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your
   file system.

   IMPORTANT: On GPT disks, which are available only on Itanium
   architecture-based computers, it is strongly recommended that you
   use NTFS for the installation partition. However, if you have an
   Itanium architecture-based computer and you see that it has a small
   FAT partition of 100 MB or more, do not delete or reformat this
   partition. The partition is required for the loading of the
   operating system. For more information, see "Starting Setup on an
   Itanium Architecture-based Computer" in EntSrv4.TXT.

The following table lists a number of installation scenarios
for x86-based computers (the last two scenarios are fairly uncommon)
and provides file system guidelines for each one:

The sections that follow provide information about reformatting or
converting a FAT or FAT32 partition to use NTFS, as well as additional
background information about NTFS, FAT, and FAT32.


--------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS
--------------------------------------------------------
If you have a FAT or FAT32 partition on which you want to install a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use
NTFS instead, you have two choices:

   * You can convert the FAT or FAT32 partition to NTFS. This leaves
     files intact, although the partition may have somewhat more
     fragmentation and slower performance than a partition formatted
     with NTFS. However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS,
     regardless of whether the partition was formatted with NTFS
     or converted.

   * If you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on a FAT or FAT32 partition, you are offered the option to
     convert the partition to NTFS. You can also convert a FAT or
     FAT32 partition after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
     information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click
     Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command
     window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

   * You can reformat the partition with NTFS. This erases all files
     on the partition, but results in less fragmentation and better
     performance than with a converted partition.

      IMPORTANT: If you have an Itanium architecture-based computer
      and you see that it has a small FAT partition of 100 MB or more,
      do not delete or reformat this partition. The partition is
      required for the loading of the operating system. For more
      information, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
      Architecture-based Computer" in EntSrv4.TXT.

If you format a partition during Setup, the file systems choices are
listed as NTFS and FAT. The following table provides information about
the relationship between partition size and file system choices during
Setup.

                                continues to support

                                of this size.


If you format a partition during Setup, you can choose between a quick
format and a full format:

Quick format

Quick format creates the file system structure on the disk without
verifying the integrity of every sector. Choose this method for any
disk that has no bad sectors and no history of file-corruption
problems that might be related to bad sectors.

Full format

A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors so that they are not
used for storing data. Choose this method for any disk that has bad
sectors or has a history of file-corruption problems that might be
related to bad sectors.


------------------------------------
9.2   NTFS Compared to FAT and FAT32
------------------------------------
NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family
include a new version of NTFS, with support for a variety of features
including Active Directory, which is needed for domains, user
accounts, and other important security features. For more details
about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text file.

FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except that FAT32 is
designed for larger disks than FAT. The file system that works most
easily with large disks is NTFS.

The following table describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems.

   Note: File system choices have no effect on access to files across
   the network. For example, using NTFS on all partitions on a server
   does not affect clients connecting across a network to shared
   folders or shared files on that server, even if those clients run
   an earlier operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows NT.

----------
9.3   NTFS
----------
This section provides background information about the features
available with NTFS. Some of these features include:

   * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or
     volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and
     as volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS
     does not degrade as it does with FAT.

   * Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active
     Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control
     network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune
     security options while keeping administration simple. Domain
     controllers and Active Directory require NTFS.

   * Compression features, including the ability to compress or
     uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However,
     a file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same
     time.)

   * File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
     folders.

   * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space
     by making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This
     feature is not included with Windows Server 2003,
     Web Edition, or with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.)

   * Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to
     restore information quickly in the event of power failure or
     other system problems.

   * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
     in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
     NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
     are written to.

   * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
     of disk space used by individual users.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in the
Windows Server 2003 family.

For information about converting or reformatting a FAT or FAT32
partition, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS"
earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
10.0   PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both
of the following conditions are true:

   * You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade.

   * The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a
     dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before
     Windows 2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are
     disks that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using
     Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk,
     you cannot change the volume or partition sizes on the disk
     during Setup, and therefore no planning is needed regarding
     partition sizes. Instead, review the guidelines in "Working
     with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text file.

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: 
and D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three
primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition
can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition
cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

Do not install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a
compressed drive unless the partition was compressed with the NTFS
file system compression feature. (Uncompress a DriveSpace or
DoubleSpace drive before running Setup on it.)

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, require
approximately 1.25 GB to 2 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4
GB on an Itanium architecture-based computer, as described in "System
Requirements" in EntSrv1.TXT. It is recommended that you allow
considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. It is not
unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB on the partition, or more for
large installations. This allows space for a variety of items,
including optional components, user accounts, Active Directory
information, logs, future service packs, the paging file used by the
operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. After
installation is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new
and existing disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions
from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting
existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a
basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic. (If
you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that contains more than
one operating system, be sure to read "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
file.)

On Itanium architecture-based computers with more than one disk, you
can plan not only the sizes of partitions, but also the partition
style for each disk. A partition style determines the way that
information about the partition is stored. There are two partition
styles. The newer style (used on Itanium architecture-based computers
only) stores partition information in the globally unique identifier
(GUID) partition table (GPT). The older style stores information in
the master boot record (MBR). On Itanium architecture-based computers,
you must install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on a
GPT disk. With GPT, you can create more partitions and larger volumes,
and take advantage of other benefits. For more information about
partition styles on Itanium architecture-based computers, see
Help and Support Center, and the Windows Server 2003
Resource Kit, "Server Management Guide." 

   IMPORTANT: If you are setting up a computer so that it contains
   multiple operating systems, you must install Windows
   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on its own partition or logical
   drive. This ensures that Windows Server 2003,
   Enterprise Edition, will not overwrite crucial files that are
   needed by the other operating system. For more information, see
   "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
   System" earlier in this text file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a
separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is
necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for
the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.

If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation
Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned
disk space so that you can create it (at least 4 GB of space is
recommended). As an alternative, for the system disk (not cluster
disks), you can plan to make the disk a dynamic disk, which allows
more flexibility in the use of the disk space than a basic disk.
(However, if you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that
contains more than one operating system, see "Deciding Whether a
Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this
text file.)

For more information about Remote Installation Services and about
disk and partition choices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


---------------------------------------
10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
---------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned
     disk space, you can create the partition for your Windows
     Server 2003 family product by using the unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family on that partition, with or without reformatting the
     partition first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on
     the partition. If you do not reformat the partition, but you
     do install a Windows Server 2003 family product where
     there is already an operating system, that operating system
     will be overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications
     you want to use with the Windows Server 2003
     family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     Windows Server 2003 family product. Deleting an existing
     partition also erases any data on that partition.


-------------------------------------------
10.3   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
-------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform
a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.
    
      CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
      disk to basic, so back it up first.

You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you can
use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server 2003
family. To use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, follow the instructions in
Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find
the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then
delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted
to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only
unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic
disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and
     the computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family. For more information, see topics about
     dynamic disks and the partition table in Help and Support Center.
     To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
     Start, and then click Help and Support.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
10.4   Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets
       with Parity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, you
must prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with
Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets, or Stripe Sets with Parity"
in EntSrv2.TXT.


======================================================================
11.0   NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================


TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


-------------------
11.1   IP Addresses
-------------------
Using TCP/IP requires that an IP address be provided for each
computer. This section describes IP addressing options. There are two
basic approaches for providing an IP address for a server you are
installing:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in EntSrv4.TXT.

Static IP addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.


---------------------------------
11.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
---------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with 
easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the
numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the
TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller
(or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server,
which makes it a domain controller), unless the software
for Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, detects that a DNS
server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by
choosing the DNS server role in Manage Your Server or by using
Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs
in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution.

WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any earlier
Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You might
also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. You
can install WINS after Setup by choosing the WINS server role in
Manage Your Server or by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is
part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server.


======================================================================
12.0   DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================


A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

For more information about Active Directory, see Help and
Support Center (after completing Setup, click Start, and then click
Help and Support).

                    Setup Text Files, Part 2 of 4:
                          Running Setup and
                     Upgrading on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************
         

This part of the text file series provides recommendations for
preparing your system for a new installation or an upgrade, and it
explains how to run Setup for Microsoft Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

Later sections in this text file provide information about upgrading
a server cluster to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. With
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering
to ensure that users have constant access to important server-based
resources. With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that
appear to users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster
fails, another node begins to provide service (a process known as
failover). Mission-critical applications and resources remain
continuously available.

For more information about the deployment of servers, see the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The following list of headings can help you find the information that
applies to you. For information about planning an upgrade or a new
installation, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about performing a new
installation on server cluster nodes, see Datactr4.TXT.

1.0   PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE RUNNING SETUP
======================================================================


This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server before running Setup.

If you are installing Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
on server cluster nodes, be sure to read Datactr4.TXT.

----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.

----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you run Setup, it is recommended that you back up your current
files, unless the computer has no files or the current operating
system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a variety of
different media, such as a tape drive or the hard disk of another
computer on the network.

-------------------------------
1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.


======================================================================
2.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN X86-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
x86-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an
Itanium architecture-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
Architecture-based Computer" later in this text file.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting.

For important information to help you make the initial choices
offered by Setup, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about unattended
Setup and other options available when you start Setup, see "Planning
for Unattended Setup" later in this text file.

---------------------------------------------------
2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
-------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by
checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the
Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy
disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line
at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts
will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can
gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message
saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete
list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file,
restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.

2.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
x86-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup for an
upgrade, see "Starting Setup for an Upgrade" later in this text file.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium
architecture-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
Architecture-based Computer" later in this text file.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.

2.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
--------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures.

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running
   Microsoft Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk
   caching. Otherwise, the Setup process (started from Winnt.exe)
   could take a long time. To enable disk caching on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can use SMARTDrive. For
   information about SMARTDrive, see the documentation for
   Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.
 
   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD ON AN X86-BASED
   COMPUTER

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD-ROM drive. This method applies only if you want to perform a
new installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform
an installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive and whether you want to
      perform a new installation (not an upgrade). Continue only if
      both are true.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.

2.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, from a
network, you either share the files directly from the CD or copy them
to a shared folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to
run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, DATACENTER EDITION, FROM A
   NETWORK (X86-BASED COMPUTERS ONLY)

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows Server
      2003, Datacenter Edition, connect to the shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
        Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or
        later, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.

======================================================================
3.0   STARTING SETUP FOR AN UPGRADE
======================================================================


If you are upgrading to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can start Setup from the CD or from a network.

For information about providing a mass storage driver or a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file during Setup, see "Providing a Mass
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.

IMPORTANT: To run Setup for an upgrade, you must be a member of the
Administrators group on the local computer. If the computer is joined
to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to
perform this procedure. As a security best practice, if you start
Setup from a computer running Windows 2000, consider using Run as.

Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands
or programs using a different security context. For example, you can
log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running
Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
search for "runas."

>>>TO START AN UPGRADE FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to display a
      dialog box.

   2. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>> TO START AN UPGRADE FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files by either
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
      the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, connect to the shared
      folder or drive that contains the Setup files.

   3. Run Setup.exe.
 
   4. Follow the Setup instructions.


======================================================================
4.0   STARTING SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER
======================================================================


This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an
Itanium architecture-based computer. For an explanation of how
to start Setup on an x86-based computer, see "Starting Setup on
an x86-based Computer" earlier in this text file.

In computers with the Itanium processor or the Itanium 2 processor,
the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is the interface between a
computer's firmware, hardware, and operating system. The EFI defines a
new disk partition style called a GUID partition table (GPT), which is
available only for Itanium architecture-based computers. The
installation partition on an Itanium architecture-based computer must
be on a GPT disk. Setup automatically specifies GPT for the disk used
for installation. You can still read and write to master boot record
(MBR) volumes, which are common to most PCs, but you cannot install
on one.

You cannot access GPT disks locally from an x86-based computer. If
you want to move a disk from an Itanium architecture-based computer to
an x86-based computer, use an MBR disk. This is true regardless of
whether the disk is basic or dynamic.

Before installing, verify that you are using the correct version of
the firmware. For more information, refer to the hardware
manufacturer's documentation.

   IMPORTANT: Itanium architecture-based computers require a
   minimum 100-MB FAT partition for the operation of the EFI. This
   EFI system partition is created automatically during Setup, and it
   stores programs and information files that the EFI uses to start
   the operating system. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

Setup also creates a Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR), which is
required by the operating system. The size of this partition depends
on the size of the hard disk. On drives less than 16 GB in size, the
MSR is 32 MB. On drives greater than or equal to 16 GB, the MSR is
128 MB. Do not delete or reformat this partition.

>>>TO START SETUP ON AN ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE-BASED COMPUTER

   1. Immediately after turning on the computer, insert the Setup CD
      in the CD-ROM drive.

   2. When the EFI Boot Manager menu appears, select the CD-ROM
      option.

   3. When prompted, press any key to start from the CD-ROM.
 
   4. Follow the on-screen Setup instructions.


======================================================================
5.0   PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================


This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can
view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows
     2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family, use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With
     Windows NT 4.0, before starting unattended Setup, apply Service
     Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD
     for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, in the CD-ROM
     drive and open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM
     drive, change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT,
     Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family, insert the Setup CD for Windows
     Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, in the CD-ROM drive, and open
     the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change to
     the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the command
     options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition;
     the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003,
     Enterprise Edition; or the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD
     for the 64-bit version of the product in the CD-ROM drive and
     open the command prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type
     cmd). Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64
     directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see Datactr1.TXT for
important background information about issues such as partitions, file
system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name resolution.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass
   Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.

If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer,
see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this text file.


Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
Edition, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or specify a
partition on which you want to install. You can create a partition
from the available unpartitioned space, specify an existing partition,
or delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk
space for the new installation. If you specify any action that will
cause information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm
your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for
New Installations" in Datactr1.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased.

Performing a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on a partition that contains another operating
system overwrites the existing operating system.


Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, to use
multiple languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking
Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify regional and language options by
clicking Regional and Language Options in Control Panel.


Choosing a Licensing Mode
-------------------------
Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see Datactr1.TXT. If you are unsure which mode to use,
select "Per Server," because you can change once from "Per Server"
mode to "Per Device or Per User" mode at no cost.


Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in Datactr1.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."


Setting the Administrator Account Password
-------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep
   a strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help
   and Support.


Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.


Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and
Setup, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" in
Datactr1.TXT. For additional information about TCP/IP configuration,
see Help and Support Center as well as the Windows Deployment and
Resource Kits for the Windows Server 2003 family. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on
     your network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP
     provides an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your
     network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option called
     Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using
     APIPA, complete the network configuration after Setup, because
     a server using APIPA can communicate only with other computers
     using APIPA on the same network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of
     APIPA, see "IP Addresses" in Datactr1.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS AND WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).
  
   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the
      address of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.


Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
in Datactr1.TXT.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.


Choosing Server Components
--------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.


======================================================================
6.0   PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE WINDOWS
      SERVER 2003 FAMILY
======================================================================


After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:


Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.


How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.


Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number
     (toll-free, wherever possible) is displayed on your screen. When
     you call the number, a customer service representative asks for
     the Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The
     customer service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.


Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.


---------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.

7.0   PREPARING FOR UPGRADING CLUSTERING
======================================================================


The following sections provide information on the initial steps
needed for upgrading clustering:

   * Understanding the basic preparations needed.

   * Confirming your hardware compatibility with Windows
     Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   * Choosing from the available options for upgrading.


----------------------------------
7.1   Other Sources of Information
----------------------------------
Following are sources of additional information on server clusters
and other topics related to high availability:

   * For more information on server clusters, you can view Help and
     Support Center topics for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
     Edition, on the Web. One way to view this information is to
     work from any computer that has Internet access (regardless
     of the operating system running on that computer). You can view
     Help and Support Center topics at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

     Another way to view this information is to open Help and Support
     Center. To do this, go to a computer running Windows
     Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, click Start, and then click Help
     and Support.

   * For more information about deployment and management of servers
     and server clusters, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits
     on the Web at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

   * For information about backup and recovery planning, change
     management, configuration management, and other concepts
     related to operational best practices, see resources in the
     Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). To see
     a description of ITIL, go to:

        http://www.itil.co.uk/

        Note: Web addresses can change, so you might be unable to
        connect to the Web site mentioned here.


----------------------------
7.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
Ensure that your entire cluster solution (including your drivers as
well as your hardware) is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


--------------------------------------
7.3   Options for Upgrading Clustering
--------------------------------------
You have several options when upgrading clustering. You can:

   * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000,
     possibly through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see
     "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition," later in this
     text file.

   * Perform a new installation of Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, and install the Cluster service at the same
     time. For more information about this option, see "Installing
     on Cluster Nodes" in Datactr4.TXT.


--------------------------------------------
7.4   Quorum Resource Options for an Upgrade
--------------------------------------------
With clusters running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource (the
resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run). These options are:

   * Single node server cluster

   * Single quorum device server cluster 

   * Majority node set

Before upgrading, refer to "Quorum Resource Options" in Datactr4.TXT
to learn more about these options.


======================================================================
8.0   UPGRADING A CLUSTER FROM WINDOWS 2000 TO
      WINDOWS SERVER 2003, DATACENTER EDITION
======================================================================


If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on cluster nodes, you might be able to perform a
rolling upgrade of the operating system. In a rolling upgrade, you
sequentially upgrade the operating system on each node, making sure
that one node is always available to handle client requests. When you
upgrade the operating system, the Cluster service is automatically
upgraded also. A rolling upgrade maximizes availability of clustered
services and minimizes administrative complexity. For more
information, see the next section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade, and
understand the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your
clustered resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
in Datactr3.TXT. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster
nodes if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to
Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" in Datactr3.TXT.


-------------------------------
8.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
-------------------------------
This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the sections that follow this section.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which a fewer number
of nodes handle the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not
have to recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains
intact during the upgrade process.

The four phases of a rolling upgrade are described in the
following section.


8.1.1  Phases of a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------
A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2:

Phase 1: Preliminary
--------------------
Each node runs Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with the following
hardware and software:

   * A cluster storage unit using Fibre Channel, not SCSI. Fibre
     Channel is the only type of cluster storage on the list of
     compatible hardware for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
     Edition. (Note that SCSI can be used for a two node cluster
     with Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, not
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.)

   * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
     Windows 2000 Datacenter Server).

   * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more
     information, see the application documentation, and "Resource
     Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
-----------------------
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups
while you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

You are now running a mixed-version cluster. A mixed-version cluster
is a cluster in which the nodes are running different versions of the
operating system. Although mixed-version clusters are supported by
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, they are not the optimal
configuration. It is recommended that you upgrade all nodes to the
same operating system by completing the final two phases of the
rolling upgrade.

When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2
-----------------------
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final
--------------
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to add nodes to the cluster, add them after
   completing the rolling upgrade. Before adding additional nodes,
   ensure that your entire cluster solution is compatible with
   products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).


8.1.2  Performing a Rolling Upgrade
-----------------------------------
For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section "How Rolling Upgrades Work." To perform the following
procedure, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the
local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate
authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the
Domain Admins group might be able to perform this procedure. As a
security best practice, consider using Run as to perform this
procedure. Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to
start commands or programs using a different security context. For
example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and, without
logging off, run a command as a member of the Administrators group. To
find more information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server
running Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab
and then search for "runas."

   IMPORTANT: For information about what resources are supported
   during rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   and "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

>>>TO PERFORM A ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000 and use
      resources that are supported during a rolling upgrade, as
      described in "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource
      Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" in Datactr3.TXT.

   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible
      with Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   3. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to
      upgrade first.

   4. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

   5. In the right pane, click Active Groups.

   6. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu,
      click Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

      The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
      moved and restarted on another node. After the groups are moved,
      one node is idle, and the other nodes handle all
      client requests.

   7. Use Setup for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, to
      upgrade the paused node from Windows 2000. (For information
      about running Setup, see the sections on starting Setup, earlier
      in this text file.)

      Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused
      node and automatically installs clustering for
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. The node
      automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of the upgrade
      process, but is still paused and does not handle any
      cluster-related work.

         Note: As you begin the setup process, you will receive a
         warning message about using the tempdrive option for Setup.
         Provided you have followed the preceding steps, you can click
         OK and proceed with Setup without using this option.

   8. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
      perform validation tests such as confirming that the operating
      system recognizes your network connections and, using Device
      Manager, ensuring that the operating system recognizes all of
      your storage devices.

   9. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and
      then on the File menu click Resume Node.

         Note: When you use Cluster Administrator for the first time
         on the upgraded node, Cluster Administrator will prompt you
         to "Open connection to cluster." In the "Cluster or server
         name" field, type a period (.). This will connect you to the
         cluster on the local upgraded node. Although you can connect
         to the cluster by typing the cluster name, if you do so you
         will be connected to the cluster on the Windows 2000 node and
         then will be required to respond to several warning messages.
 
  10. Repeat the preceding steps for the remaining nodes.

1.0   UPGRADES COMPARED TO NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation.
Upgrading is replacing Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Installing, in contrast
with upgrading, means completely removing the previous operating
system, or installing a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
on a disk or disk partition with no previous operating system.

The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between
an upgrade and a new installation:

Points to consider for an upgrade:
----------------------------------

   * With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing
     users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained.

   * With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and
     applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk,
     however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before
     beginning an upgrade.

   * If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as
     before, be sure to review applications information in
     Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD). Also, for the
     most recent information on compatible applications for products
     in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Points to consider for a new installation:
------------------------------------------
   * If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new
     installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve
     (compared to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you
     the opportunity to modify the size or number of disk
     partitions, to make them match your requirements more closely.

   * If you want to practice careful configuration management, for
     example, for a server where high availability is important,
     you might want to perform a new installation on that server
     instead of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on
     which the operating system has been upgraded several times in
     the past.


------------------
1.1   Upgrade Path
------------------
If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, into the same folder as the currently
installed copy of Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. The only operating
system from which you can upgrade to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, is Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.


======================================================================
2.0   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
======================================================================
Before upgrading or installing your server, make sure that you have
chosen hardware that supports Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition.


-------------------------
2.1   System Requirements
-------------------------
Computers that run Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, must
be on the compatibility list for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
Edition. For details, see the hardware compatibility information in
the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

The requirements for systems on the compatibility list for
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, include the following:

   * For an x86-based computer:

      * Eight or more processors with a minimum speed of 550
        megahertz (MHz). For computers on which you are upgrading
        from Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, the minimum processor
        speed is 400 MHz. A maximum of 32 processors per computer
        is supported.

      * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum, 64 gigabytes (GB) maximum.

   * For an Itanium architecture-based computer:

      * Eight or more processors with a minimum speed of 733 MHz. A
        maximum of 64 processors per computer is supported.

      * 1 GB of RAM minimum, 512 GB maximum.

   * A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to
     accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have
     flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is
     recommended that you allow considerably more space than the
     minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately
     2 GB to 4 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4 GB on an
     Itanium architecture-based computer. The larger amount of space
     is required if you are running Setup across a network instead
     of from a CD-ROM.

        Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described
        in the previous paragraph. After Setup is finished, actual
        hard disk space used for the operating system will be more
        than the free space required for Setup, because of space
        needed for the paging file, for any optional components you
        install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and
        other Active Directory information. The usual size for the
        paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information
        about the paging file, optional components, user accounts, and
        information stored in Active Directory, see Help and Support
        Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
        Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

   * VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher
     recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other
     pointing device.

     As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard,
     you can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor that
     is designed for products in the Windows Server 2003
     family. For details, see the hardware compatibility information
     in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For CD-ROM installation:

   * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

   * One or more network adapters and related cables that are
     designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family.
     For details, see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.


----------------------------
2.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
When you purchase a server running Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, you are purchasing a system that has been
extensively tested for compatibility between the hardware components,
the drivers, and the operating system. For more information about
hardware compatibility, contact your hardware manufacturer, and see
the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


2.2.1  Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which
you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain
the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files.
Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that
update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built
into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be
replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file)
and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the
time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use
Dynamic Update when running Setup.

Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and
easy to use:

   * The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update
     Web site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files
     that are important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made
     available through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that
     will not significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic
     Update.

   * Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are
     required for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly
     examines your computer hardware. No personal information is
     collected, and no information is saved. The only purpose is
     to select appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration.
     This keeps the download as short as possible and ensures that
     only necessary drivers are downloaded to your hard disk.

   * You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation
     compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup
     itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for
     running Setup.

   * You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for
     this requires several steps. For a brief description of
     unattended Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
     in Datactr2.TXT. For details about how to use Dynamic Update
     with unattended Setup (also called automated installation),
     see "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the
     Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
     Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:
      
        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can
use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to:

   http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/


======================================================================
3.0   IMPORTANT FILES TO REVIEW
======================================================================


At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup,
familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found in the \Docs
folder on the CD for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

This file contains important usage information about topics such as
application compatibility, hardware, or networking. Also familiarize
yourself with information about hardware compatibility for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family.

For the most recent information on compatible applications for
products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================


This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

   Note: On an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can install
   Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of Windows
   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or the 64-bit version of
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. In the sections that
   follow, information about operating systems that you cannot install
   does not apply. For example, information about Windows 2000 or
   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not apply to an Itanium
   architecture-based computer.

What licensing mode to use
--------------------------
With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you can choose
between two licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User
   * Per Server

Per Device or Per User mode requires a separate Client Access
License (CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server
running a product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Per
Server mode requires a separate CAL for each concurrent
connection to a server. For more information about licensing,
see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file.


What file system to use on the installation partition
-----------------------------------------------------
You can potentially choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that
supports Active Directory, which includes many important features
such as domains and domain-based security.


What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing
partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system.
Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters
(for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" later in this text file.


How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
later in this text file.


Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file.


======================================================================
5.0   CHOOSING A LICENSING MODE
======================================================================


Products in the Windows Server 2003 family support two licensing
modes:

  * Per Device or Per User
  * Per Server

If you choose the "Per Device or Per User" mode, each device or user
that accesses a server running a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL).
With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of
servers running products in the Windows Server 2003 family. This
is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more
than one server running products in the Windows Server 2003
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words,
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with
five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at
any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five
clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not
need any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access
servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network
clients for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server, because you
can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at
no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can
display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support). If you use Terminal Server,
be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.


======================================================================
6.0   CHOOSING A FILE SYSTEM FOR THE INSTALLATION PARTITION
======================================================================


You can choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations.

   Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory
   and domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your
   file system.

   IMPORTANT: On GPT disks, which are available only on Itanium
   architecture-based computers, it is strongly recommended that you
   use NTFS for the installation partition. However, if you have an
   Itanium architecture-based computer and you see that it has a small
   FAT partition of 100 MB or more, do not delete or reformat this
   partition. The partition is required for the loading of the
   operating system. For more information, see "Starting Setup on an
   Itanium Architecture-based Computer" in Datactr2.TXT.

The sections that follow provide information about reformatting or
converting a FAT or FAT32 partition to use NTFS, as well as additional
background information about NTFS, FAT, and FAT32.


--------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS
--------------------------------------------------------
If you have a FAT or FAT32 partition on which you want to install a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use
NTFS instead, you have two choices:

   * You can convert the FAT or FAT32 partition to NTFS. This leaves
     files intact, although the partition may have somewhat more
     fragmentation and slower performance than a partition formatted
     with NTFS. However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS,
     regardless of whether the partition was formatted with NTFS
     or converted.

     If you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on a FAT or FAT32 partition, you are offered the option to
     convert the partition to NTFS. You can also convert a FAT or
     FAT32 partition after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
     information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click
     Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command
     window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

   * You can reformat the partition with NTFS. This erases all files
     on the partition, but results in less fragmentation and better
     performance than with a converted partition.

        IMPORTANT: If you have an Itanium architecture-based computer
        and you see that it has a small FAT partition of 100 MB or
        more, do not delete or reformat this partition. The partition
        is required for the loading of the operating system. For more
        information, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
        Architecture-based Computer" in Datactr2.TXT.

If you format a partition during Setup, the file systems choices are
listed as NTFS and FAT. The following table provides information about
the relationship between partition size and file system choices during
Setup.

======================================================================

created with Microsoft Windows   for a product in the Windows
95, Windows 98, or Windows       Server 2003 family, would have to
Millennium Edition.)             use NTFS. In other words, the
                                 Windows Server 2003 family
                                 continues to support
                                 previously-formatted FAT32 partitions
                                 of this size.


If you format a partition during Setup, you can choose between a quick
format and a full format:

Quick format
Quick format creates the file system structure on the disk without
verifying the integrity of every sector. Choose this method for any
disk that has no bad sectors and no history of file-corruption
problems that might be related to bad sectors.

Full format
A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors so that they are not
used for storing data. Choose this method for any disk that has bad
sectors or has a history of file-corruption problems that might be
related to bad sectors.


------------------------------------
6.2   NTFS Compared to FAT and FAT32
------------------------------------
NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family
include a new version of NTFS, with support for a variety of features
including Active Directory, which is needed for domains, user
accounts, and other important security features. For more details
about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text file.

FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except that FAT32 is
designed for larger disks than FAT. The file system that works most
easily with large disks is NTFS.

The following table compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.


======================================================================

   Note: On Itanium architecture-based computers with multiple disks,
   your choices include not only file systems but also partition
   style. For more information about the two partition styles
   available on Itanium architecture-based computers, see "Planning
   Disk Partitions or Volumes for New Installations" later in this
   text file, as well as Help and Support Center, and the Microsoft
   Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit, "Server Management Guide."


----------
6.3   NTFS
----------
This section provides background information about the features
available with NTFS. Some of these features include:

   * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or
     volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and
     as volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS
     does not degrade as it does with FAT.

   * Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active
     Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control
     network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune
     security options while keeping administration simple. Domain
     controllers and Active Directory require NTFS.

   * Compression features, including the ability to compress or
     uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However,
     a file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same
     time.)

   * File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
     folders.

   * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space
     by making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This
     feature is not included with Windows Server 2003, Web
     Edition, or with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.)

   * Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to
     restore information quickly in the event of power failure or
     other system problems.

   * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
     in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
     NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
     are written to.

   * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
     of disk space used by individual users.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in the
Windows Server 2003 family.

For information about converting or reformatting a FAT or FAT32
partition, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS"
earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
7.0   PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both
of the following conditions are true:

  * You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade.

  * The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a
    dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before
    Windows 2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are
    disks that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using
    Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
    Server 2003 family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk,
    you cannot change the volume or partition sizes on the disk
    during Setup, and therefore no planning is needed regarding
    partition sizes. Instead, review the guidelines in "Working
    with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text file.

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: and
D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three
primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition
can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition
cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, require approximately 2
GB to 4 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4 GB on an Itanium
architecture-based computer, as described in "System Requirements"
earlier in this text file. It is recommended that you allow
considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. It is not
unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB on the partition, or more for
large installations. This allows space for a variety of items,
including optional components, user accounts, Active Directory
information, logs, future service packs, the paging file used by the
operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. After
installation is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new
and existing disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions
from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting
existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a
basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic.

On Itanium architecture-based computers with more than one disk, you
can plan not only the sizes of partitions, but also the partition
style for each disk. A partition style determines the way that
information about the partition is stored. There are two partition
styles. The newer style (used on Itanium architecture-based computers
only) stores partition information in the
globally unique identifier (GUID) partition table (GPT). The older
style stores information in the master boot record (MBR). On Itanium
architecture-based computers, you must install
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, on a GPT disk. With GPT,
you can create more partitions and larger volumes, and take advantage
of other benefits. For more information about partition styles on
Itanium architecture-based computers, see Help and Support Center,
and the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit, "Server Management
Guide."

7.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a
separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is
necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for
the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.

If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation
Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned
disk space so that you can create it (at least 4 GB of space is
recommended). As an alternative, for the system disk (not cluster
disks), you can plan to make the disk a dynamic disk, which allows
more flexibility in the use of the disk space than a basic disk.

For more information about Remote Installation Services and about
disk and partition choices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


--------------------------------------
7.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
--------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned
     disk space, you can create the partition for your Windows
     Server 2003 family product by using the unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family on that partition, with or without reformatting the
     partition first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on
     the partition. If you do not reformat the partition, but you
     do install a Windows Server 2003 family product where
     there is already an operating system, that operating system
     will be overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications
     you want to use with the Windows Server 2003
     family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     Windows Server 2003 family product. Deleting an existing
     partition also erases any data on that partition.


--------------------------------------------------------------
7.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Windows Server 2003
      Family Partitions
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of products in the Windows
Server 2003 family. If you want to set up a computer this way, note
the following:

   * It is not necessary to maintain multiple operating systems as a
     safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode,
     in which Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, restarts
     with default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For
     more information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation. Because a unique security
     identifier (SID) is used for each installation on a domain,
     the computer name for each installation must be unique, even
     for multiple installations on the same computer.

   * If you use the Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
     containing multiple installations of products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family, the encrypted files will not be
     readable between the different installations unless you take
     one of the following approaches. One approach is to ensure that
     all the installations are in the same domain and that the user
     of these installations has a roaming profile. Another approach
     is to export the user's file encryption certificate and
     associated private key from one installation and import it into
     the other installations. For more information about EFS,
     roaming user profiles, and importing and exporting
     certificates, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and
     Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
     click Help and Support.


------------------------------------------
7.4   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform
a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.

        CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
        disk to basic, so back it up first.

     You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you
     can use the Setup program for a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. To use Windows 2000 or
     Windows XP, follow the instructions in Help for your operating
     system. To use Setup for a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase,
     find the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and
     then delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will
     be prompted to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk
     will contain only unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to
     create a new (basic disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and
     the computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see topics
     about dynamic disks and the partition table in Help and Support
     Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup,
     click Start, and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
8.0   NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================


TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on
your servers.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections
provide more information.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


------------------
8.1   IP Addresses
------------------
As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP
addressing options. There are two basic approaches for providing an IP
address for a server you are installing:


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in Datactr2.TXT. After Setup, use
information in Help and Support Center (click Start and then click
Help and Support) to install the DHCP component and complete the
configuration of the DHCP server.


Static IP addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

After you have formed a plan for IP addressing, the next components
to consider are those for name resolution, which is the process of
mapping a computer name (something that users can recognize and
remember) to the appropriate IP address. The following sections
describe options for name resolution.


--------------------------------
8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
--------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with
easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the
numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the
TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).


DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller
(or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server,
which makes it a domain controller), unless the software
for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, detects that a DNS
server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by
using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution.


WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any
earlier Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You
might also need to install WINS if it is required by your
applications. You can install WINS after Setup by using Add/Remove
Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control
Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server.


======================================================================
9.0   DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================


A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


--------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
--------------------------------------------------------
With Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, servers in a domain can have one of two roles:
domain controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts
and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) It is possible to change the role of
a server back and forth from domain controller to member server
(or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete. However, it is
recommended that you plan your domain before running Setup and change
server roles (and server names) only when necessary.

For more information about domain controllers and other
Active Directory topics, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

     7.0    Preparing for Upgrading Clustering
     8.0    Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Windows
            Server 2003, Datacenter Edition
     8.1    How Rolling Upgrades Work

Sections in this text file about upgrading on cluster nodes:
------------------------------------------------------------
     Section 8 cont'd. from Datactr2.TXT:
     8.2    Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
     8.3    Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
     8.4    Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000


--------------------------------------
8.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
--------------------------------------
There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restriction is as follows:

   * You cannot mix x86-based and Itanium architecture-based
     computers within the same cluster. Therefore you cannot perform
     a rolling upgrade from an x86-based computer to an Itanium
     architecture-based computer.
     

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. The operation of a
mixed-version cluster is complicated if a resource type that you add
to the cluster is supported in one version of the operating system but
not the other. For example, the Cluster service in
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, supports the Generic
Script resource type. However, older versions of the Cluster service
do not support it.

A mixed-version cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node
running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, but not on a
node running Windows 2000. The Cluster service transparently sets the
possible owners of new resource types to prevent these resources from
failing over to a Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In
other words, when you view the possible owners of a new resource type,
a Windows 2000 node will not be in the list, and you will not be able
to add this node to the list. If you create such a resource during the
mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups
containing those resources will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node. 

In order for a mixed-version cluster to work, the different versions
of the software running on each node must be prepared to communicate
with one another. This requirement leads to several basic restrictions
on the rolling-upgrade process.

   * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the
     cluster manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
     information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
     later in this text file.

   * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
     cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
     system, do not change the settings of resources (for example,
     do not change the settings of a printer resource).

If the preceding restriction cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.


-----------------------------------------------
8.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
-----------------------------------------------
Although the Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes the resources that are supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from
Windows 2000" later in this text file.


======================================================================
RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DHCP               DHCP is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.

IIS                IIS 6.0 is not supported during a rolling upgrade.
                   When upgrading a cluster that contains an IIS
                   resource, you must follow the procedure
                   described in "Upgrades That Include an IIS
                   Resource" later in this text file.

IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.

Local Quorum       Supported during rolling upgrades.

MSDTC              Supported during rolling upgrades. However,
                   avoid creating or deleting the MSDTC resource
                   while you are operating as a mixed version
                   cluster. Instead create the MSDTC resource
                   before starting the upgrade on any node, or wait
                   until the upgrade is complete on all nodes. For
                   more information on mixed version clusters, see
                   "How Rolling Upgrades Work" in Datactr2.TXT and
                   "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in
                   this text file.

Message Queuing    Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported
(also known as     during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
MSMQ)              that includes Message Queuing, see "Upgrades
                   That Include Message Queuing Resources" later in
                   this text file.

Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.

NNTP Service       NNTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
                   You must remove any NNTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades

Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard port monitor ports. See the
                   following section, "Upgrades that Include a
                   Print Spooler Resource."

SMTP Service       SMTP Service Instance is not supported in
Instance           Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
                   You must remove any SMTP Service Instance
                   resources prior to upgrading.

Time Service       Time Service is not supported in Windows
                   Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. You must remove
                   any Time Service resources prior to upgrading.

WINS               WINS is not fully supported during rolling
                   upgrades. You must instead perform a "Last node
                   rolling upgrade" as described in "Alternatives
                   to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in
                   this text file.

When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that
you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as
adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make
changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a
mixed version state.


8.3.1  Upgrades That Include a Print Spooler Resource
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) of printers
on cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Port Monitor ports). For
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

   * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
     Print Spooler resource.

   * Avoid adding new printers while you are performing a rolling
     upgrade. If you do add a new printer, when you install the
     drivers for that printer, be sure to install both the driver
     for Windows 2000 and the driver for Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, on all nodes.

   * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
     check them. Printing preferences in Windows Server 2003,
     Datacenter Edition, will not necessarily correspond to document
     defaults for the same printer in Windows 2000. This can be
     affected by differences in the drivers for the two operating
     systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.


--------------------------------------------------------
8.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
--------------------------------------------------------
Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including:

   * Internet Information Services (IIS)

   * DHCP

   * WINS

Special procedures, described in the sections that follow, must be
used when performing an upgrade of a cluster that contains these
resources. In addition to the resource types listed previously, you
might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling
upgrades. Be sure to read Relnotes.htm in the \Docs folder of the
Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, as well as
the product documentation that comes with the application or resource.


8.4.1  Upgrades That Include an IIS Resource
--------------------------------------------
IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. To upgrade a
clustered IIS resource, you must replace the existing IIS resource
with a Generic Script Resource. You have two options to do this; you
can perform each of the steps as described in the following procedure,
or you can use a script that is supplied with
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, which automates many of
the steps. The instructions for using the script are described in the
second procedure.


Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade Procedures
------------------------------------------------------------
To perform any of the cluster upgrade procedures in this text file,
you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local
computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.
If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins
group might be able to perform these procedures. As a security best
practice, consider using Run as to perform the upgrade procedures. Run
as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or
programs using a different security context. For example, you can log
on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a
command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more
information in Windows 2000 about Run as, on a server running
Windows 2000, click Start, click Help, click the Search tab, and then
search for "runas."

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 WITHOUT USING THE PROVIDED SCRIPT ON A
   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the
      resources that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and
      clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the details
      pane, click the resource that you want to remove, then on the
      File menu, click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions
      on Rolling Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general
      information about Setup, see Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource on the
      cluster that you are upgrading, create a DTC resource for this
      cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Datacenter Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

   4. On the Windows 2000 node, note the dependencies of the IIS
      instance resource. Note resources that depend on the IIS
      resource and also note what resources IIS itself is
      dependent on.

   5. Take the group containing the IIS instance resource offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups folder. In
      the details pane, click the group containing the IIS resource,
      then on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   6. Remove any dependencies on the IIS instance resource by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder. For
      each resource that is dependent on the IIS instance resource, in
      the details pane, click the resource you want to modify, then on
      the File menu, click Properties. On the Dependencies tab, click
      Modify. Click the IIS resource in the Dependencies list and
      click the left arrow to move it to the Available resources list.

   7. Delete the IIS instance resource by using Cluster Administrator
      and clicking the Resource folder in the console tree. In the
      details pane, click the IIS instance resource, then on the File
      menu, click Delete.

   8. Move the group to a node that is running Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, and create a Generic Script
      resource by following the procedure documented in "Checklist:
      Creating a clustered IIS Web or FTP service." To find this
      procedure, click Start on an upgraded node (one of the nodes
      running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition), click
      Help and Support, and click Availability and Scalability. Click
      Windows Clustering, click Server Clusters, click Checklists:
      Creating Server Clusters, then click Checklist: Creating a
      clustered IIS Web or FTP service. You can also view this Help
      and Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

      As part of this step, recreate the dependencies of the Generic
      Script resource identical to those of the now deleted IIS
      resource. Make everything that was dependent on the IIS resource
      dependent instead on the Generic Script resource. Also make the
      Generic Script resource dependent on everything that IIS was
      dependent on.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type is
      not supported in Windows 2000.

   9. Start the W3SVC service on this node and set the W3SVC service
      to start automatically. For more information about the W3SVC,
      see the topic titled "Internet Information Services (IIS)
      security." To find this topic, click Start on the upgraded node,
      click Help and Support, and click Internet Services. Click
      Internet Information Services, then click Internet Information
      Services (IIS) security. You can also view this Help and
      Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

  10. Bring the group containing the new Generic Script resource
      online by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Groups
      folder. In the details pane, click the group containing the
      Generic Script resource, then on the File menu, click
      Bring Online.

  11. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

  12. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Once the upgrade is complete, start the W3SVC service
      on this node and set the W3SVC service to start automatically.
    
         Note: Although suitable for most situations, it is not
         necessary to upgrade all nodes but one in the first step.
         Depending on your availability needs and the number of nodes
         in your cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding
         steps by performing steps three through 11 after only one,
         two or three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one
         and three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring
         it online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.

>>>TO USE THE PROVIDED SCRIPT TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 ON A
   CLUSTER THAT INCLUDES AN IIS RESOURCE

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Upgrade all nodes except the node containing the IIS instance
      resource from Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition. You can perform either a rolling upgrade, or
      a nonrolling upgrade, whichever is appropriate for your
      installation. Prior to upgrading, be sure to remove the resources
      that are not supported by Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Do this by using Cluster Administrator and clicking the
      Resource folder in the console tree. In the details pane, click
      the resource that you want to remove, then on the File menu,
      click Delete. For more information, see "Restrictions on Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file. For general information
      about Setup, see Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT.

   3. If you do not already have a
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource on the
      cluster that you are upgrading, create a DTC resource for this
      cluster on an upgraded node.

         Note: To cluster IIS on Windows Server 2003,
         Datacenter Edition, you must have a DTC resource on that
         cluster as well.

   4. On an upgraded node, open a Command Prompt and navigate to the
      %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv directory.

   5. Type:

      iis_switch cluster_name [group_name]

      where

      * cluster_name

        is the name of a physical node in the cluster that has been
        upgraded or the name of a virtual server.

      * group_name

        is optional, because the script will, by default, upgrade all
        IIS web and FTP resources in the cluster. However, if you want
        to upgrade only one particular group, you can specify the name
        of that resource group.

           IMPORTANT: The resource group that includes the IIS
           resource must be on the Windows 2000 node when you run
           the script.

        The script includes a step that will bring the group with the
        newly created Generic Script resource online. However, the
        script will only bring the group online if all resources in
        the group were online before the script was run. If the group
        was only partially online or was offline prior to the script
        being run, the script will take the entire group offline and
        will not bring any resources back online after the upgrade.
  
        Once the script completes, the newly created resource might
        immediately fail. This is because the W3SVC service is
        disabled. You can correct this problem by completing the
        following step.

   6. Once the script completes, take the newly created Generic Script
      resource offline, then start the W3SVC service on the upgraded
      node and set the W3SVC to start automatically. For more
      information about the W3SVC, see the topic titled "Internet
      Information Services (IIS) security." To find this topic, click
      Start on the upgraded node, click Help and Support, and click
      Internet Services. Click Internet Information Services, then
      click Internet Information Services (IIS) security. You can also
      view this Help and Support Center topic on the Web at:

         http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

   7. Bring the Generic Script resource online. 
 
   8. Using IIS, start the Web site on the upgraded node.

   9. Upgrade the final node to Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
      Edition. Once the upgrade is complete, start the W3SVC service
      on this node and set the service to start automatically.

  10. If appropriate, add the final upgraded node to the Possible
      Owners list for the newly created Generic Script resource by
      using the Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource
      folder. In the details pane, click the Generic Script resource.
      On the File menu, click Properties. On the General tab, next to
      Possible owners, click Modify.

      Only upgraded nodes can be the owner of the Generic Script
      Resource created in this procedure because this resource type
      is not supported in Windows 2000.

         Notes: The script will not upgrade IIS resources that are in
         the cluster group. If you have IIS resources that are in the
         cluster group, you can instead use the procedure "To upgrade
         from Windows 2000 without using the provided script on a
         cluster that includes an IIS resource" earlier in this
         text file.

         The script sets the script path as
         %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\ by default. You can modify
         this path if necessary. 
  
         Although suitable for most situations, it is not necessary to
         upgrade all nodes but one in the first step. Depending on
         your availability needs and the number of nodes in your
         cluster, you can modify the sequence of the preceding steps
         by performing steps two through four after only one, two or
         three nodes are upgraded. After upgrading between one and
         three nodes, create the Generic Script resource and bring it
         online. Then upgrade the remaining nodes.
    
    
8.4.2  Upgrades That Include Message Queuing Resources
------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Message Queuing is not fully supported during a
rolling upgrade.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000 ON A CLUSTER THAT CONTAINS MESSAGE
   QUEUING RESOURCES

   1. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   2. Take all of the Message Queuing cluster resources offline by
      using Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resources folder.
      In the details pane, click each Message Queuing resource, then
      on the File menu, click Take Offline.

   3. For each Message Queuing resource, take the Network Name
      resource that depends on it offline also.

   4. Upgrade all of the nodes from Windows 2000 to Windows
      Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Prior to upgrading, be sure to
      remove the resources that are not supported by
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Do this by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource folder in the
      console tree. In the details pane, click the resource that you
      want to remove, then on the File menu, click Delete.

   5. Bring the Network Name resources back online. Ensure that the
      Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) resource is online,
      then bring the Message Queuing resources online.


8.4.3  Last Node Rolling Upgrades
---------------------------------
If you have other resources on your cluster such as DHCP and WINS
that are not fully supported during a rolling upgrade and are not
described by other technology specific procedures listed previously
(such as IIS), you can perform a "last node rolling upgrade."

Last node rolling upgrades are similar to standard rolling upgrades.
In a last node rolling upgrade, you upgrade all nodes except the node
that contains the unsupported resources. After all other nodes are
upgraded, you then upgrade the final node containing the
identified resources.

Last node rolling upgrades are a way to accommodate resources that
cannot fail over to an older operating system from a node running
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Be aware that these
resources can, however, fail over the other way, that is, from the
older operating system to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition.

For information about group membership requirements for the following
procedure, see "Group Membership Requirements for Cluster Upgrade
Procedures" earlier in this text file.

>>>TO PERFORM A LAST NODE ROLLING UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 2000

   1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

   2. Confirm that your hardware is designed for or is compatible with
      Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

   3. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported by Windows Server 2003,
      Datacenter Edition, and remove those resources. Do this by using
      Cluster Administrator and clicking the Resource folder in the
      console tree. In the details pane, click the resource that you
      want to remove, then on the File menu, click Delete.

   4. Again using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
      Upgrades" earlier in this text file, identify the resources in
      your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades and
      are not covered by other technology specific upgrade procedures
      described previously.

   5. Move all of the resources identified in the previous step to a
      single node by double-clicking the Groups folder in the Cluster
      Administrator console tree. Click the group that contains the
      resource and then in the File menu, click Move Group.

   6. Upgrade the operating system on each of the nodes that is not
      hosting the resources moved in the previous step. 

   7. Move all of the resources that you moved in the earlier steps
      from the node that has not been upgraded to one of the
      newly upgraded nodes.

   8. Once all of the resources have been moved, upgrade the final
      node. After you upgrade, close the Manage Your Server dialog
      box if it is displayed. 

         Note: It is not mandatory to move all of these resources to
         a single node and upgrade that node last. However, following
         the procedure as described will typically give you the
         highest availability of the resources that do not support
         rolling upgrades.

                    Setup Text Files, Part 4 of 4:
                     Installing on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************


This part of the text file series provides information about
installing on cluster nodes. With Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that users have
constant access to important server-based resources. With clustering,
you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one server.
If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to
provide service (a process known as failover). Critical applications
and resources remain continuously available.

For more information about the deployment of servers, see the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The following list of headings can help you find the information that
applies to you. For information about planning an upgrade or a new
installation, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about running Setup,

1.0   Installing on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================


For information about installing on cluster nodes, see the sections
that follow. These sections can help you learn about:

   * Sources of additional information

   * How to plan for a new cluster installation

   * Decisions that you need to make regarding your quorum resource
     (the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
     configuration data and that must always be available for the
     cluster to run)


-------------------------------------
1.1   Important Information to Review
-------------------------------------
To prepare for installing clustering:

   * Review Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT for general information
     about Setup.

   * As described in Datactr1.TXT, confirm that your hardware,
     including your cluster storage, is compatible with products in
     the Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * In addition, check with the manufacturer of your cluster storage
     hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need to use the
     hardware with Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

        IMPORTANT: You must ensure that hardware in your entire
        cluster solution is compatible with products in the
        Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
        "Cluster hardware and drivers" in the "Planning for Cluster
        Installation" section later in this text file.

1.3   Planning for Cluster Installation
---------------------------------------
Before carrying out cluster installation, you need to plan hardware
and network details.

   CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device, before creating
   a cluster, when you turn on the computer and start the operating
   system, it is very important that only one node has access to the
   cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted.
   To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but
   one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example, LUN
   masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster
   disks, before creating the cluster. Once the Cluster service is
   running properly on one node, the other nodes can be installed and
   configured simultaneously. Each node of your cluster must be
   running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

In your planning, review the following items:

Cluster hardware and drivers
----------------------------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family. Confirm that your
entire cluster solution is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).

Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
installing cluster hardware. Otherwise the cluster storage could
be corrupted.

To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

Network adapters on the cluster nodes
-------------------------------------
In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
adapter will carry. The following list provides details about the
types of communication that an adapter can carry:

   * Only node-to-node communication (private network). This implies
     that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry
     other communication.

     For node-to-node communication, you connect the network adapter
     to a private network that is used exclusively within the cluster.
     Note that if the private network uses a single hub or network
     switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential point of
     failure in your cluster.

     The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet but you can use
     virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
     nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
     must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
     appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective
     of the Windows operating system running on the nodes. To avoid
     single points of failure, use independent VLAN hardware for the
     different paths between the nodes.

     If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, it is
     a best practice for the adapters for those networks to use static
     IP addresses instead of DHCP.

   * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network). This
     implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
     carry other communication.

   * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
     network). When you have multiple network adapters per node, a
     network adapter that carries both kinds of communication can
     serve as a backup for other network adapters.

   * Communication unrelated to the cluster. If a clustered node also
     provides services unrelated to the cluster, and there are enough
     adapters in the cluster node, you might want to use one adapter
     for carrying communication unrelated to the cluster.

The nodes of a cluster must be connected by two or more local area
networks (LANs); at least two networks are required to prevent a
single point of failure. A server cluster whose nodes are connected by
only one network is not a supported configuration. The adapters,
cables, hubs, and switches for each network must fail independently.
This usually implies that the components of any two networks must be
physically independent.

At least two networks must be configured to handle "All
communications (mixed network)" or "Internal cluster communications
only (private network)."

The recommended configuration for two adapters is to use one adapter
for the private (node-to-node only) communication and the other
adapter for mixed communication (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster
communication). Do not use teaming network adapters on the
private network.

If you use fault tolerant network adapters, create multiple private
networks instead of a single fault-tolerant network.

Do not configure a default gateway or DNS or WINS server on the
private network adapters. Do not configure private network adapters to
use name resolution servers on the public network; otherwise a name
resolution server on the public network might map a name to an IP
address on the private network. If a client then received that IP
address from the name resolution server, it might fail to reach the
address because no route from the client to the private network
address exists.

Configure WINS and/or DNS servers on the public network adapters. If
Network Name resources are used on the public networks, set up the DNS
servers to support dynamic updates; otherwise the Network Name
resources may not fail over correctly. Also, configure a default
gateway on the public network adapters. If there are multiple public
networks in the cluster, configure a default gateway on only one
of these.

When you use either the New Server Cluster Wizard or the Add Nodes
Wizard to install clustering on a node that contains two network
adapters, by default the wizard configures both of the network
adapters for mixed network communications. As a best practice,
reconfigure one adapter for private network communications only. For
more information, see "Change how the cluster uses a network" in Help
and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start,
and then click Help and Support. You can also view Help and Support
Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Consider choosing a name for each connection that tells what it is
intended for. The name will make it easier to identify the connection
whenever you are configuring the server.

Manually configure the communication settings, such as Speed, Duplex
Mode, Flow Control and Media Type of each cluster network adapter. Do
not use automatic detection. You must configure all of the cluster
network adapters to use the same communication settings.

The adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different
subnet masks.

Do not use the same IP address for two network adapters, even if they
are connected to two different networks.

   Note: Confirm that your entire cluster solution is compatible with
   the products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For more
   information, see "Cluster hardware and drivers" earlier in this
   section. If you use a crossover cable to implement a private
   network, when the cluster is created on the first node the second
   node should be turned on but stopped in the BIOS or at the startup
   menu. In this state, the Media Sense feature of Windows might not
   recognize the network adapter as connected. If you continue
   creating the cluster, the crossover cable will be detected when
   you start the second node. The network will be established in the
   default mode, which is mixed. You can then change the network mode
   to private using Cluster Administrator.

Cluster IP address
------------------
Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
DHCP for this address.

IP addressing for cluster nodes
-------------------------------
Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the individual cluster
nodes. Each network adapter on each node requires IP addressing. It is
a best practice to assign each network adapter a static IP address. As
an alternative, you can provide IP addressing through DHCP. If you use
static IP addresses, set the addresses for each linked pair of network
adapters (linked node-to-node) to be on the same subnet.

Note that if you use DHCP for the individual cluster nodes, it can
act as a single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster
nodes so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses,
temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary unavailability
of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use DHCP, evaluate ways
to ensure availability of DHCP services, and consider the possibility
of using long leases for the cluster nodes. This helps to ensure that
they always have a valid IP address.

Cluster name
------------
Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is the
name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. (The
actual applications running on the cluster typically have different
network names.) The cluster name must be different from the domain
name, from all computer names on the domain, and from other cluster
names on the domain.

Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes
---------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
service
----------------------------------------------------------------
To install and configure the cluster service, you must be using an
account that is in the local Administrators group on each node. As you
install and configure each node, if you are not using an account in
the local Administrators group, you will be prompted to provide the
logon credentials for such an account.

Cluster service user account
----------------------------
Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the name
and password under which the Cluster service will run. You need to
supply this user name and password during cluster installation.

It is best if the Cluster service user account is an account not used
for any other purpose. If you have multiple clusters, set up a unique
Cluster service user account for each cluster. The account must be a
domain account; it cannot be a local account. However, do not make
this account a domain administrator account because it does not need
domain administrator user rights.

As part of the cluster setup process, the Cluster service user
account is added to the local Administrators group on each node. As
well as being a member of the local Administrators group, the Cluster
service user account requires an additional set of user rights:

   * Act as part of the operating system.
  
   * Back up files and directories.

   * Adjust memory quotas for a process.

   * Increase scheduling priority.

   * Log on as a service.

   * Restore files and directories.

These user rights are also granted to the Cluster service user
account as part of the cluster setup process. Be aware that the
Cluster service user account will continue to have these user rights
even after all nodes are evicted from the cluster. The risk that this
presents is mitigated by the fact that these user rights are not
granted domain wide, but rather only locally on each former node.
However, remove this account from each evicted node if it is no longer
needed.

Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the Cluster service
user account (follow your organization's policies for password
renewal).

Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint and
log files)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan on setting aside a volume on your cluster storage for holding
important cluster configuration information. This information makes up
the cluster quorum resource, which is needed when a cluster node stops
functioning. The quorum resource provides node-independent storage of
crucial data needed by the cluster. For important information on
quorum resource options, see "Quorum Resource Options" later in this
text file.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. It is
recommended that you do not store user data on any volume in the
quorum resource.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions
   formatted as NTFS (they can be either compressed or uncompressed).
   Partition and format all disks on the cluster storage device
   before adding the first node to your cluster. Do not configure
   them as dynamic disks, and do not use spanned volumes
   (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks. For the
   64-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
   cluster disks on the cluster storage device must be partitioned
   as MBR and not as GPT disks.


-----------------------------
1.4   Quorum Resource Options
-----------------------------
With server clusters on Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can now choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource
(the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run). The first is a single node server cluster, which has been
available in the past and continues to be supported. A single node
cluster is often used for development and testing and can be
configured with, or without, external cluster storage devices. For
single node clusters without an external cluster storage device, the
local disk is configured as the cluster quorum device.

The second option is a single quorum device server cluster, which has
also been available in earlier Windows versions. This model places the
cluster configuration data on a shared cluster storage device that all
nodes can access. This is the most common model and is recommended for
most situations. You might choose the single quorum device model if
all of your cluster nodes are in the same location and you want to
take advantage of the fact such a cluster continues supporting users
even if only one node is running.

The third option, which is new for Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, is a "majority node set." A majority node set is
a single quorum resource from a server cluster perspective; however,
the cluster configuration data is actually stored on multiple disks
across the cluster. The majority node set resource ensures that the
cluster configuration data is kept consistent across the different
disks. In the majority node set model, every node in the cluster uses
a directory on its own local system disk to store the cluster
configuration data. If the configuration of the cluster changes, that
change is reflected across the different disks. Be aware that it is
also possible to have shared storage devices in a majority node set
cluster. The exact configuration depends on the requirements for your
installation.

Only use a majority node set cluster in targeted scenarios, such as:

   * Geographically dispersed cluster: A cluster that spans
     multiple sites.

   * Eliminating single points of failure: Although when using a
     single cluster storage device the quorum disk itself can be made
     highly available via RAID, the controller port or the Host Bus
     Adapter (HBA) itself may be a single point of failure.

   * Clusters with no shared disks: There are some specialized
     configurations that need tightly consistent cluster features
     without having shared disks.

   * Clusters that host applications that can fail over, but where
     there is some other, application-specific way, to replicate or
     mirror data between nodes: For example, this model is useful if
     you use database log shipping for keeping a SQL database state up
     to date.

Do not configure your cluster as a majority node set cluster unless
it is part of a cluster solution offered by your Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM), Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or Independent
Hardware Vendor (IHV).


1.4.1  Cluster Model Considerations
-----------------------------------
Before implementing your cluster, consider what type of quorum
resource solution you plan to use. Take into consideration the
following differences between single quorum device clusters and
majority node set clusters.

   Note: The following information is presented to help you make
   basic decisions about the placement and management of your cluster
   nodes and quorum resource. It does not provide all the details
   about the requirements for each cluster model, or how each model
   handles failover situations. If you are not sure which model to
   use or where you want to place your cluster nodes, install
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster
   node, then consult the on-line help cluster documentation in Help
   and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
   Edition. See "Using a Majority Node Set" later in this text file
   for more information on how to access Help and Support Center.


Node failover behavior
----------------------
The failover behavior of the majority node set is significantly
different from the behavior of the single quorum device model:

   * Using the single quorum device model, you can maintain cluster
     availability with only a single operational node.

   * If you use a majority node set, more than half, or (Number of
     nodes configured in the cluster/2) + 1 nodes must be operational
     to maintain cluster availability. The following table shows the
     number of node failures that a given majority node set cluster
     can tolerate yet continue to operate:

   ===================================================================
   NUMBER OF NODES       NUMBER OF NODE            NUMBER OF NODES
   CONFIGURED IN THE     FAILURES ALLOWED          NEEDED TO CONTINUE
   CLUSTER               BEFORE CLUSTER FAILURE    CLUSTER OPERATIONS
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1                     0                         1
   2                     0                         2
   3                     1                         2
   4                     1                         3
   5                     2                         3
   6                     2                         4
   7                     3                         4
   8                     3                         5


Geographic considerations
-------------------------
You would commonly use a single quorum resource model if all nodes in
your cluster will be in the same geographical location. As part of
this requirement, your nodes must be connected to the same physical
storage device.

A majority node set on the other hand would typically be appropriate
if you have geographically dispersed nodes. The cluster configuration
data is stored locally on each node on a file share that is shared out
to the other nodes on the network. However, those shares must always
be accessible or nodes can fail.

There are other specific requirements for geographically dispersed
clusters, including the requirement that round-trip latency of the
network between cluster nodes be a maximum of 500 milliseconds. For
information on cluster solutions that meet all requirements for a
geographically dispersed cluster, refer to hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Hardware
--------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family of products. For
both cluster models, confirm that your system or hardware components,
including your cluster disks, are compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


1.4.2  Using a Majority Node Set
--------------------------------
This section tells how to obtain additional information about the
majority node set model. For a description of a majority node set,
see "Quorum Resource Options" earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: Before implementing a majority node set, it is highly
   recommended that you read the online clustering documentation in
   Help and Support Center to thoroughly understand all the
   considerations, requirements, and restrictions for each type of
   quorum resource solution.

======================================================================
2.0   Beginning the Cluster Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================


The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

   IMPORTANT: Carefully review your network cables after connecting
   them. Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example,
   private network connected to public).


2.1   Initial Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI When Using a
      Fibre Channel Shared Storage Device or No Shared Storage Device
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Turn on a single node. Leave all other nodes turned off.

   * During this initial installation phase, remain in the BIOS or
     Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration process, and
     do not allow the operating system to start. While viewing the
     BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that you can scan the
     bus and see the drives from the active cluster node. On a 32-bit
     computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer, use the EFI configuration screens.
     Consult the instructions from your manufacturer to determine
     whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically
     or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press
     specific keys to access them. Follow the manufacturer's
     instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI
     configuration process.


2.2   Final Steps to Complete the Installation
----------------------------------------------
If you have not already installed Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster node, install it before
proceeding. For information about decisions you must make, such as
decisions about licensing, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about
running Setup, see Datactr2.TXT.

After you complete the BIOS or EFI configuration, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and complete the configuration of the
Cluster service using Cluster Administrator.

With the Cluster Administrator New Server Cluster Wizard, you can
choose between Typical (full) configuration and Advanced (minimum)
configuration options. Typical configuration is appropriate for most
installations and results in a completely configured cluster. Use
the Advanced configuration option only for clusters that have complex
storage configurations that the New Server Cluster Wizard cannot
validate or for configurations in which you do not want the cluster
to manage all of the storage. The following examples describe
each situation:

   * In some complex storage solutions, such as a fiber channel
     switched fabric that contains several switches, a particular
     storage unit might have a different identity on each computer in
     the cluster. Although this is a valid storage configuration, it
     violates the storage validation heuristics in the New Server
     Cluster Wizard. If you have this type of storage solution, you
     might receive an error when you are trying to create a cluster
     using the Typical configuration option. If your storage
     configuration is set up correctly, you can disable the storage
     validation heuristics and avoid this error by restarting the New
     Server Cluster Wizard, selecting the Advanced configuration
     option instead.

   * On particular nodes in a cluster, you may want to have some disks
     that are to be clustered and some disks that are to be kept
     private. The Typical configuration option configures all disks as
     clustered disks and creates cluster resources for them all.
     However, with the Advanced configuration option, you can keep
     certain disks private because this configuration creates a
     cluster in which only the quorum disk is managed by the cluster
     (if you chose to use a physical disk as the quorum resource).
     After the cluster is created, you must then use Cluster
     Administrator to add any other disks that you want the cluster to
     manage.

If you are using a shared storage device: Before creating a cluster,
when you turn the computer on and start the operating system, it is
very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk.
Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the
corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node,
or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective
presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks before creating
the cluster. Also, before starting the installation of the second and
subsequent nodes, ensure that all disks that are to be managed by the
cluster have disk resources associated with them. If these disks do
not have disk resources associated with them at this time, the disk
data will be corrupted because the disks will not be protected and
multiple nodes will attempt to connect to them at the same time.

>>>TO SET UP YOUR CLUSTER USING CLUSTER ADMINISTRATOR

   1. Open Cluster Administrator by clicking Start, pointing to
      Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking
      Cluster Administrator.

   2. In the Open Connection to Cluster dialog box that appears, in
      Action, select Create new cluster, then click OK.

   3. The New Server Cluster Wizard appears. Click Next to continue.

   4. Upon completion of the New Server Cluster Wizard, click Finish.

         IMPORTANT: During the cluster creation process (using the
         Quorum button on the Proposed Cluster Configuration page)
         you will be able to select a quorum resource type (that is,
         a Local Quorum resource, Physical Disk or other storage
         class device resource, or Majority Node Set resource). For
         information on how these quorum resource types relate to the
         different cluster models, see "Quorum Resource Options"
         earlier in this text file. Do not use Manage Your Server or
         the Configure Your Server Wizard to configure cluster nodes.

@*:
@*: These values are used to help setup determine how
@*: much disk space is required for the %windir% (values
@*: are in KBytes).  Here's how it works:
@*:
@*: If we're doing a fresh install, we load the value
@*: below, which tells us how much space we think
@*: the %windir% will take.
@*:
@*: If we're doing an upgrade, the second step will
@*: be to go find out which OS we're running on.
@*: We use that to index into the 'upgrade' table
@*: below and pull how much a base install of that
@*: OS took.  We then subtract the two and that
@*: tells us how much the %windir% should grow.
@*: Note that for NT5 upgrades, we'll simply assume
@*: we need to grow the %windir% by 20Mb.
@*:
@*: Each entry cooresponds to space requirements on a drive
@*: with a given cluster size (between 512 bytes and 256K bytes).

@*: Whistler have multiple strings sections so that older applications
@*: (like win2k risetup) can read this file without requiring any change

@*:
@*: If we're doing a fresh install, we load the value
@*: below, which tells us how much space we think
@*: the %windir% will take.
@*:
@*: If we're doing an upgrade, the second step will
@*: be to go find out which OS we're running on.
@*: We use that to index into the 'upgrade' table
@*: below and pull how much a base install of that
@*: OS took.  We then subtract the two and that
@*: tells us how much the %windir% should grow.
@*: Note that for NT5 upgrades, we'll simply assume
@*: we need to grow the %windir% by 20Mb.
