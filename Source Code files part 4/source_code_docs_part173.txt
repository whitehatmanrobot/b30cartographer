//  Sample Name:    IFilter - Sample HTML Filter Implementation
//
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========
  The IFilter sample (HtmlFilt) is an example IFilter implementation for
  HTML files.  It is more complex than the basic text filter, because it
  demonstrates techniques for extracting both text-type and value-type
  properties.

Path
====
  Source: mssdk\samples\winbase\indexing\IFilter\
  
User's Guide
============
  * To build the sample
      1. Set the Lib environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Lib;%Lib%" and the
         Include environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Include;%Include%",
         where D: is the drive on which you installed the Platform SDK.
      2. Correctly set the CPU environment variable to, for example, "i386".
      3. Open a command window and change the directory to the source path
         of the sample.
      4. Build the filter DLL by entering, at the command-line prompt, "nmake".

  * To register the sample
      1. Copy the filter DLL file HtmlFilt.dll to your %windir%\System32
         directory.
      2. Self-register the filter by entering, at the command-line prompt,
         "regsvr32.exe %windir%\System32\htmlfilt.dll".
      3. Enable automatic registration of the filter by adding it to the value
         MULTI_SZ DLLsToRegister in the registry under the following key.
         
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex
         
      4. Remove the default HTML filter, nlhtml.dll, from the registry key
         given in Step 3.  If you don't perform this step, the default
         HTML filter will re-register when Indexing Service (IS) starts.

  *  To filter files and submit queries using the sample
      1. Create one or more appropriate HTML files to filter.  Or, check
         that you already have one or more HTML files with the appropriate
         sample title, headings, and anchors.
      2. Restart the CISVC service.  Touch the HTML files and wait for IS
         to filter them.
      3. Formulate queries that you know will succeed on the HTML files and
         submit them using the IS MMC snap-in or one of the sample query
         programs in the Platform SDK.

Programming Notes
=================
  HTMLFilt will extract text-type and value-type properties from HTML pages.
  In addition to extracting the body of the text as a text-type property,
  headings (levels 1 to 6), title, and anchors are extracted as internal
  value-type properties available using the IFilter::GetValue method.

Description
===========
  The Simple sample (QSample) is an example command-line application written
  in C++ that executes a query using the OLE DB Helper API functions
  CCreateICommand and CITextToFullTree to simplify the coding needed to
  create a query to an Indexing Service catalog.
  
Path
====
  Source: mssdk\samples\winbase\indexing\Simple\
  
User's Guide
============
  * To build the sample
      1. Set the Lib environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Lib;%Lib%" and the
         Include environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Include;%Include%",
         where D: is the drive on which you installed the Platform SDK.
      2. Correctly set the CPU environment variable to, for example, "i386".
      3. Open a command window and change the directory to the source path
         of the example.
      4. Build the example by entering, at the command-line prompt, "nmake".

  * To execute queries using the sample
      1. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         built sample.
      2. Formulate a query that you know will succeed.  You need to know the
         machine, catalog, scope, and query text.
      3. Submit the query by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         qsample <query> [arguments]

         where

         <query>         is an Indexing Service query.
         
         and the arguments can optionally include:
         
         /c:<catalog>    is the name of the catalog.
                             Default is "system".
         /d              specifies to display the command tree.
                             Default is not to display.
         /e:<locale>     is ISO locale identifier, e.g. EN-US.
                             Default is system locale.
         /f:(+|-)        + or - specifies forcing use of the index.
                             Default is +.
         /g              specifies forcing a master merge.
         /i:<inputfile>  specifies an input file to read with queries,
                             one per line.
         /j              specifies to return just files in the scope path,
                             and not subdirectories.
         /l:<dialect>    specifies the query language dialect, 1 or 2.
                             Default is 1.
         /m:<machine>    is the name of the computer.
                             Default is the local computer.
         /o:<columns>    is the output column list.  Default is path.
         /p:<scope>      is the scope path of the query, absolute or relative.
         /q              specifies to execute quietly.
                             Display only query results.
         /r:#            is the number of times to repeat the command.
         /s:<sort>       is the sort column list.  Default is none.
                             For example: write[d].  Append [a] for ascending
                             (default) or [d] for descending.
         /t              specifies to display catalog statistics.
         /u              specifies to check if the catalog is up to date.
         /x:<maxhits>    is the maximum number of hits to retrieve.
                             Default is no limit.

Programming Notes
=================
  This example is simpler than the AdvQuery sample because it uses the
  OLE DB Helper functions CICreateCommand and CITextToFullTree instead of
  creating a command tree and using the low-level ICommandTree interface.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========
  The SmpFilt sample is an example IFilter implementation that reads an un-
  formatted text file (with the extension .smp) using the ANSI code page of
  the current thread, and outputs UNICODE text for the current locale.  It
  accepts as input only single-byte-character text files and not multibyte-
  character or UNICODE text files.  It is the simplest example of an IFilter
  implementation included in the Indexing Service sample code.
  
Path
====
  Source: mssdk\samples\winbase\indexing\SmpFilt\
  
User's Guide
============
  * To build the sample
      1. Set the Lib environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Lib;%Lib%" and the
         Include environment variable to "D:\mssdk\Include;%Include%",
         where D: is the drive on which you installed the Platform SDK.
      2. Correctly set the CPU environment variable to, for example, "i386".
      3. Open a command window and change the directory to the source path
         of the sample.
      4. Build the filter DLL by entering, at the command-line prompt, "nmake".

  * To register the sample
      1. Copy the filter DLL file SmpFilt.dll to your %windir%\System32
         directory.
      2. Self-register the filter by entering, at the command-line prompt,
         "regsvr32.exe %windir%\System32\SmpFilt.dll".
      3. Enable automatic registration of the filter by adding it to the
         MULTI_SZ value of the DLLsToRegister entry in the registry under the
         following key.
         
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex

  * To filter files and submit queries using the sample
      1. Create one or more files to filter.  For example, copy the source
         file smpfilt.cxx to a file named smpfilt.smp.
      2. Restart the CISVC service.  Touch the .SMP files and wait for them
         to be filtered.
      3. Formulate queries that you know will succeed on the .SMP files and
         submit them using the IS MMC snap-in or one of the sample query
         programs in the Platform SDK.

Programming Notes
=================
  The SmpFilt sample illustrates the basic structure of a filter.  It
  minimally implements the methods of the IFilter and IPersistFile interfaces.
  Because the SmpFilt sample does not filter any value-type properties, the
  implementation of IFilter:GetChunk does not process properties other than
  "contents", and IFitler::GetValue always indicates no values.  For examples
  of how to filter value-type properties as well as text, refer to either the
  IFilter sample (HTMLFilt) or the HtmlProp sample in the Platform SDK.
  
  Error handling in the SmpFilt sample is rudimentary.  The sample handles
  only the most obvious error conditions.  Comments in the source code list
  all the standard result codes and indicate whether they are implemented or
  not.  If you use SmpFilt as a basis for your own filter, carefully determine
  the additional error conditions that you need to detect and handle.

User's Guide
============
  * To build the sample
      1. In the Visual Basic development environment, open the
         VBQuery.vbp project in the source path of the sample.
      2. In the File menu, select Make VBQuery.exe.
      3. In the Make Project dialog box, click OK.

  *  To execute queries using the sample
      1. Make sure that Indexing Service is started.
      2. In the Query text box, enter the query text. 
      3. In the Scope text box, enter the folder where you want to start
         the search.  You can click the button with "..." to display a
         dialog box to find a folder for the search Scope.
      4. In the Sort list box, select the way you want the application to
         sort the search hits.
      5. In the list box next to the Sort list, select the Indexing Service
         Query Language used to specify the query.
      6. Click Go to run the specified query or Clear to specify a new
         query.

Programming Notes
=================
  The VBQuery sample illustrates how you can use the Query and Util
  Automation objects of the Query Helper API to build applications
  that query a catalog.  The sample can process queries specified in any
  of the three query languages:
     * Query Language Dialect 1
     * Query Language Dialect 2
     * Structured Query Language (SQL)
     
  In addtion, the sample uses ADO objects to handle the recordsets returned
  by the Query Helper Automation objects.
  
  This sample also demonstrates making a DLL call to the LocateCatalogs
  function of the OLE DB Help API.  The application uses this function to
  locate catalogs suitable for the scope specified by the user.

Description
===========
  The SQuery sample consists of three scripts that execute using Windows
  Script Host.  VBSQuery is written in VBScript and performs a simple
  query.  JSQuery is a translation of VBSQuery to JScript.  QSample is
  written in VBScript and functions similarly to the C++ sample application
  Simple (QSample) with managing and querying functionality.

  Source: mssdk\samples\winbase\indexing\SQuery\
  
User's Guide
============
  * To execute queries using the VBSQuery.vbs or JSQuery.js scripts
      1. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         sample scripts.
      2. Submit a fixed query by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         cscript vbsquery.vbs
         or
         cscript jsquery.js
         
  * To execute queries using the QSample.vbs script
      1. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         sample scripts.
      2. Formulate a query that you know will succeed.  You need to know
         the query text and, optionally, values for the machine, catalog,
         scope, columns, query language dialect, locale,sort order, and
         other argument (see list below).
      3. Submit a query by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         cscript qsample.vbs <query> [arguments]

         where
         
         <query>         is an Indexing Service query.
         
         and the arguments can optionally include:
         
         /c:<catalog>    is the name of the catalog.
                             Default is SYSTEM.
         /e:<locale>     is ISO locale identifier, e.g. EN-US.
                             Default is system locale.
         /f:(+|-)        + or - specifies forcing use of the index.
                             Default is +.
         /g              specifies forcing a master merge.
         /i:<inputfile>  specifies an input file to read with queries,
                             one per line.
         /j              specifies to return just files in the scope path,
                             and not subdirectories.
         /l:<dialect>    specifies the query language dialect, 1 or 2.
                             Default is 1.
         /m:<machine>    is the name of the computer.
                             Default is the local computer.
         /o:<columns>    is the output column list.  Default is path.
         /p:<scope>      is the scope path of the query, absolute or relative.
         /q              specifies to execute quietly.
                             Display only query results.
         /r:#            is the number of times to repeat the command.
         /s:<sort>       is the sort column list.  Default is none.
                             For example: write[d].  Append [a] for ascending
                             (default) or [d] for descending.
         /t              specifies to display catalog statistics.
         /u              specifies to check if the catalog is up to date.
         /x:<maxhits>    is the maximum number of hits to retrieve.
                             Default is no limit.
         
Programming Notes
=================
  VBSQuery and JSQuery
  --------------------
    The query executed by these scripts is embedded in the script.  The query
    uses the Query Helper API and consists of the following.
     *  Columns = filename, directory, size, write
     *  Query = #filename *.asp
     *  GroupBy = directory[a]
     *  Catalog = system
     *  CiScope = \
     *  CiFlags = DEEP
     *  OptimizeFor = recall,hitcount
     *  AllowEnumeration = True
     *  MaxRecords = 20000

    The JSQuery is a direct translation of the VBSQuery script
    to JScript.  Its output is identical to that of VBSQuery except
    for a difference in the way dates and times are represented.

  QSample.vbs
  -----------
    QSample uses the Query Helper API and is much more general and
    flexible than the VBSQuery and JSQuery scripts.  It also uses
    the Admin Helper API to perform some managing tasks.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
      You can specify the following columns with the /o argument.
        * attrib
        * create

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========
  The VJQuery sample is an example command-line application written in
  Visual J++ that illustrates how to query Indexing Service using the SQL
  query language and the ADO API.

Path
====
  Source: mssdk\samples\winbase\indexing\VJQuery\
  
User's Guide
============
  * To build the sample
      1. In the Visual J++ development environment, open the
         VJQuery.vjp project from the source path of the sample.
      2. In the Build menu, select Build.

  * To execute a default query using the sample
      1. Make sure that Indexing Service is started.
      2. In the Debug menu, select Start.
      3. In the JView window, read the results of the default SQL query
      
         SELECT Filename, Size, Write, Path
           FROM SCOPE('DEEP TRAVERSAL OF "\"')
           WHERE CONTAINS('"Indexing Service"')

  * To specify a complete SQL statement for a query using the sample
      1. Make sure that Indexing Service is started.
      2. Set the PATH environment variable to include "D:\mssdk\Bin",
         where D: is the drive on which you installed the Platform SDK.
      3. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         built sample.
      4. Formulate a query that you know will succeed.  You need to know the
         machine, catalog, scope, and query text.
      5. Submit a complete SQL statement by entering, at the command-line
         prompt,
         
         jview /p /cp:p "<JAVAPACKAGES>" VJQuery -s <Statement>
           
         where <Statement> is a complete SQL statement such as the
         preceding default SQL query.  You must escape any double-quote
         characters in the text of the <Statement> parameter.

  * To specify only a WHERE clause for a query using the sample
	  1. Make sure that Indexing Service is started.
	  2. Set the PATH environment variable to include "D:\mssdk\Bin",
	     where D: is the drive on which you installed the Platform SDK.
	  3. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
	     built sample.
	  4. Formulate a query that you know will succeed.  You need to know the
	     machine, catalog, scope, and query text.
      5. Submit text for a WHERE clause that is concatenated to the
         following incomplete, fixed SQL statement
         
         SELECT Filename, Size, Write, Path
           FROM SCOPE('DEEP TRAVERSAL OF "\"')
           WHERE
         
         by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         jview /p /cp:p "<JAVAPACKAGES>" VJQuery <Where_Text>

         where <Where_Text> is the desired text to follow the WHERE keyword.
         You must escape any double quotes in the text of the <Where_Text>
         parameter.  For example, to duplicate the default SQL query, enter

         jview /p /cp:p "<JAVAPACKAGES>" VJQuery CONTAINS('\"Indexing Service\"')

Programming Notes
=================
  The Query class has methods that set the text of the query, execute the
  query, and display the results of the query.
    * Either the SetRawSql method or the SetSqlWhere method sets the
      m_SqlText variable to the specified SQL statement.
    * The Execute method executes the query.  It creates an ADO Recordset
      object and executes the query by opening the object with the SQL text
      and the OLE DB Provider for Indexing Service.
    * The Display method enumerates the resulting values of the fields from
      the Recordset object and prints them.

1. Two new samples have been installed: /samples/search/news1.htm and
   /samples/search/news2.htm.  The former demonstrates both full and
   summary hilighting of news articles.  The latter is a news-centric
   query form.

2. The adminstration of virtual roots has been changed to support
   news roots. /scripts/srchadm/admin.idq and /scripts/srchadm/admin.htx
   have been updated.

3. To enable hit hilighting via webhits.exe you must provide a valid virtual
   path to files in news roots. For every Internet News root, create an
   equivalent Internet Server root with $CiNews prepended.  Examples:

       News             Web
       --------------   ----------------

The Server-side objects (SSO) supporting the Index Server content indexes and query engine are described in detail. In integrating Index Server with Active Server Pages for scripting, two models will be available.  The method described here will permit setting query formulation parameters in a way that is familiar to users of Index Server 1.x, and then using Active Data Objects (ADO) to navigate and present results.  It is also possible to use ADO to specify a query using SQL extensions for content queries.  This can be done because Index Server 2.0 implements a complete OLE-DB provider.  This method of using ADO with ASP is not described in this document.  The IXSSO component supports two programmable objects.  The Query object is used for query formulation and to provide an ADO recordset that is used to navigate and display the result set.  The Utility object contains a set of miscellaneous methods that provide useful shortcuts for script writers, but which are not directly needed for query formulation.  The Olympus Net Library project will use a component that conforms to this specification.  It is extremely desirable for Index Server and Net Library to use the same code base if not the same binary.  If Olympus-specific behavior is required, it will be indicated by a unique progid and clsid, and the SSO will adapt itself accordingly. This scripting facility is independent of the support for Index Server processing of HTML extension (.HTX) files.  The SSO is not intended to provide administration capabilities for Index Server.  IDQ.DLL will remain pretty much as it is today to provide backward compatibility and administration The Index Server Query Object The Index Server Query object is an ActiveX server-side control (i.e., it is an automation object with a dual interface supporting IDispatch).  It uses properties to set query parameters and supports a few methods to create an ADO recordset and reflect the query parameters to and from the QueryString or Form collections.  The query object is named by  IXSSO.Query  (or  nlsso.Query  for the Olympus version). When first initialized, the Query object will attempt to look up a default column definition file in the registry and load these column definitions for use in all queries.  If the column definition file is not found, a built-in default set of columns is used.  Lines in the column definition file have the same format as the argument to the DefineColumn method below. Method and Properties Summary Settable Properties Property name Description Query The query specification SortBy Specification of sorting criteria GroupBy Specification of grouping criteria OptimizeFor Optimization constraints AllowEnumeration VARIANT_BOOL TRUE or FALSE LocaleID Specifies the locale to use for executing the query Columns List of columns available for retrieval in the ResultSet or Recordset Catalog The index directory. StartHit LONG or array of LONG Starting hit number. ResourceUseFactor Resource limit class for query MaxRecords Maximum number of records to retrieve. Read-only Properties Property name Description QueryTimedOut VARIANT_BOOL TRUE if query exceeded the time limit for execution, FALSE otherwise. QueryIncomplete VARIANT_BOOL TRUE if the query could not be resolved using the content index and AllowEnumeration was FALSE; FALSE otherwise. OutOfDate VARIANT_BOOL TRUE if the content index out of date; FALSE otherwise. Methods CreateRecordset Execute the query, produce a Recordset DefineColumn Define a column to be used in the query QueryToURL Produce the query string portion of a URL from the query parameters. Reset Clear the state of the query object SetQueryFromURL Set Query, et al., according to query string. Properties Query Syntax Tripolish  query string Comments: The Query property specifies documents should be returned in the search.  This is the  restriction , as it s known in Index Server. Example: Q.Query =  #filename *.htm and dog near cat Columns Syntax Fname1 [ , fname2 ]  Comments: The Columns property gives a comma-separated list of column friendly names that will appear as columns in the result.  The column names are case insensitive, and may be enclosed in quotes if they contain characters other than alphabetic and numeric characters. Example: Q.Columns =  DocAuthor, vpath, doctitle,  My funny column SortBy Syntax Fname1 [ [a]|[d] ] [ , fname2 [ [a]|[d] ] ]  Comments: Default sort order is ascending.  Grouping implies sorting first by primary keys specified in GroupBy property.  The optional [a] or [d] specifies an ascending or descending sort respectively. It has been suggested that rank could default to descending, but that s deemed too confusing.  We could also switch the default on seeing a direction specifier; this approach is taken in Monarch. Example: Q.SortBy =  DocAuthor, rank[d] GroupBy Syntax GroupBy ::= GroupingTerm [ , GroupingTerm ]  GroupingTerm ::= Unique | Quantile | Range | Cluster | TimeGroup | AlphaGroup Unique ::= [ [unique] ] fname1 [ [a|d] ] [ +  fname2 [ [a|d] ] ]  Quantile ::= [ [quantile] ] fname1 [ [a|d] ] [ + fname2 [ [a|d] ] ]    [ [ nbuckets ] ]  TimeGroup ::= [ [time] ] fname1 [ [a|d] ] [ [ TimeUnit ] ]  AlphaGroup ::= [ [alpha] ] fname1 [ [a|d] ] [ + fname2 [ [a|d] ] ]   [ [ nchars ] ]  Cluster ::= [ [cluster] ] fname1 [ + fname2 ]   [ [ maxclusters ] ]  Range ::= [ [range] ] fname1 [ ??? ]  To be specified TimeUnit ::= s | n | h | d | w | m | y | q Comments: Grouping specification. For all groupings (except by time), column names separated by a plus (+) are grouped together into individual categories and column names following a comma (,) are grouped together into subgroups of the previous grouping.  The optional [a] or [d] following a column name specifies the sort direction of the column in the grouping.  Each grouping may be prefixed by a keyword in brackets, which indicates the grouping type.  If the grouping type is omitted, it defaults to the grouping type for the previous grouping in the grouping specification, or [unique] for the first grouping in the grouping specification. In the unique grouping, unique values of the column set form the individual categories. In the quantile grouping, nbuckets approximately equal-sized categories are formed.  The break points between the categories are unspecified and free-floating to allow for the approximately equal distribution of result rows.  Nbuckets defaults to 10 if not given. In the time grouping, the named column is placed into a category according to the TimeUnit given.  The TimeUnit is one of s, n, h, d, w, m, y or q meaning seconds, minutes, hours, days (default), weeks, months, years or quarters respectively.  The column used for this categorization must of a type which can be interpreted as a timestamp, either DBTYPE_DATE or VT_FILETIME. In the alphabetic grouping, the categories are formed by examining the first nchars (default 1) characters of the named column set and folding upper and lower case together.  If multiple columns are specified in a grouping, the effect is as if the columns were concatenated together. In the range grouping, the break points between categories is specified explicitly.  The number of categories is the number of break points plus one.  The exact syntax is to be specified. In a clustering, one or more columns are grouped heuristically into clusters based upon a measure of similarity.  The maximum number of clusters is specified according to maxclusters.  There may be fewer than maxclusters clusters in the result. Not supported in Index Server 2.0.  Index Server 23.0 only supports the unique specification. Examples: Q.GroupBy =  [unique] DocAuthor Q.GroupBy =  [quantile] LastName[a]+FirstName[20] Catalog Syntax query://hostname/indexname Comments: The catalog is named with an URL-like syntax.  The hostname is the machine name where the catalog can be found and the indexname gives the catalog name on that machine.  Normal defaulting rules apply.  The hostname defaults to the local machine if not supplied.  The indexname defaults to the default catalog on the machine if not supplied. Example: Q.Catalog =  query://search.microsoft.com/kb StartHit Syntax Comments: The starting hit property is used to optimize restarting of a query in a multi-page result.  The value is a string supplied at the end of a page of results, which allows the query to quickly reposition to the next result when re-executed. Example: Q.StartHit = Request ( LocaleID LONG (LCID) Syntax number Comments: This property is used for the language code and optional country code used for the query.  The value is a Win32 LCID.  The ISOToLocaleID function can be used to map a string version of a locale to the value needed by this function. Example: Q.LocaleID = 1033      EN-US locale code OptimizeFor Syntax performance | recall [ [weight] ][ , hitcount | nohitcount ] Comments: This property replaces the Index Server parameter CiDeferNonIndexedTrimming.  If the option is set to performance, scope and security trimming are deferred until after the maximum number of hits is collected.  This may result in less than the expected number of hits to be returned for queries in which scope checks or security removes results.  The default is to optimize for recall. If the option is set to recall, the above mentioned result set trimming occurs in the course of executing the query.  The optional weight parameter is for future use.  Additional alternatives, or combinations may be permitted in the future (i.e., adding a precision keyword). The hitcount or nohitcount alternatives control whether a total hit count should be computed. For higher performance, set the value to nohitcount. When nohitcount is set, the hitcount property is not available from the rowset property collection.   This option is not available for Index Server 2.0. Example: Q.OptimizeFor =  performance,nohitcount AllowEnumeration VARIANT_BOOL Syntax TRUE | FALSE Comments: This property, if set to TRUE, allows queries to use enumeration to resolve the result set.  Otherwise, queries are forced to use indexes only for resolution.  The default value is FALSE. This property expresses the inverse of the Index Server parameter CiForceUseCI. Example: Q.AllowEnumeration = TRUE MaxRecords Syntax number Comments: Use the MaxRecords property to limit the number of records the provider returns from the data source. The default setting of this property is zero, which means the provider returns all requested records. The MaxRecords property is read/write when the Recordset is closed and read-only when it is open. Example: Q.MaxRecords = 200 ResourceUseFactor Syntax number Comments: The ResourceUseFactor property may be set in the range 1-5 to enforce a set of resource limit constraints on the execution of the query.  The number given selects one of five resource limit classes that are, by default, successively more generous in the consumption of resources.  Each resource limit class consists of a set of parameters (e.g., CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth) that limit the query execution.  Each parameter in each class can be overridden by the administrator.  The administrator may also set the default resource limit class and the maximum settable resource limit class. The default setting of this property is zero, which means the default resource limit class will be used. The ResourceUseFactor property is read/write when the Recordset is closed and read-only when it is open. Note:  KyleP will define the resource limit classes in detail, and he will also describe the cross-query parameter settings which will use a similar 1-5 scale. Note:  Should we allow numbers which are in the defined range of 1-5, but larger than the administrator-defined maximum to be silently set to the maximum?  This would allow the example below to work independently of what maximum was configured on the machine. Example: Q.ResourceUseFactor = 5  I really want these results Methods CreateRecordSet Execute a query and create an ADO Recordset for navigation of query results. Syntax RecordSet = CreateRecordSet( CursorType  ) Returns Returns an ADO RecordSet object for iterating over the results of the query. Arguments CursorType is one of  sequential nonsequential  to select whether a sequential (IRowset) or non-sequential (IRowsetScroll) recordset is created.  Remarks Any required parameters of the query, such as the Query property and the Columns property must have been set prior to calling CreateRecordset. Examples The following creates a sequential recordset. set recordset = Q.CreateRecordSet("sequential") DefineColumn Define the new  friendly name  for a column. Syntax DefineColumn strColumnDef   Returns Nothing. Arguments strColumnDef is a BSTR that defines the column.  The syntax of the column definition string is: fname [ ( type ) ] = propset-id [ prop-id |   prop-name  where fname is the friendly name given to the property, the optional type is the DBTYPE of the column (used in query restrictions), propset-id is a guid giving the property set ID for the column and prop-id or prop-name give the property ID or property name for the column. Remarks The fname may mask some previously defined or pre-defined column name.  DefineColumn may also be used to define an alternative friendly name (an alias) for some existing column. When the query object is first instantiated, there is a set of pre-defined columns already defined.  These pre-defined columns include a set of commonly-used built-in column definitions and a set read from a file which augments the built-in columns.  In the file, the format of column definitions is the same as it is for the DefineColumn method, with each column definition separated by a new line character. Examples Q.DefineColumn "DocAuthor(DBTYPE_STR|DBTYPE_BYREF) = F29F85E0-4FF9-1068-AB91-08002B27B3D9 4" QueryToURL Produce a URL string reflecting the state of the query object. Syntax strQueryString = QueryToURL() Returns StrQueryString is a BSTR that gives the CGI QueryString.  This string is escaped for use in a URL. Arguments None. Remarks Note:  Should there be a variant that produces hidden form variables also? Examples Href =  http://server/foo.asp?  & Q.QueryToURL() Response.Write  <A Href=  & href &  >Next page</A> Reset Reset the state of the query object. Syntax Reset Returns Nothing. Arguments None. Remarks The Reset method clears any internal state in the query object.  Examples Q.Reset SetQueryFromURL Set query parameters from a web client request. Syntax SetQueryFromURL( strQueryString  ) Returns Nothing. Arguments strQueryString is a BSTR that gives the CGI QueryString.  This input string is assumed to be URL-encoded. Remarks The state of the query object is not reset prior to loading the query string values.  Unrecognized tag names in the query string are ignored. Note:  It seems like it would be useful to have a version that takes a Denali collection; either the Form collection or the QueryString collection. Examples Q.SetQueryFromURL("qu=%40size+%3E+10000&so=rank%5bd%5d&mh=200") The Index Server Utility Object The Index Server Utility object is an ActiveX server-side control (i.e., it is an automation object with a dual interface supporting IDispatch).  It consists of a variety of methods that may be helpful to script writers when using the Index Server query object. The utility object is named by  IXSSO.Utility .The following line displays the DocTitle column of the current record, on  No Title  if the title is NULL. <% = result.Column( DocTitle No Title Utility Method Summary AddScopeToQuery Add a scope restriction to a query specification. GetArrayElement Access a safearray vector element ISOToLocaleID Convert a language code into a Win32 LCID. LocaleIDToISO Convert a Win32 LCID into a language code. TruncateToWhitespace Truncate a string at a whitespace character. Methods AddScopeToQuery Add a scope restriction to a query specification.  Syntax AddScopeToQuery QueryObj, Path [ , Depth ] Returns Nothing. Arguments QueryObj is the query object to be modified is the scope to be added Depth is the depth of the scoping restriction, either  SHALLOW .  If not present, it defaults to  Remarks AddScopeToQuery is equivalent to modifying the Tripolish query string thus: if depth =  SHALLOW  then  depth_op =  BELOW_ SHALLOW else  depth_op =  BELOW_ DEEP end if Q.query =  Q.query &  ) AND (  & @path_column   & depth_op &   & path &  Examples util.AddScopeToQuery Q,  GetArrayElement Access a variant array element. Syntax varResult  = GetArrayElement( varArray, iElem ) Returns varResult  is a variant that contains the iElem element of varArray. Arguments varArray is a variant containing a singly-dimensioned safearray. IElem identifies the array element that should be returned. Remarks If varArray is not a safearray, or iElem is either less than the lower bound of varArray or more than the higher bound of varArray, the type of varResult will be VT_EMPTY. Examples Request.Write (Util.GetArrayElement( RS( vector-col ), i ) ) ISOToLocaleID Convert an ISO 639 language code into a win32 LCID. Syntax LocaleID  = ISOToLocaleID( strLanguage ) Returns LocaleID  is a Win 32 LCID that gives the translation of the ISO language code in strLanguage. Arguments strLanguage is a client browser language string from the HTTP Accept-Language header. Remarks The first recognized language code found in the input string is converted to a Win32 Locale identifier (LCID).  The recognized language codes include all those from the ISO 639 standard that map to Win32 language IDs, and some country codes that have sub-language codes in Win32.  If a language code is recognized, but the country code is not, the language code alone will be used unless there is a better match later in the string.  In addition to the ISO language codes, the name  neutral  can be used. If there is no matching language code, -1 is returned. Examples Lcid = Util.ISOToLocaleID( Request.QueryString( HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE LocaleIDToISO Convert a win32 LCID into an ISO 639 language code.  Syntax strLanguage = LocaleIDToISO( LocaleID ) Returns strLanguage is the name of the language identified by LocaleID. Arguments LocaleID  is a Win 32 LCID to be translated. Remarks Examples Response.Write  Language is   & Util.LocaleIDToISO() TruncateToWhitespace Truncate a string at a whitespace character.  Syntax NewString  = TruncateToWhitespace( String, Length  ) Returns NewString is the truncated string Arguments String is the string to be truncated Length is the maximum length of the string Remarks The purpose of the method is to allow script writers to display short forms of long properties like description without truncating in the middle of a word. It is impractical to use word breakers for this function. There is no equivalent routine for Oriental languages. Examples Response.Write util.TruncateToWhitespace(RS( Characterization ), 200) Conventional Form and QUERY_STRING Variables s unnecessary to have the SSO define the QUERY_STRING variables that will be used to encode query parameters, since anyone who authors a .ASP page can do their own parsing of the Request.Form or Request.QueryString collections themselves.  However, as a convenience for ASP authors, and to encourage the use of conventional parameters, the SSO provides the SetQueryFromURL and QueryToURL methods. This section defines the URL tags in the QUERY_STRING used by these methods. Full text of query.  Associated with the Query property. Sort.  Associated with the SortBy property. Sort down.  Associated with the SortBy property, but specifies a descending sort. Catalog.  Associated with the Catalog property. Grouping.  Associated with the GroupBy property. Group down.  Associated with the GroupBy property, but specifies a descending ordering. Maximum hits.  Associated with the MaxRecords property. Start hit.  Associated with the StartHit property. Allow Enumeration.  Associated with the AllowEnumeration property.  If set to a non-zero digit, enumeration is allowed. Optimize for.  Associated with the OptimizeFor property.  A string of characters which may consist of The first character of the value may be x for  performance , or r for  recall  or h for  nohitcount The following tags are used to create  built-up  query strings.  In each, the n  is a single digit in the range 0-9.  The column, operator and query for each numeric value make up a query term which is combined with the full-text query string and other query terms using the   operator. Column for built-up query.  Associated with the Query property. Operator for built-up query.  Associated with the Query property. Query string for built-up query.  Associated with the Query property. Creating an ADO Recordset Object ADO Recordsets will be used for access to the rows and columns of a query result.  For pagination of results, the Recordset properties PageSize and AbsolutePage are used.  Note that the AbsolutePage property is only usable when the recordset is not forward-only.

Is there anything we need access to that ADO does not provide?  E.g., query state from IRowsetQueryStatus.  Should hit highlighting be exposed through the SSO as well?  This could permit finer-grained control of the way in which the expansion of the document is handled.  It has been suggested that these properties of the query object be exposed as rowset properties through ADO.  There are issues with this approach that need to be investigated, e.g., how will the names of the properties be exposed through ADO?  For Index Server 2.0, this is the IS 1.x dialect of Tripolish.  As described here, the catalog is single-valued.  This will be the case for Index Server 2.0.  For the NT5.0 version of Index Server 3.0 and Olympus, we can make this can be a comma-separated list of catalog URLs to allow for distributed search.  The StartHit value needs to be supported in the rowset implementation as either a column or a rowset property.  There is a naming issue with using a property in ADO (i.e., how will ADO know the name of an extension property).  In a future releaserelease, this will be true.  For Index Server 2.0, the BELOW_SHALLOW and BELOW_DEEP operators will not exist.  There is currently a bug in ADO that causes an off-by-one error in the AbsolutePosition property when used with rowsets supporting IRowsetScroll.

bears the project code name Whistler.

This text file series helps you plan for the installation of
Whistler Advanced Server on a domain (grouping) of two to five
servers, serving 100 or fewer clients. For help with planning the
installation of a larger number of servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 
2000 Server Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

After making the decisions outlined in this text file series, you'll
be ready to run Whistler Setup and, later, to use the Configure Your
Server Wizard. Together, Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard 
help you get your servers up and running quickly. To find out more 
about the Configure Your Server Wizard, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen
hardware that supports Whistler Advanced Server.

1.1   System Requirements
======================================================================

To ensure adequate performance, the computers on which you
will install Whistler Advanced Server must meet the following 
requirements:

 * Pentium or higher central processing unit (CPU). 

   * On x86-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 233 
     MHz, with a recommended speed of 550 MHz.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 
     800 MHz. 

 * A maximum of 8 CPUs per computer are supported.

 * RAM:

   * On x86-based computers, 256 MB of RAM is recommended, while the
     minimum amount of RAM required is 128 MB and the maximum is 
     32 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum amount of RAM required is
     1 GB. 

   For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, see the Hardware
   Compatibility List (HCL), described in "Hardware Compatibility"
   later in this text file series. 

 * Hard disk partition: the minimum amount of space required is 
   approximately 1 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the 
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than a new installation, because
     the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as
     a factor of ten during the upgrade as Active Directory
     functionality is added.

     Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in 
     The previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard 
     disk space used for the operating system (excluding user 
     accounts) is usually less than the free space required for Setup, 
     depending on the system components installed.

   For additional information about planning the sizes of disk
   partitions, including information about creating a separate 
   partition for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning 
   Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this text 
   file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL. The HCL is described in the following section,
   "Hardware Compatibility."

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the setup files.

1.2   Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Whistler Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and
reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful installation,
however, check to make sure your computer hardware is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server before running Setup.

To do this, see the Whistler Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). If
your hardware is not listed, Setup might not be successful. (Note that
one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.)

To see the version of the HCL that was released with Whistler, on the
Whistler CD, in the Support folder, open Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-
date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List 
by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/

In addition, check that you have updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based
computer) or Extensible Firmware Interface (for an Itanium-based
computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these
items. For more information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see
"Understanding ACPI BIOS" later in this text file series.

Finally, before installing Whistler Advanced Server, consider taking
a device inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more
information, see the following section.

1.3   Taking an Optional Device Inventory
======================================================================

To ensure smooth functioning of your adapters and other devices in
your computer, be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file series. For specific
information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI,
RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the
manufacturer, see "Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File"
later in this text file series.

Whistler includes Plug and Play technology so that devices (for
example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized
by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you
do not have to specify each device's settings by hand. However, if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your
Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards,
you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts.
This section describes the steps you can take, if you choose, to
understand your device configuration before running Setup.

To better understand the configuration of the devices in your
computer, take an inventory. To do this, if your computer has an
existing operating system, use it to obtain the current settings, such
as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices.
For example, with Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view
settings (on the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel,
and then double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also
choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen
while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when
prompted.

During Setup, Whistler automatically takes a device inventory as
well. However, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following
difficulties:

 * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
   Whistler might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent
   this, you can take one of two approaches.

   You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and 
   re-install it afterward. For more information about hardware and 
   configuration, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
   and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
   click Help and Support.

   Alternatively, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
   memory addresses before running Setup so that each adapter's
   settings are unique.

 * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
   Whistler to detect or enumerate them, Whistler might receive
   indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you
   might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and 
   re-install and configure them afterward. For more information 
   about hardware and for configuration guidance, see Whistler Help 
   and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
   completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather before
starting Setup.

                      slots

1.3.1   Understanding ACPI BIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For x86-based computers, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a
set of software through which the operating system (or Setup)
communicates with the computer's hardware devices. The Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for
the way the BIOS works. Whistler supports not only ACPI-compliant BIOS
versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power
management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions that 
appear on your screen.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

 * For information about which ACPI-based BIOS versions are 
   ACPI-compliant, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for
   Whistler. This is the definitive source for this information.
   For information about the HCL, see "Hardware Compatibility"
   earlier in this text file series.

 * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
   restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
   particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
   "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

 * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, see your
   hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.


======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup,
familiarize yourself with important files found on the root directory
of the Whistler Advanced Server CD:

 * Read1st.txt  Contains critical preinstallation notes vital to the
                success of your installation.

 * Readme.doc   Contains important usage information about hardware,
                networks, applications, and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for Whistler
Advanced Server. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility"
earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
3.0   Deciding Whether to Upgrade or Install
======================================================================

After you have reviewed "System Requirements," "Hardware
Compatibility," and "Important Files to Review" earlier in this text
file series, and before you run Whistler Advanced Server Setup, you
will need to determine whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation. Upgrading is replacing a version of Windows NT or
Windows 2000 with Whistler Advanced Server. Installing, in contrast
to upgrading, means wiping out the previous operating system, or
installing Whistler Advanced Server on a disk or disk partition with
no previous operating system.

Note: Do not upgrade to or install Whistler on a compressed drive 
Unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression 
utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume before running 
Whistler Setup on it.

If you have already decided whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation, see the following sections later in this text file
series:

 * For an upgrade: see "Decisions to Make for an Upgrade."

 * For a new installation: see "Decisions to Make for a New
   Installation."

There are several reasons to choose to upgrade. (To determine whether
your old operating system is a version from which you can upgrade, see
the following section, "Upgrading.") Configuration is simpler, and 
your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are
retained. In addition, files and applications do not need to be 
re-installed. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, 
you should back up the disk before running Setup.

It is possible to install Whistler Advanced Server and also allow the
computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the
computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file
system issues. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this text file
series.

3.1   Upgrading
======================================================================

If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Whistler into the same
folder as the currently installed operating system. You can upgrade 
to Whistler Advanced Server from the following versions of Windows:

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition

 * Windows 2000 Server

 * Windows 2000 Advanced Server

If your computer is running Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, 
you can upgrade to Whistler Advanced Server, but not Whistler Server.

Note: If you are running a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0, you cannot upgrade directly to Whistler from it. You must first upgrade to Windows NT Server 4.0.

3.2   Installing
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a new installation, note that:

 * For a new installation on a disk partition that contains
   applications you want to keep, you must back up the applications 
   and re-install them after installing Whistler Advanced Server.

 * If you want to perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server on a partition that previously contained Whistler
   Advanced Server, and if you want to keep any documents saved in the 
   My Documents folder, back them up before beginning the 
   installation. You can use Search to find the documents. After 
   completing the new installation, you can copy the documents back to 
   the My Documents folder.


======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, and you have a Windows NT 4.0 domain, you will
need to decide on the order of server upgrades. For more information,
see the following sections later in this text file series:

 * "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers
   First"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers
   First"

In addition, if you are upgrading from Windows NT 4.0, you will need
to decide whether to convert the file system, on any FAT or FAT32
partitions you might have, to the NTFS file system. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.


======================================================================
5.0   Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

Domains are an important feature of Windows servers and clients. A
domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a single
domain name and security boundary. It is necessary to have one or more
domains if you want to use domain-based user accounts and other domain
security features in Whistler. (This was true for Windows NT and
Windows 2000 as well.) 

On computers running Whistler, servers can have one of three roles in 
relation to domains:

 * Domain controllers contain matching copies of the user accounts
   and other Active Directory data in a given domain.

 * Member servers belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the
   Active Directory data.

 * Stand-alone servers belong to a workgroup rather than a domain.

A domain must have at least one domain controller. For resilience, a
domain should have multiple domain controllers to support the handling
of logon requests and directory updates.

Before running Setup, you should plan the roles that your servers will 
Have within domains in Whistler. However, you can still adjust these 
roles after completing Setup.

There are a number of important points to remember about upgrading an
existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to run with Whistler:

 * You must use the NTFS file system on domain controllers. In
   addition, any servers that have any partition formatted with FAT
   or FAT32 will lack many security features. For example, on FAT
   or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by
   the permissions set on the share, not on individual files, and
   there is no software protection against local access to the
   partition.

 * If you want to upgrade a server and then use the same applications
   as before, be sure to read about application compatibility.

   One important source of application compatibility information is
   Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility section of Readme.doc 
   (in the root directory of the Whistler CD). For more information
   about these files, see "Important Files to Review" earlier in
   this text file series.

 * You can upgrade member servers before or after upgrading domain
   controllers. However, when you upgrade the domain controllers in
   a Windows NT domain to Whistler, you must upgrade the primary
   domain controller first.

 * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
   access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it before 
   the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a server is dependent 
   on domain controllers for user information and therefore should not 
   be "left behind" when domain controllers are upgraded. As an 
   alternative, you can weakendecrease the security permissions on 
   Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows 
   NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. 
   For more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
   Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

The roles of the servers in a domain are named somewhat differently
by computers running Whistler Advanced Server as compared with those 
running Windows NT. On computers running Windows NT, the possible 
roles were primary domain controller (limited to one per domain), 
backup domain controller, member server, or stand-alone server. 
Whistler has only one kind of domain controller (without a
"primary" or "backup" designation), and it includes the roles of
member server and stand-alone server. When you upgrade, Setup assigns
server roles as follows:

ROLE IN WINDOWS NT DOMAIN   ROLE IN WHISTLER DOMAIN
--------------------------  ---------------------------------------
Primary domain controller   Domain controller

Backup domain controller    Your choice of domain controller or
                            member server

Member server               Member server

Stand-alone server          Stand-alone server


5.1   Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

When planning the order of server upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
domain, there are two somewhat different approaches to choose between: 
upgrading the domain controllers first, or upgrading the member 
servers first. You can mix these approaches. However, if you have a 
Windows NT domain and you want to begin upgrading domain controllers, 
you must upgrade the primary domain controller first.

If you upgrade member servers first (without upgrading domain
controllers), a variety of features become available, but none that
require Active Directory. Once you begin upgrading domain controllers,
Active Directory features become available.

For additional information about planning the order of server
upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 domain, see the following:

 * For background information about server roles (which you must
   understand to plan the order of server upgrades), see "Upgrading
   an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * For more detailed information about upgrading domains, or
   information about upgrading domains with more than five servers,
   see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, Deployment 
   Planning Guide."

 * For information about how to carry out each kind of upgrade, see
   "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain
   Controllers First" or "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by
   Upgrading Member Servers First" later in this text file series.

The lists in "Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0
Domain Controllers" and "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain," later in this text file series, show the
features that are available with each approach to upgrading servers.

5.1.1   Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 Domain 
Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When Windows NT domain controllers are upgraded and begin
communicating on a network, all the features of Whistler become
available through these servers. Of these features, the Active
Directory features are listed in this section, and a number of other
features are listed in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Note: The features available when domain controllers are upgraded 
include not only the features in the following list, but also the 
features in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a 
Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Active Directory includes the following features:

 * Simplified management of network-resource information and user
   information.

 * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
   a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active
   Directory.

 * Security and authentication features, including support for
   Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer V3, and Transport Layer
   Security using X.509v3 certificates.

 * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
   simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
   devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
   they need. You can take advantage of synchronization support
   through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) and work with directory consolidation
   requirements specific to your applications.

 * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make 
   it easier to configure and manage applications and other 
   directory-enabled network components.

 * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
   scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
   technology and advanced replication techniques to speed
   performance.

 * Use of Internet standards, including access through LDAP and a 
   namespace based on the Domain Name System (DNS).

 * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful development
   environment.

 * Additional features.

5.1.2   Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows 
NT 4.0 Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The features in the following list are available when member servers
are upgraded in a Windows NT domain, regardless of whether domain
controllers have been upgraded. The features available when domain
controllers are upgraded include not only the features in the
following list, but also the features in the previous one.

 * Management tools:
   Microsoft Management Console
   Plug and Play
   Device Manager
   Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
   Support for universal serial bus
   Enhanced Backup utility

 * File system support: The version of NTFS in Whistler includes
   support for disk quotas, the ability to defragment directory
   structures, and compressed network I/O.

 * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and Windows
   Script Host.

 * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
   choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
   enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
   Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
   over an intranet or the Internet.

 * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
   support as compared to Windows NT.

 * Security: Encrypting file system.

5.2   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. If you are not sure which approach you want to take,
see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file series.

If you upgrade your Windows NT domain by upgrading the domain
controllers first, the upgrade has the following three stages:

 * Carrying out backups and other preparations so you can restore the
   previous installation if necessary.

 * Upgrading the primary domain controller. You must do this before
   upgrading any backup domain controllers.

 * Upgrading other servers in the domain.

This section describes the actions to take for these stages. For a
more in-depth discussion of planning the upgrade of domain
controllers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide." For information about what versions of 
Windows NT can be upgraded to Whistler Advanced Server, see 
"Upgrading" earlier in this text file series.

5.2.1   Backups and Other Preparations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your 
servers, you should back up each server before upgrading it. Also, be 
sure to review "Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this 
text file series.

In addition, to safeguard your existing network integrity, you might
consider removing a backup domain controller temporarily from a
network. To do this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a
backup domain controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the
user accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
cable. After upgrading your primary domain controller to Whistler (you
must upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
controller if needed. However, in the course of a successful upgrade,
you would not and could not promote the Windows NT backup domain
controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would continue
the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the disconnected server
and upgrading it.

Also, for any computer that will be a domain controller in the
Whistler domain, make sure that there is plenty of free space on the 
disk, beyond the space needed for the operating system itself. (For
information about the disk requirements for the operating system, see
"System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.) When Setup
upgrades the user accounts database from the format used by Windows NT
to the format used by Whistler Advanced Server, the database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten.

5.2.2   Upgrading Servers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first domain controller to be upgraded in a Windows NT domain
must be the primary domain controller. As you upgrade this server, you
will be given the choices of creating a new domain or a child domain,
and of creating a new forest or a domain tree in an existing forest.
For the upgrading of a domain of two to five servers (which is the
size of domains discussed in this text file series), create a new
domain and a new forest. For information about domain structures to
use with larger numbers of servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three important
items: the database containing user accounts and other Active
Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (SYSVOL) folder.
The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition (FAT,
FAT32, or NTFS). The database can expand by as much as a factor of ten
from the size it was in Windows NT, so allow plenty of room for it.
(Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The SYSVOL 
folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information about
NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System" later in
this text file series.)

After the primary domain controller is upgraded to a Whistler domain
controller, it will be fully backward-compatible. This means that the
domain controller appears as a Whistler domain controller to Whistler
servers and clients, but emulates a Windows NT 4.0 primary domain
controller to Windows NT 4.0 servers and clients.

After upgrading your primary domain controller and ensuring that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, upgrade any backup domain
controllers next. (If possible, it is best to begin the upgrades soon,
rather than allowing a long delay.) Also, if you are running a remote 
access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it
before the last domain controller is upgraded. A remote-access member
server is dependent on domain controllers for user information and
therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers are
upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security permissions
on Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows
NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. For
more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

Note: When the second domain controller is upgraded, it copies the 
first (formerly the primary) domain controller. Therefore, be sure 
that the first domain controller is running and available on the 
network as you upgrade the second. Similarly, be sure that at least 
one Whistler domain controller is available on the network when you 
upgrade the third, fourth, and any remaining Windows NT domain 
controllers.

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Start and test each server on the
network to ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction before
upgrading another backup domain controller.

When you have completely upgraded all domain controllers to Whistler
domain controllers, you have the option of changing the domain from
mixed mode (where Windows NT domain controllers can exist in the
domain) to native mode (where only Whistler domain controllers can
exist in the domain). This is an important decision, because you
cannot revert to mixed mode after changing to native mode.

For information about domain trees, mixed mode, native mode, or any
other item related to domains, see the topics under Active Directory 
in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support 
Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support. For information about performing upgrades in domains larger 
than two to five servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

5.3   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers 
First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. For information about the advantages and disadvantages of each
approach, see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT
4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

Note: If you have a remote access server that is a member server, and 
you have begun upgrading any domain controllers, be sure to read 
"Upgrading Servers" earlier in this text file series.

Before upgrading any server, be sure to back it up, and review 
"Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this text file series.

If you upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by upgrading member servers
first, you can upgrade one, a few, or all of the member servers at a
given time. Choose the order of the upgrades by considering which of
your servers would be most improved by the features in the Whistler
Server family. For information about the features available when
member servers are upgraded, see "Features Available with Upgrade of
Any Server in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
series.

After upgrading member servers in a domain, when you are ready to
upgrade domain controllers, follow the instructions in "Upgrading a
Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First" earlier
in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic decisions you will need to make
if you have decided to perform a new installation. Each area is
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. You will need 
to consider the following:

6.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

6.2   Whether You Want to Be Able to Choose Between Different 
Operating Systems Each Time You Start the Computer
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" later in this text file series.

6.3   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. You should 
use NTFS because it is the only file system that supports Active
Directory, which includes many important features such as domains and
domain-based security. However, it might be necessary to have a FAT or
FAT32 partition in situations where you must set up a computer so that
it sometimes runs Whistler and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or an
earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System" later in this text file series.

6.4   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a 
New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

If you are performing a new installation, you will need to review
your disk partitions before running Setup (for an upgrade, you will
use existing partitions). A partition divides a disk into one or more
areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). After running Setup, you can modify the partitioning of the disk.
For information about planning the partitions for a new installation,
see "Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this
text file series.

6.5   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Advanced Server. You can install these components
during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the Configure
Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components for you
according to the type of server you specify. For more information
about components, see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this
text file series.

6.6   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

6.7   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier
in this text file series and "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, 
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Advanced Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

     Planning Your Microsoft Whistler Advanced Server Installation
                     Release Notes, Part 2 of 4
                              Beta 2

**********************************************************************

         (c) 2001 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.


These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.


======================================================================
8.0   Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems each time you restart the computer. For example, you
could set up a server to run Whistler Advanced Server most of the time
but allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise 
Edition in order to support an older application. (However, to do this 
you would need to make specific file system choices and would probably 
need the latest released Service Pack, as described in "Multiple 
Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" and "Choosing a File 
System" later in this text file series.) During restart, you can 
select which of the two operating systems you want to run. (You can 
specify a default operating system that will run if no selection is 
made during the restart process.)

Important: If you set up a computer so that the installed operating systems include Whistler and any other operating system, you must 
Install Whistler in a separate partition on the computer. (A partition 
divides a disk into sections that function as separate units and
that can be formatted for use by a file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters, for example, C and
D). Installing Whistler in a separate partition ensures that it will
not overwrite crucial files used by the other operating system.

The reason for setting up a computer so that you can choose between
two or more operating systems at startup is that you can use
applications that run only with a particular operating system. There
are definite drawbacks to setting up a computer this way, however:
each operating system uses valuable disk space, and compatibility
issues, especially file system compatibility, can be complex. In
addition, you cannot use dynamic disks (a storage type available in
Whistler) with some operating systems. The only operating systems that
can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.

Note: If you are considering setting up a computer with more than one
operating system to ensure that you will always have a way to
start the computer (regardless of driver or disk problems), first
take into account the variety of disaster-recovery features
available in Whistler. One example of these features is safe mode,
in which Whistler restarts with default settings and the minimum
number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even if a new
driver is causing a problem). With this and a variety of other
disaster-recovery features, it is not necessary to maintain more
than one operating system as a safeguard against system problems.
Avoiding multiple operating systems means you also avoid 
file system compatibility issues and other drawbacks. For more
information about disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

Before deciding to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain MS-DOS and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system in a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system in the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it in two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT.

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 95 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT. (For Windows 95
   OSR2, the primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.)

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 95. 

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 98 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 98. 

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler:

 * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" 
   and "Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced
   Server" later in this text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 2000 and Whistler or that contain
multiple Whistler partitions:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * When installing Whistler on a partition, you can choose any
   product in the Whistler product family. For example, for a
   computer containing multiple Whistler partitions, you could
   install Whistler Advanced Server on one partition and Whistler
   Professional on another.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS), you must take
   certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be available
   from each of the installations. For more information,
   see "Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System"
   later in this text file series.

8.1   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
======================================================================

On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it supports
important features, including Active Directory and domain-based
security. With NTFS, however, you need to take file system
compatibility into account when considering whether to set up a
computer to contain more than one operating system, because the
version of NTFS in Windows 2000 and Whistler has new features in
addition to those in Windows NT. Files that use any new features will
be completely usable or readable only when the computer is started
with Windows 2000 or Whistler. For example, a file that uses the new
encryption feature won't be readable when the computer is started with
Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, which were
released before the encryption feature existed. For more information
about features that affect file accessibility with Whistler, see
"NTFS" later in this text file series.

Note: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT and 
Whistler, and you want to have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate
version of Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released
Service Pack. Using the latest Service Pack maximizes
compatibility between Windows NT 4.0 and the updated NTFS file
system used with Whistler Advanced Server. (Specifically, this
compatibility in file systems is provided by Service Pack 4 and
later Service Packs.) Even the latest Service Pack, however, does
not provide access to files using the new features in NTFS.
Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. On these computers, a
FAT partition containing the Windows NT 4.0 operating system
ensures that when started with Windows NT 4.0, the computer will
have access to needed files.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Whistler Advanced Server on an NTFS
partition, when that computer starts with Windows NT 3.51, the NTFS
partition will not be visible.

8.2   Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Before you set up a computer that contains Windows NT 4.0
and Whistler Advanced Server, review the following precautions:

 * If your only concern is ensuring that you can always start the
   computer, setting up the computer so that you can start it with
   different operating systems at different times is not necessary.
   For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
   Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
   file series.

 * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
   Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. For more
   information, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
   Compatibility" earlier in this text file series.

 * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
   released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
   Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server (as opposed to an upgrade), by default, the installation
   is placed on a partition on which no other operating system is
   located. You can specify a different partition during Setup.

 * Don't install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the drive was
   compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation.

For more information about computers that contain multiple operating
systems, see the Windows 2000 Resource Kits.

8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System
======================================================================

If you set up a server so that it contains Windows 2000 and Whistler
or contains multiple Whistler partitions, and you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain
steps. These steps make encrypted files readable between the different
installations.

 * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
   same domain and that the user of these installations has a
   roaming profile.

 * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

There is one situation in which you might want to choose FAT or FAT32
as your file system. If it is necessary to have a computer that will
sometimes run Whistler and sometimes run Windows NT or an earlier
operating system, you will need to have a FAT or FAT32 partition as
the primary (or startup) partition on the hard disk. This is because
these earlier operating systems, with one exception, can't access a
partition if it uses the latest version of NTFS. The one exception is
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later, which has access
to partitions with the latest version of NTFS, but with some
limitations. Windows NT 4.0 cannot access files that have been stored
using NTFS features that did not exist when Windows NT 4.0 was
released. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
Contain More Than One Operating System" and "Multiple Operating
Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
series.

For anything other than a situation with multiple operating systems,
however, the recommended file system is NTFS.

The following list describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems. 

 * NTFS: A computer running Windows 2000 or Whistler can access files
   on an NTFS partition. A computer running Windows NT 4.0 with
   Service Pack 4 or later might be able to access some files.
   Other operating systems allow no access.

 * FAT: Access is available through MS-DOS, all versions of Windows,
   Windows NT, Whistler, and OS/2.

 * FAT32: Access is available only through Windows 95 OSR2, 
   Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Whistler.

The following list compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.

 * NTFS: Recommended minimum volume size is approximately 10 MB.
   Recommended practical maximum for volumes is 2 TB (terabytes). Much
   larger sizes are possible.
   Cannot be used on floppy disks.
   File size limited only by size of volume.

 * FAT: Volumes from floppy disk size up to 4 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 2 GB.

 * FAT32: Volumes from 512 MB to 2 TB.
   In Whistler, you can format a FAT32 volume only up to 32 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 4 GB.

Note: If you choose to format a partition as FAT during Setup and the
partition is larger than 2 GB, Setup will automatically format it
as FAT32.

9.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some of the features you can use when you choose NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory, and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in Whistler.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
choice of whether to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your 
files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format 
the partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.


======================================================================
10.0   Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations
======================================================================

You will need to plan your disk partitions before running Setup only
if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. Disk
partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a
disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by a file system such as FAT or NTFS. Different partitions
often have different drive letters (for example, C and D). A
primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you can
install the files needed to load an operating system such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
(Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.)

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Advanced Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Advanced Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. This 
allows space for a variety of items, including optional components, 
user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future service 
packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you
can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. (Note that you cannot use dynamic disks on some computers
that contain multiple operating systems. The only operating systems
that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.)

Important: If you're setting up a computer so that it contains multiple operating systems, you must install Whistler on its own 
partition. This ensures that Whistler will not overwrite crucial files 
needed by the other operating system. For more information, see 
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating 
System" earlier in this text file series.

10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (2 GB of space is recommended, but you might need less,
depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for the
system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk. (However, you cannot use dynamic disks on
some computers that contain multiple operating systems. The only
operating systems that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and
Whistler.)

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.


======================================================================
11.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

SERVER FUNCTION        POSSIBLE COMPONENTS

The following list describes the components in the preceding table 
and all other components that you can install.

Accessories and Utilities
  Includes desktop accessories such as WordPad, Paint, Calculator, 
  and CD Player, as well as the Accessibility Wizard. To select 
  individual items, in the Windows Components Wizard, select 
  Accessories and Utilities, click Details, and then select the 
  subcomponents you want from the list.

Certificate Services
  Provides security and authentication support, including secure 
  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), File
  Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation 
  of phone books that can be automatically updated from a central 
  server. In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes 
  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows 
  Management Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool 
  for creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications 
  can communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers 
  that might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional  
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items in 
  the following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug
     and Play devices so that you can use them immediately, without
     additional configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     access servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target 
  clients must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot 
  eXecution Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with 
  a remote-start floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate 
  partition for Remote Installation Services. For more information, 
  see "Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" 
  earlier in this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications on
  the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal emulator
  on the client. Each user sees an individual session, displayed as a
  Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by the server,
  independent of any other client session. If you install Terminal
  Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing on at least
  one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you install 
  Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued for 
  clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be 
  issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up 
  to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content 
  using Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
12.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. (For information about using other network adapters, read the
adapter documentation, and see "Taking an Optional Device Inventory"
earlier in this text file series.) Setup and the Configure Your Server
Wizard are designed to make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the
services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

12.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
static addressing, or both. You can view information about DHCP and IP
addressing in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called
   Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign
   IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

12.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

12.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
  the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
  are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
  e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required 
  in domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
  installed automatically when you create a domain controller 
  (or promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the 
  Whistler software detects that a DNS server already exists for that 
  domain. (Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component 
  to install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

12.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
  earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
  Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
  domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
  Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
  (For more information about different ways you can install 
  components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
  Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
  WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
  that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
  clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
13.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a single,
centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network
details. The information in this database is replicated automatically
among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain
controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You can
determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

13.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup, and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support. 

13.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

13.2   Additional Information About Domains

======================================================================
1.0   Preparing Your System for an Upgrade
======================================================================

This section describes the basic steps to prepare your
server for an upgrade.

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Whistler Help and Support Services for the 
operating system that you are running.

1.2   Reviewing Hardware and Software
======================================================================

When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process Setup carries
out is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along 
with the information in Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility 
section of Readme.doc (in the root directory of the Whistler CD), to 
determine whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or 
software before upgrading. If you use an Internet service provider 
(ISP), pay special attention to any recommendations about updating 
the ISP software necessary for your Internet connectivity.

1.3   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before upgrading, you should back up your current files. You can back 
up files to a disk, a tape drive, or another computer on your network.

1.4   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before upgrading to
Whistler. Do not upgrade to Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

1.5   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for Upgrade (Windows 
NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you are upgrading a computer from Windows NT 4.0 and it has a
mirror set, volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare
for the upgrade as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror.

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After the upgrade, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up
data as needed, and make use of the variety of volume options (such as
mirrored volumes) available with dynamic disks. For more information
about dynamic disks, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

1.6   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Preparing Your System for a New Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take in preparing your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Advanced Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read AdvSrv4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster Nodes."

2.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on your 
computer.

2.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you 
should back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or 
the current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up 
files to a variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard 
disks of other computers on the network.

2.3   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing
Whistler. Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

2.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a clean installation on a computer that
currently runs Windows NT 4.0, and it has a mirror set, volume set,
stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare for the installation 
as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror. 

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After installation is complete, you can make the disk dynamic,
restore backed-up data as needed, and make use of the variety of
volume options (such as mirrored volumes) available with dynamic
disks. For more information about dynamic disks, see Whistler
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

2.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series.

How you start Setup depends on whether you are upgrading or
performing a new installation, as described in the following sections.
Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs. Full online help (called Help and Support Services) is
available when the Configure Your Server Wizard appears. To open
Help and Support Services, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support.

3.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

3.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Advanced Server
CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at
http://www.microsoft.com/) lists only the devices for which drivers 
are included on the Whistler Advanced Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you through supplying the driver 
file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage 
controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

3.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

3.2   Starting Setup for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading to Whistler, you can start Setup from the CD
or from a network. For information about the versions of Windows from
which you can upgrade, see "Upgrading" earlier in this text file
series.

For information about starting Setup for a new installation,
see "Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer"
or "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series. For information about unattended Setup and other options
available when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
later in this text file series.

>>> To start an upgrade from the CD on a computer running Windows:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start an upgrade from a network:

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared 
     drive and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD"
and "Starting a New Installation from a Network," provide procedures 
for starting Setup for a new installation. For information about 
starting Setup for an upgrade, see the previous section.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

3.3.1   Starting a New Installation from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Whistler CD for running Setup, you have several options 
for starting Setup.

Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or 
MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the setup 
process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. The usual way 
to enable disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS is 
to use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the 
documentation for WINDOWS 3.x or MS-DOS. 

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running MS-DOS:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. At the command prompt, type

   d:

   where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type

   cd i386

4. Type

   winnt

5. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 3.x:

1. Using File Manager, change to the CD-ROM drive.

2. Change to the I386 folder.

3. Double-click Winnt.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 95, 
Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or 
Whistler:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD. This method applies only if you want to perform a new
installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform an
installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

>>> To start Setup and perform a new installation by starting an 
x86-based computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3.2   Starting a New Installation from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Find and run the appropriate file on the I386 folder of the CD
   or in the shared folder:

   * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

   * From a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
     Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler,
     run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
5.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions
automatically. Then, you run Setup from the command line; that is, you
run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for
unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system
that is running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   Entering Server Settings for a New Installation
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

6.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During a new installation, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to
create or specify a partition on which you want to install Whistler.
You can create a partition from the unpartitioned space available,
specify an existing partition, or delete an existing partition to
create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition. If
you specify any action that will cause information to be erased, you
will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions for New
Installations" earlier in this text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Performing a new installation of 
Whistler on a partition that contains another operating system will 
cause that operating system to be overwritten.

6.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

6.3   Personalizing Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

6.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in AdvSrv1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

6.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will be part of a domain and will use more than one operating system,
you must use a different computer name with each of the operating
systems installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT
when it is started with Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, it would
need to have a different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is
started with Whistler Advanced Server. This requirement also applies
to a computer that will start with either of two different installations of
Whistler.

6.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters, and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

6.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

6.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

6.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other protocols) 
during Setup, or you can select the Typical settings option and then 
make any necessary changes to your networking configuration after
installation, by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called Automatic Private
   IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP addresses.
   You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
   Setup and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
   static addressing, or both. To open Whistler Help and Support 
   Services (which includes information about DHCP and static IP 
   addresses), after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
   Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain, by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at
   least initially, as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS:

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

6.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Advanced Server and use 
Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration
tools are also available from Administrative Tools.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Advanced Server, you can use clustering to ensure that
users have constant access to important server-based resources. With
clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as
one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node
begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Mission 
critical applications and resources remain continuously available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer of
your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need
in order to use the hardware with Whistler Advanced Server.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several 
options. You can:

 * Upgrade the operating system on a cluster that is running
   Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For
   a description of the ways you can do this, see "Upgrading
   Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition"
   later in this text file. 

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server and install
   Cluster service at the same time. For important information
   about preparing for cluster installation, see "Installation on
   Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, in Whistler Help and Support Services. 
To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

For information about reinstalling clustering on one of the cluster 
nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes if you 
cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

If you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition to Whistler on cluster nodes, you cannot perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information about how to perform an upgrade from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, see "Upgrading Clusters 
From Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text
file series.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

2.1 How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Advanced Server with the following
software:

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Advanced Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Advanced
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: If your goal is to have more than two nodes in the cluster, 
you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the cluster storage. Add the 
third or fourth nodes after completing the rolling upgrade. For 
cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure the 
disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as dynamic 
disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as spanned 
volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
Rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on the other node. After the groups are
   moved, one node is idle, and the other node handles all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Advanced Server Setup to upgrade the paused node from
   Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see sections
   earlier in this text file.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Advanced
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restriction is as follows:

 * You can perform a rolling upgrade only if you are upgrading from
   Windows 2000 on the cluster nodes. You cannot perform a rolling
   upgrade if you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0,
   Enterprise Edition. For a description of the ways to upgrade
   from Windows NT 4.0, see "Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT
   Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text file
   series.

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. For a mixed-version
cluster to work, the different versions of the software running on
each node must be prepared to communicate with one another. This
requirement leads to several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade
process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new
resource types to prevent these resources from failing over to a
Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you
view the possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node
will not be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to
the list. If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase
of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources
will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade on a cluster running Windows NT.
Only clusters running Windows 2000 support rolling upgrades to
Whistler.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
-------------      ---------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported  during rolling upgrades.  For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file 
                   series.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Advanced Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources 
that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, 
as well as the product documentation that comes with the application 
or resource.

Note: You also cannot perform a rolling upgrade when upgrading from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For more information, see 
"Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" 
later in this text file. 

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However, with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
Cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text file, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.

======================================================================
3.0   Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition
======================================================================

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade directly from Windows NT Server
4.0, Enterprise Edition to Whistler. You instead have two options. You 
can maintain cluster availability by performing an upgrade to Windows 
2000 first, then to Whistler, or you can upgrade directly to Whistler. 
If you upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler, you cannot 
maintain cluster availability.

3.1   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 while Maintaining Cluster 
Availability
======================================================================

To maintain cluster availability when upgrading from Windows NT 4.0
to Whistler, you must first upgrade to Windows 2000.

>>> To perform an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 while maintaining 
cluster availability:

1. Perform a rolling upgrade on one node from Windows NT 4.0 to 
   Windows 2000 as documented in "To Perform a Rolling Upgrade" in the
   Windows 2000 documentation. However, do not repeat the process
   for the other nodes as documented in those instructions. 

Important: For step 1, be sure to follow the procedures in the Windows 
2000 documentation, not the Whistler procedures, as the procedures are 
different for each version.  

2. Perform an upgrade on all other nodes from Windows NT 4.0 to
   Whistler. For more information, see "Performing a Rolling
   Upgrade" earlier in this text file. Follow the instructions, 
   upgrading only Node 2, not Node 1. For general information about 
   Setup, review the sections earlier in this text file series.

3. Perform an upgrade on the Windows 2000 node from Windows 2000 to
   Whistler. 

3.2   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 While Not Maintaining Cluster
Availability
======================================================================

To upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler without the intermediate 
step of upgrading to Windows 2000, you must interrupt cluster 
availability. The steps you perform to upgrade while not maintaining 
cluster availability depend on the hardware you are using for your 
cluster: either a Fibre Channel bus or a SCSI bus.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler when using a 
Fibre Channel bus:

1. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

2. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

3. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

4. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

5. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

6. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make
   configuration changes such as configuring cluster disks as
   dynamic disks. For more information about the limitations of server 
   clusters, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

7. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

8. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
   Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

9. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
   system on that node.

   The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler When Using a 
SCSI Bus:

1. Review the appropriate instructions for making sure that the SCSI
   bus is terminated or for putting Y-cables or TriLink cables in
   place. These instructions are in Cluster Administrator Help in
   Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, in the Index under
   "nodes, disconnecting." If you have used an alternative set of
   instructions from the Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
   CD, in \Support\Books\Mscsadm5.doc, review these instructions. You 
   will carry out the instructions in a later step.

2. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

3. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

4. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

5. On Node 1, follow the appropriate instructions to make sure the
   SCSI bus is terminated, or that Y-cables or TriLink cables are
   in place. 

6. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one, or bring them to a 
   shut-down state appropriate to your method of termination.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

7. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

8. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make configuration 
   changes such as configuring cluster disks as dynamic disks. For 
   more information about the limitations of server clusters, see 
   Whistler Help and Support Services.

9. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

10. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
    Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster 
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

11. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
    system on that node.

    The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

======================================================================
4.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

4.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously.  
Each node of your cluster must be running Advanced Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

 * Cluster hardware and drivers.

   Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and other
   cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Advanced Server. To
   check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on the 
   Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
   up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
   Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 
   
   http://www.microsoft.com/
   
   You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fibre
   Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk
   adapter.
   
   Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
   cluster storage hardware with Whistler Advanced Server. (Drivers 
   are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

   Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
   installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
   be corrupted. If your cluster hardware includes a SCSI bus, be sure 
   to review carefully any instructions about termination of the SCSI 
   bus and configuration of SCSI IDs.
   
   To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
   problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.
   
 * Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

   In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
   adapter will carry.
   
   Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
   plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
   and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
   adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
   subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   -----------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

   Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
   purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
   whenever you are configuring the server.

 * Cluster IP address.

   Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
   DHCP for this address.

 * IP addressing for cluster nodes.

   Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
   Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You 
   can provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each 
   network adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP 
   addresses, the addresses for each linked pair of network adapters 
   (linked node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

   Note: if you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
   single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
   so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
   temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
   unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
   DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
   consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster 
   nodes. This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP 
   address.

 * Cluster name.

   Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This 
   is the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
   (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
   different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
   the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
   other cluster names on the domain.

 * Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

   Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in 
   the same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

 * Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
   service.

   To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
   each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
   those nodes.

 * Cluster service user account.

   Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the 
   name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
   will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
   installation.

   The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
   account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
   account also must have local administrative privileges on all of 
   the cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on 
   the account (follow your organization's policies for password 
   renewal).

 * Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
   and log files).

   You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
   for holding important cluster configuration information. This
   information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
   when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
   node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user data.

 * List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
   which you will install clustering.
   
   Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
   relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
   make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
   This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
   during cluster configuration.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
   formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
   not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned 
   volumes (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

4.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

4.2.1   Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the following steps while the cluster nodes are still
displaying BIOS or EFI configuration screens before starting the
operating system on the first cluster node.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure you understand and follow the
   manufacturer's instructions for termination of the SCSI bus.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure that each device on the shared
   bus (both SCSI controllers and hard disks) has a unique SCSI ID.
   If the SCSI controllers all default to the same ID (often it is
   SCSI ID 7), change one controller to a different SCSI ID such
   as SCSI ID 6. If there is more than one disk that will be on the
   shared SCSI bus, each disk must also have a unique SCSI ID. In
   addition, make sure that the bus is not configured to reset SCSI
   IDs automatically during startup (otherwise the IDs will change 
   from the settings you specify).

 * Ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from both
   cluster nodes (while remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration
   screens).

4.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

4.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service 
Are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

4.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Advanced Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Advanced Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Advanced Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then
   click Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

    Planning Your Microsoft Whistler Datacenter Server Installation
                     Release Notes, Part 2 of 4

======================================================================
6.0   Planning Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be
formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). A primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you 
can install the files needed to load an operating system, such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Datacenter Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Datacenter Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. 
This allows space for a variety of items, including optional
components, user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future
service packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other
items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server,
you can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. 

6.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (you should allow 2 GB of space, but you might need 
less, depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for 
the system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk.

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

6.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup. After Setup, 
you can modify the partitioning of the disk by using Disk Management.

During the installation process, Setup examines the hard disk to
determine its existing configuration and then offers the following
options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.

6.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Whistler Partitions
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of Whistler (including Whistler
Professional and any product in the Whistler Server family). If you
want to set up a computer this way, note the following:

 * It is not necessary to create multiple installations of 
   Whistler for insurance against startup difficulties resulting 
   from driver or disk problems. Whistler includes a variety of 
   disaster-recovery features, one of which is safe mode. When 
   started in safe mode, Whistler uses default settings and the 
   minimum number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even 
   if a new driver is causing a problem). Another recovery feature 
   is the Recovery Console, a command-line interface that you can 
   start from the Setup CD. After starting the Recovery Console 
   and logging on, you can perform tasks such as starting and stopping 
   services and accessing the local drive. For more information about
   disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you use Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
   containing multiple installations of Whistler, the encrypted
   files will not be readable between the different installations
   unless you take one of the following approaches. One approach is
   to ensure that all the installations are in the same domain and
   that the user of these installations has a roaming profile.
   Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation of 
  phone books that can be automatically updated from a central server. 
  In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes Simple 
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management 
  Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool for
  creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications can
  communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers that
  might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional 
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items 
  in the  following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug and Play devices 
     so that you can use them immediately, without additional 
     configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     gain access to servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target clients
  must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot eXecution
  Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with a remote-start
  floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate partition for
  Remote Installation Services. For more information, see "Disk
  Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" earlier in
  this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications 
  on the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal 
  emulator on the client. Each user sees an individual session, 
  displayed as a Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by 
  the server, independent of any other client session. If you 
  install Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server 
  Licensing on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer 
  on which you install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses 
  can be issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server 
  for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued 
  for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content using
  Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
8.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard are designed to 
make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows 
Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

8.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP,
static addressing, or both. For more information about DHCP and IP
addressing, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature
   called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically
   assign IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

8.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers 
on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required in 
domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
installed automatically when you create a domain controller (or 
promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the Whistler 
software detects that a DNS server already exists for that domain. 
(Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component to 
install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

8.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
---------------------------------------------

If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
(For more information about different ways you can install 
components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a 
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other 
network details. The information in this database is replicated 
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers 
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You 
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller, to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.2   Additional Information About Domains
======================================================================

For detailed information about domains, operations master roles, and
other domain-related topics, see Active Directory in Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after 
you install Whistler on your first server, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

For information about setting up multiple domains with structured 
relationships, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

After making the decisions outlined in this text file series, you'll
be ready to run Whistler Setup and, later, to use Configure Your
Server. Together, Setup and Configure Your Server help you get
your servers up and running quickly. To find out more about Configure
Your Server, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
click Help and Support.

======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Computers that run Whistler Datacenter Server must be on the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL). The HCL is on the Whistler CD, in the
Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-date list of supported 
hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List by visiting the 
Microsoft Web site at:

http://www.microsoft.com/

The requirements for systems on the Datacenter Server HCL include the
following:

 * 400 megahertz (MHz) Pentium or higher central processing unit 
   (CPU) for x86-based computers, and 800 MHz Pentium or higher for
   Itanium-based computers.

   * On x86-based computers, a maximum of 32 CPUs per computer 
     are supported.

   * On Itanium-based computers, a maximum of 64 CPUs per computer
     are supported.

 * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum.

   * On x86-based computers, maximum RAM is 64 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, maximum RAM is 128 GB.

 * A hard disk partition with enough free space to accommodate the
   setup process. The minimum amount of space required is
   approximately 2 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in the 
previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space 
used for the operating system (excluding user accounts) is usually 
less than the free space required for Setup, depending on the system 
components installed.

For additional information about planning the sizes of disk 
partitions, including information about creating a separate partition
for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning Disk Partitions" later
in this text file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL.

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup, 
familiarize yourself with the Readme.doc file found on the root 
directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. This file contains 
important usage information about hardware, networks, applications, 
and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for
Whistler Datacenter Server. For more information, see "System 
Requirements and Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file 
series.

======================================================================
3.0   Decisions Made During Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic choices available during
installation.

3.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
Concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

3.2   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the 
only file system recommended for Datacenter Server. It is also the 
only file system that supports Active Directory, which includes many
important features such as domains and domain-based security.

3.3   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

Before running Setup, you will need to review your disk partitions. A
partition divides a disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by one file system. Different partitions often have different
drive letters (for example, C and D). After running Setup, you can
modify the partitioning of the disk. For information about planning
the partitions for a new installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions"
later in this text file series.

3.4   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Datacenter Server. You can install these
components during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or
Remove Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components
for you according to the type of server you specify. For more
information about components, see "Choosing Components to Install"
later in this text file series.

3.5   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

3.6   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains" later in
this text file series.

======================================================================
4.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Datacenter Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license,
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

======================================================================
5.0 Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

5.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some the features included in NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
opportunity to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your files 
intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format the 
partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Datacenter Server, you can use clustering to ensure
that users have constant access to important server-based resources.
With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to 
users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another 
node begins to provide service (a process known as failover). 
Mission critical applications and resources remain continuously 
available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Datacenter Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer
of your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you
need in order to use the hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several options. You can:

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server and
   install Cluster service at the same time. For important
   information about preparing for cluster installation,
   see "Installation on Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help.

For more information about reinstalling clustering on one of the 
cluster nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.


======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file series. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes 
if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file series.

2.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with the following
hardware and software:

 * A cluster storage unit using Fibre Channel, not SCSI. Fibre
   Channel is the only type of cluster storage on the Hardware
   Compatibility List for Datacenter Server. (Note that SCSI can be
   used for a two-node cluster with Advanced Server, not Datacenter
   Server.) 

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Datacenter Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Datacenter
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file series.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on another node. After the groups are moved,
   one node is idle, and the other nodes handle all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Datacenter Server Setup to upgrade the paused node
   from Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see
   sections earlier in this text file series.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Datacenter
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
They involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run different versions
of the operating system. For a mixed-version cluster to work, the
different versions of the software running on each node must be
prepared to communicate with one another. This requirement leads to
several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new resource 
types to prevent these resources from failing over to a Windows 2000 
node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you view the 
possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node will not 
be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to the list. 
If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase of a 
rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources will 
not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
--------------     ------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported during rolling upgrades. For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file series.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, as well as the 
product documentation that comes with the application or resource.

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS 
resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file. 

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

   Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
   on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ 
resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text files, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file series.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.


======================================================================
3.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

3.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan 
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is  running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously. 
Each node of your cluster must be running Datacenter Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

* Cluster hardware and drivers.

  Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and 
  other cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Datacenter 
  Server. To check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on 
  The Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
  up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
  Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

  http://www.microsoft.com/

  You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fiber
  Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk 
  adapter.

  Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
  cluster storage hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server. (Drivers 
  are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

  Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
  installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
  be corrupted. 

  To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
  problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

* Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

  In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
  adapter will carry.

  Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
  plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
  and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
  adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
  subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   --------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).
3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
whenever you are configuring the server.

* Cluster IP address.

  Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
  DHCP for this address.

* IP addressing for cluster nodes.

  Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
  Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You can 
  provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each network 
  adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP addresses, the 
  addresses for each linked pair of network adapters (linked 
  node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

  Note: If you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
  single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
  so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
  temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
  unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
  DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
  consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster nodes. 
  This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP address.

* Cluster name.

  Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is 
  the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
  (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
  different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
  the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
  other cluster names on the domain.

* Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

  Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
  same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

* Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
  service.

  To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
  each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
  those nodes.

* Cluster service user account.

  Create or obtain Cluster service user account. This is the 
  name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
  will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
  installation.

  The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
  account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
  account also must have local administrative privileges on all of the
  cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the
  account (follow your organization's policies for password renewal).

* Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
  and log files).

  You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
  for holding important cluster configuration information. This
  information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
  when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
  node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

  The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should 
  use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user 
  data.

* List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
  which you will install clustering.

  Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
  relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
  make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
  This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
  during cluster configuration.

  Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
  cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
  formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
  not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned volumes 
  (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

3.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

3.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

While remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that
you can scan the bus and see the drives from all cluster nodes.

3.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service 
are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

3.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Datacenter Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Datacenter Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Datacenter Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then click 
Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

This part of the text file series explains how to set up Whistler
Datacenter Server. For background information that will help you make
appropriate choices during Setup, see the earlier sections of the text
file series.

In this section of the text file series:
1.0     Preparing Your System for Installation

6.0     Configuring Your Server


======================================================================
1.0   Preparing Your System for Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take to prepare your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Datacenter Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read Datactr4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster 
Nodes."

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Whistler Help and Support Services for 
the operating system on your computer.

1.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you install Whistler Datacenter Server, you should back up your 
current files, unless the computer has no files or the current 
operating system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a 
variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard disks of 
other computers on the network.

1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer," later in this text
file series.

After you start Setup, it works in several stages, prompting you for
information, copying files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server
configuration for your specific needs. Full online help (called Help
and Support Services) is available when the Configure Your Server
Wizard appears. To open Help and Support Services, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Datacenter
Server CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at 
http://www.microsoft.com) lists only the devices for which drivers are 
included on the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file 
to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

2.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the 
CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

2.2   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

You can start Setup from a CD or from a network.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

2.2.1   Starting from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Microsoft Whistler CD for running Setup, you have
several options for starting Setup.

>>> To start setup from the CD:

1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from the 
CD-ROM drive. Using this method, you can perform a new installation on 
A computer that does not have an operating system, although you can 
Also use this method on computers that have operating systems.

>>> To start Setup for a new installation by starting an x86-based 
computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

2.2.2   Starting Setup from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
Partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
   drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions 
automatically. Then, run Setup from the command line; that is, run 
Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for unattended 
Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system that is 
running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
5.0   Entering Server Settings During Installation
======================================================================

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

5.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During installation, you can create or specify a partition on which 
you want to install Whistler. You can create a partition from the 
unpartitioned space available, specify an existing partition, or 
delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk space 
for the Whistler partition. If you specify any action that will cause 
information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions" earlier in this 
text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Installing Whistler on a 
partition that contains another operating system will cause that 
operating system to be overwritten.

5.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

5.3   Personalizing Whistler Datacenter Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

5.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in Datactr1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

5.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 
2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name 
only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will contain multiple Whistler Datacenter Server installations, each
installation must be on a separate partition and must have a unique
computer name.

5.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

5.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

5.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

5.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other
protocols) during Setup, or you can use the Typical settings option 
and then make any necessary changes to your networking configuration 
after installation by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature called Automatic
   Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP
   addresses. You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses 
   automatically during Setup and then, after Setup, change your 
   configuration to use DHCP, static addressing, or both. To open 
   Whistler Help and Support Services (which includes information 
   about DHCP and static IP addresses), after completing Setup, click 
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at least initially, 
   as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS: 

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

5.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Datacenter Server and 
use Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard, you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration
tools are also available from Administrative Tools.

                     Release Notes for Setup
          Microsoft Whistler Professional for Intel Itanium Systems
                             Beta 2

**********************************************************************

        (c) 2001 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

When installing a new operating system, you need to make several
choices. The Whistler Setup Wizard and this document guide you through
these choices. You also learn how to connect your computer to a
network. 

	Important: Before you begin, you should also read the file
	Read1st.txt, which is on the Whistler Professional CD. This 
        file contains late-breaking information that was unavailable 
        when these release notes and Whistler Help were written,
	including preinstallation notes vital to the success of your 
	installation.

This document describes how to run the Whistler Setup Wizard and
install Whistler on a single computer.

======================================================================
CONTENTS
======================================================================

1.0   Before You Begin
2.0   Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium-based Computers
3.0   Starting an Itanium-based Computer for the First Time
4.0   Running the Whistler Setup Wizard 


======================================================================
1.0   Before You Begin
======================================================================

When you set up Whistler, you have to provide information 
about how you want to install the operating system. The procedures in 
these release notes help you to provide the necessary information. To 
ensure a successful installation, complete the following tasks, 
which are described in the sections that follow, before you install 
Whistler:

   * Make sure your hardware components meet the minimum requirements.

   * Obtain Whistler-compatible hardware and software, such as
     upgrade packs, new drivers, and so on.

   * Obtain network information.

1.1   Meeting Hardware Requirements
======================================================================

Before you install Whistler, make sure your computer meets the
following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 800 megahertz (MHz) Intel Itanium microprocessor

   * 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM

   * VGA monitor or better

   * Keyboard

   * Mouse or compatible pointing device

   * CD-ROM drive

For network installation:

   * Whistler-compatible network adapter card and related cable

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

To install Whistler automatically, you only need the Whistler
Professional for Intel Itanium systems CD. To create an Extensible 
Firmware Interface (EFI) partition, insert a floppy disk that contains 
the EFI FDISK and FORMAT tools. 

For more information about EFI utilities, see the documentation
supplied by your computer vendor.

1.2   Obtaining Network Information
======================================================================

If your computer won't be connected to a network, skip this
section.

First, you need to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you don't know which option to choose or if your
computer won't be connected to a network, select the Workgroup option.
(You can join a domain later after you install Whistler.) If you 
select the Domain option, ask your network administrator to create a 
new computer account in that domain or reset your existing account.

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request
the following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer

   * Name of the workgroup or domain

   * TCP/IP address (if your network doesn't have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during the setup process, you must have the
correct hardware installed on your computer and be connected by
network cable. 

======================================================================
2.0   Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium-based Computers
======================================================================

Itanium-based computers that use EFI have specific partitioning
requirements. The current EFI specification is capable of
understanding the FAT file system only. There must be one partition
that is formatted as a FAT partition. This partition is used to store
programs and information files that EFI uses to automatically start
Whistler.

The current recommended size of the FAT partition is no less than
100 megabytes (MB) and no more than 1 gigabyte (GB).


======================================================================
3.0   Starting an Itanium-based Computer for the First Time
======================================================================

When you first start an Itanium-based computer that does not have an
operating system installed, the computer starts and then stops at the
shell prompt. During startup, the EFI shell tries to identify file
systems that it recognizes and assigns drive mapping similar to
the MS-DOS-based drive letter assignment.

The drive mappings are listed as fs0, fs1, and so on. A list of all
recognized file systems and block-accessed hardware appears above
the shell prompt when you first start the computer. For example, a
drive mapping similar to the chart below might appear:

      fs0   : VenHw(Unknown Device:FF) /CDROM(Entry1)
      blk0  : VenHw(Unknown Device:01)
      blk1  : VenHw(Unknown Device:80)
      blk2  : VenHw(Unknown Device:FF) /CDROM(Entry1)

To change to a specific drive from the command prompt, type its
name followed by a colon. For example, to switch to the CD-ROM drive,
type:

      fs0:


======================================================================
4.0   Running the Whistler Setup Wizard
======================================================================

The installation process for Whistler systems is divided into two 
phases. The first phase is text-mode setup. The second phase is where 
the Whistler Setup Wizard gathers information such as regional 
settings, user names and passwords, and network information.

During text-mode setup, files are copied to the computer, and you are 
prompted to create partitions and to choose whether you want to
perform a manual or automatic installation. The Whistler Setup Wizard
then copies the appropriate files to your hard disk, checks the 
hardware, and configures your installation. When the installation is 
complete, you're ready to log on to Whistler. Note that your
computer restarts several times during the setup process.

4.1   Installing From the Whistler CD
======================================================================

>>> To install Whistler from the CD: 

   1. Turn on your computer and insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive.

   2. After approximately one minute, the EFI shell screen appears.

   3. When the shell prompt appears, type the following, and then
      press ENTER:

            fs0:

      The command prompt now reads fs0:\>. This is the CD-ROM drive.

      Note: If partitions on your hard disk already exist, the
      mapping for the CD-ROM might be different than the previous
      example. To locate the CD, look for the FS mapping that
      reads:

            CD-ROM

   4. At the fs0:\> prompt, type:

            SETUPLDR

      Text-mode setup for Whistler starts. 

   5. During text-mode setup, you are asked to create and delete
      partitions. You must create at least two partitions. One
      partition is for the operating system loader files; it must be a
      minimum of 100 MB and must be formatted as FAT.

      After creating the FAT partition, you can then create additional
      partitions for the operating system. The file system on these
      partitions can be FAT, FAT32, or NTFS.
   
   6. Whistler provides a choice of automatic or manual
      installations.

      An automatic installation configures the computer for you,
      requiring a minimum of direction. To perform an automatic
      installation, press ENTER.

      A manual installation prompts you to enter information during
      the setup process.

      If you want to configure the computer in a certain way, such as
      by using a specific network configuration, you should perform a
      manual installation. To perform a manual installation, press C.

   7. Text-mode setup continues and copies the necessary files to the
      hard disk. Once text-mode setup completes, the computer restarts
      automatically. If the computer stops responding after 
      restarting, turn off or reset the computer.

   8. When the computer restarts, GUI-mode setup starts automatically.
      If you selected a manual installation, you are prompted for
      additional information.

   9. Once GUI-mode setup is complete, the computer restarts
      automatically. 

4.2   Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

The Whistler Setup Wizard helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings on
the following wizard pages, depending on the configuration of your
computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to
     continue the setup process, select the option labeled I accept
     this agreement.

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Whistler installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations. You
     can set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional
     settings.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings for
     different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person to 
     whom this copy of Whistler is licensed and, optionally, the 
     organization.

   * Computer Name and Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain
     names on your network. The Whistler Setup Wizard suggests a
     computer name, but you can change the name.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you
     want Whistler to automatically adjust for daylight-savings time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you're an advanced user, select the
     Typical settings option for your network configuration. To
     manually configure network clients, services, and protocols,
     select the Custom settings.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must
     join either a workgroup or a domain.

     For more information, see "Providing Networking Information"
     later in this document.

   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who will
     be using your computer. Each person with an account on the
     computer can be assigned different levels of access.


4.3   Providing Networking Information
======================================================================

During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you won't be working on a network, select the option
to join a workgroup.

4.3.1   Joining a Workgroup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a peer-to-peer network). Any user can join a workgroup by
simply typing the workgroup name--you don't need special permissions
to join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup
name, or you can use the workgroup name that the Whistler Setup Wizard
suggests.

4.3.2   Joining a Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, while the
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network
administrator. Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself,
joining a domain requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must already have an
existing computer account in the domain you want to join. You are
prompted to type a new computer account name. Before you run the
Whistler Setup Wizard, ask your network administrator to create a
computer account. Or if you have the appropriate privileges, you can
create the account during the setup process and join the domain. To
join a domain, you need to provide your user name and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Whistler.

4.4   Logging on to Whistler
======================================================================

When you install Whistler, Setup prompts you to create a user account for yourself and one for each person who regularly uses the computer, whether in an office or home.

Important: The Administrator account is still active in Whistler, but you can only gain access to it when you are in safe mode. If you need to perform administrative-only tasks on your computer, such as managing accounts and resources, assign Administrator rights to your user account when you create it during Setup.

If you have Administrator rights, you can assign permissions to each user account. For example, you can determine whether a user may install software, view other users' documents, and operate network resources such as printers and servers. 

4.2   Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you're a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator rights.

>>> To create a user account: 

   1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

   2. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. 

   3. Double-click User Accounts. 

   4. Click Create a new account.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear.

After making the decisions outlined in this text file series, you'll
be ready to run Whistler Setup and, later, to use the Configure Your
Server Wizard. Together, Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard 
help you get your servers up and running quickly. To find out more 
about the Configure Your Server Wizard, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen
hardware that supports Whistler Advanced Server.

1.1   System Requirements
======================================================================

To ensure adequate performance, the computers on which you
will install Whistler Advanced Server must meet the following 
requirements:

 * Pentium or higher central processing unit (CPU). 

   * On x86-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 233 
     MHz, with a recommended speed of 550 MHz.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 
     800 MHz. 

 * A maximum of 8 CPUs per computer are supported.

 * RAM:

   * On x86-based computers, 256 MB of RAM is recommended, while the
     minimum amount of RAM required is 128 MB and the maximum is 
     32 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum amount of RAM required is
     1 GB. 

   For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, see the Hardware
   Compatibility List (HCL), described in "Hardware Compatibility"
   later in this text file series. 

 * Hard disk partition: the minimum amount of space required is 
   approximately 1 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the 
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than a new installation, because
     the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as
     a factor of ten during the upgrade as Active Directory
     functionality is added.

     Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in 
     The previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard 
     disk space used for the operating system (excluding user 
     accounts) is usually less than the free space required for Setup, 
     depending on the system components installed.

   For additional information about planning the sizes of disk
   partitions, including information about creating a separate 
   partition for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning 
   Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this text 
   file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL. The HCL is described in the following section,
   "Hardware Compatibility."

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the setup files.

1.2   Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Whistler Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and
reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful installation,
however, check to make sure your computer hardware is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server before running Setup.

To do this, see the Whistler Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). If
your hardware is not listed, Setup might not be successful. (Note that
one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.)

To see the version of the HCL that was released with Whistler, on the
Whistler CD, in the Support folder, open Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-
date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List 
by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/

In addition, check that you have updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based
computer) or Extensible Firmware Interface (for an Itanium-based
computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these
items. For more information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see
"Understanding ACPI BIOS" later in this text file series.

Finally, before installing Whistler Advanced Server, consider taking
a device inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more
information, see the following section.

1.3   Taking an Optional Device Inventory
======================================================================

To ensure smooth functioning of your adapters and other devices in
your computer, be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file series. For specific
information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI,
RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the
manufacturer, see "Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File"
later in this text file series.

Whistler includes Plug and Play technology so that devices (for
example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized
by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you
do not have to specify each device's settings by hand. However, if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your
Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards,
you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts.
This section describes the steps you can take, if you choose, to
understand your device configuration before running Setup.

To better understand the configuration of the devices in your
computer, take an inventory. To do this, if your computer has an
existing operating system, use it to obtain the current settings, such
as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices.
For example, with Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view
settings (on the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel,
and then double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also
choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen
while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when
prompted.

During Setup, Whistler automatically takes a device inventory as
well. However, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following
difficulties:

 * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
   Whistler might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent
   this, you can take one of two approaches.

   You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and 
   re-install it afterward. For more information about hardware and 
   configuration, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
   and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
   click Help and Support.

   Alternatively, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
   memory addresses before running Setup so that each adapter's
   settings are unique.

 * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
   Whistler to detect or enumerate them, Whistler might receive
   indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you
   might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and 
   re-install and configure them afterward. For more information 
   about hardware and for configuration guidance, see Whistler Help 
   and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
   completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather before
starting Setup.

ADAPTER               INFORMATION TO GATHER
-------------         -----------------------------------------------
Video                 Adapter or chip set type and how many video 
                      adapters

Network               IRQ, I/O address, DMA (if used), connector 
                      type (for example, BNC or twisted pair), 
                      and bus type

SCSI controller       Adapter model or chip set, IRQ, and bus type

Mouse                 Mouse type and port (COM1, COM2, bus, or PS/2) 
                      or USB

I/O port              IRQ, I/O address, and DMA (if used) for 
                      each I/O port

Sound adapter         IRQ, I/O address, and DMA

Universal serial      Devices and hubs attached
bus (USB)

External modem        Com port connections (COM1, COM2, and so on)

Internal modem        Com port connections; for nonstandard
                      configurations, IRQ and I/0 address

Advanced              Enabled or disabled; current setting
Configuration and     
Power Interface 
(ACPI); Power 
Options   
     
PCI                   What PCI adapters are inserted and in which
                      slots

1.3.1   Understanding ACPI BIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For x86-based computers, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a
set of software through which the operating system (or Setup)
communicates with the computer's hardware devices. The Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for
the way the BIOS works. Whistler supports not only ACPI-compliant BIOS
versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power
management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions that 
appear on your screen.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

 * For information about which ACPI-based BIOS versions are 
   ACPI-compliant, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for
   Whistler. This is the definitive source for this information.
   For information about the HCL, see "Hardware Compatibility"
   earlier in this text file series.

 * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
   restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
   particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
   "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

 * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, see your
   hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.


======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup,
familiarize yourself with important files found on the root directory
of the Whistler Advanced Server CD:

 * Read1st.txt  Contains critical preinstallation notes vital to the
                success of your installation.

 * Readme.doc   Contains important usage information about hardware,
                networks, applications, and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for Whistler
Advanced Server. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility"
earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
3.0   Deciding Whether to Upgrade or Install
======================================================================

After you have reviewed "System Requirements," "Hardware
Compatibility," and "Important Files to Review" earlier in this text
file series, and before you run Whistler Advanced Server Setup, you
will need to determine whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation. Upgrading is replacing a version of Windows NT or
Windows 2000 with Whistler Advanced Server. Installing, in contrast
to upgrading, means wiping out the previous operating system, or
installing Whistler Advanced Server on a disk or disk partition with
no previous operating system.

Note: Do not upgrade to or install Whistler on a compressed drive 
Unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression 
utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume before running 
Whistler Setup on it.

If you have already decided whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation, see the following sections later in this text file
series:

 * For an upgrade: see "Decisions to Make for an Upgrade."

 * For a new installation: see "Decisions to Make for a New
   Installation."

There are several reasons to choose to upgrade. (To determine whether
your old operating system is a version from which you can upgrade, see
the following section, "Upgrading.") Configuration is simpler, and 
your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are
retained. In addition, files and applications do not need to be 
re-installed. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, 
you should back up the disk before running Setup.

It is possible to install Whistler Advanced Server and also allow the
computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the
computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file
system issues. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this text file
series.

3.1   Upgrading
======================================================================

If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Whistler into the same
folder as the currently installed operating system. You can upgrade 
to Whistler Advanced Server from the following versions of Windows:

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition

 * Windows 2000 Server

 * Windows 2000 Advanced Server

If your computer is running Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, 
you can upgrade to Whistler Advanced Server, but not Whistler Server.

Note: If you are running a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0, you cannot upgrade directly to Whistler from it. You must first upgrade to Windows NT Server 4.0.

3.2   Installing
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a new installation, note that:

 * For a new installation on a disk partition that contains
   applications you want to keep, you must back up the applications 
   and re-install them after installing Whistler Advanced Server.

 * If you want to perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server on a partition that previously contained Whistler
   Advanced Server, and if you want to keep any documents saved in the 
   My Documents folder, back them up before beginning the 
   installation. You can use Search to find the documents. After 
   completing the new installation, you can copy the documents back to 
   the My Documents folder.


======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, and you have a Windows NT 4.0 domain, you will
need to decide on the order of server upgrades. For more information,
see the following sections later in this text file series:

 * "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers
   First"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers
   First"

In addition, if you are upgrading from Windows NT 4.0, you will need
to decide whether to convert the file system, on any FAT or FAT32
partitions you might have, to the NTFS file system. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.


======================================================================
5.0   Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

Domains are an important feature of Windows servers and clients. A
domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a single
domain name and security boundary. It is necessary to have one or more
domains if you want to use domain-based user accounts and other domain
security features in Whistler. (This was true for Windows NT and
Windows 2000 as well.) 

On computers running Whistler, servers can have one of three roles in 
relation to domains:

 * Domain controllers contain matching copies of the user accounts
   and other Active Directory data in a given domain.

 * Member servers belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the
   Active Directory data.

 * Stand-alone servers belong to a workgroup rather than a domain.

A domain must have at least one domain controller. For resilience, a
domain should have multiple domain controllers to support the handling
of logon requests and directory updates.

Before running Setup, you should plan the roles that your servers will 
Have within domains in Whistler. However, you can still adjust these 
roles after completing Setup.

There are a number of important points to remember about upgrading an
existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to run with Whistler:

 * You must use the NTFS file system on domain controllers. In
   addition, any servers that have any partition formatted with FAT
   or FAT32 will lack many security features. For example, on FAT
   or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by
   the permissions set on the share, not on individual files, and
   there is no software protection against local access to the
   partition.

 * If you want to upgrade a server and then use the same applications
   as before, be sure to read about application compatibility.

   One important source of application compatibility information is
   Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility section of Readme.doc 
   (in the root directory of the Whistler CD). For more information
   about these files, see "Important Files to Review" earlier in
   this text file series.

 * You can upgrade member servers before or after upgrading domain
   controllers. However, when you upgrade the domain controllers in
   a Windows NT domain to Whistler, you must upgrade the primary
   domain controller first.

 * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
   access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it before 
   the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a server is dependent 
   on domain controllers for user information and therefore should not 
   be "left behind" when domain controllers are upgraded. As an 
   alternative, you can weakendecrease the security permissions on 
   Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows 
   NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. 
   For more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
   Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

The roles of the servers in a domain are named somewhat differently
by computers running Whistler Advanced Server as compared with those 
running Windows NT. On computers running Windows NT, the possible 
roles were primary domain controller (limited to one per domain), 
backup domain controller, member server, or stand-alone server. 
Whistler has only one kind of domain controller (without a
"primary" or "backup" designation), and it includes the roles of
member server and stand-alone server. When you upgrade, Setup assigns
server roles as follows:

ROLE IN WINDOWS NT DOMAIN   ROLE IN WHISTLER DOMAIN
--------------------------  ---------------------------------------
Primary domain controller   Domain controller

Backup domain controller    Your choice of domain controller or
                            member server

Member server               Member server

Stand-alone server          Stand-alone server


5.1   Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

When planning the order of server upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
domain, there are two somewhat different approaches to choose between: 
upgrading the domain controllers first, or upgrading the member 
servers first. You can mix these approaches. However, if you have a 
Windows NT domain and you want to begin upgrading domain controllers, 
you must upgrade the primary domain controller first.

If you upgrade member servers first (without upgrading domain
controllers), a variety of features become available, but none that
require Active Directory. Once you begin upgrading domain controllers,
Active Directory features become available.

For additional information about planning the order of server
upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 domain, see the following:

The lists in "Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0
Domain Controllers" and "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain," later in this text file series, show the
features that are available with each approach to upgrading servers.

5.1.1   Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 Domain 
Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When Windows NT domain controllers are upgraded and begin
communicating on a network, all the features of Whistler become
available through these servers. Of these features, the Active
Directory features are listed in this section, and a number of other
features are listed in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Note: The features available when domain controllers are upgraded 
include not only the features in the following list, but also the 
features in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a 
Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Active Directory includes the following features:

 * Simplified management of network-resource information and user
   information.

 * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
   a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active
   Directory.

 * Security and authentication features, including support for
   Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer V3, and Transport Layer
   Security using X.509v3 certificates.

 * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
   simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
   devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
   they need. You can take advantage of synchronization support
   through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) and work with directory consolidation
   requirements specific to your applications.

 * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make 
   it easier to configure and manage applications and other 
   directory-enabled network components.

 * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
   scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
   technology and advanced replication techniques to speed
   performance.

 * Use of Internet standards, including access through LDAP and a 
   namespace based on the Domain Name System (DNS).

 * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful development
   environment.

 * Additional features.

5.1.2   Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows 
NT 4.0 Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The features in the following list are available when member servers
are upgraded in a Windows NT domain, regardless of whether domain
controllers have been upgraded. The features available when domain
controllers are upgraded include not only the features in the
following list, but also the features in the previous one.

 * Management tools:
   Microsoft Management Console
   Plug and Play
   Device Manager
   Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
   Support for universal serial bus
   Enhanced Backup utility

 * File system support: The version of NTFS in Whistler includes
   support for disk quotas, the ability to defragment directory
   structures, and compressed network I/O.

 * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and Windows
   Script Host.

 * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
   choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
   enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
   Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
   over an intranet or the Internet.

 * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
   support as compared to Windows NT.

 * Security: Encrypting file system.

5.2   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. If you are not sure which approach you want to take,
see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file series.

If you upgrade your Windows NT domain by upgrading the domain
controllers first, the upgrade has the following three stages:

 * Carrying out backups and other preparations so you can restore the
   previous installation if necessary.

 * Upgrading the primary domain controller. You must do this before
   upgrading any backup domain controllers.

 * Upgrading other servers in the domain.

This section describes the actions to take for these stages. For a
more in-depth discussion of planning the upgrade of domain
controllers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide." For information about what versions of 
Windows NT can be upgraded to Whistler Advanced Server, see 
"Upgrading" earlier in this text file series.

5.2.1   Backups and Other Preparations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your 
servers, you should back up each server before upgrading it. Also, be 
sure to review "Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this 
text file series.

In addition, to safeguard your existing network integrity, you might
consider removing a backup domain controller temporarily from a
network. To do this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a
backup domain controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the
user accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
cable. After upgrading your primary domain controller to Whistler (you
must upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
controller if needed. However, in the course of a successful upgrade,
you would not and could not promote the Windows NT backup domain
controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would continue
the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the disconnected server
and upgrading it.

Also, for any computer that will be a domain controller in the
Whistler domain, make sure that there is plenty of free space on the 
disk, beyond the space needed for the operating system itself. (For
information about the disk requirements for the operating system, see
"System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.) When Setup
upgrades the user accounts database from the format used by Windows NT
to the format used by Whistler Advanced Server, the database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten.

5.2.2   Upgrading Servers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first domain controller to be upgraded in a Windows NT domain
must be the primary domain controller. As you upgrade this server, you
will be given the choices of creating a new domain or a child domain,
and of creating a new forest or a domain tree in an existing forest.
For the upgrading of a domain of two to five servers (which is the
size of domains discussed in this text file series), create a new
domain and a new forest. For information about domain structures to
use with larger numbers of servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three important
items: the database containing user accounts and other Active
Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (SYSVOL) folder.
The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition (FAT,
FAT32, or NTFS). The database can expand by as much as a factor of ten
from the size it was in Windows NT, so allow plenty of room for it.
(Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The SYSVOL 
folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information about
NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System" later in
this text file series.)

After the primary domain controller is upgraded to a Whistler domain
controller, it will be fully backward-compatible. This means that the
domain controller appears as a Whistler domain controller to Whistler
servers and clients, but emulates a Windows NT 4.0 primary domain
controller to Windows NT 4.0 servers and clients.

After upgrading your primary domain controller and ensuring that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, upgrade any backup domain
controllers next. (If possible, it is best to begin the upgrades soon,
rather than allowing a long delay.) Also, if you are running a remote 
access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it
before the last domain controller is upgraded. A remote-access member
server is dependent on domain controllers for user information and
therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers are
upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security permissions
on Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows
NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. For
more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

Note: When the second domain controller is upgraded, it copies the 
first (formerly the primary) domain controller. Therefore, be sure 
that the first domain controller is running and available on the 
network as you upgrade the second. Similarly, be sure that at least 
one Whistler domain controller is available on the network when you 
upgrade the third, fourth, and any remaining Windows NT domain 
controllers.

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Start and test each server on the
network to ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction before
upgrading another backup domain controller.

When you have completely upgraded all domain controllers to Whistler
domain controllers, you have the option of changing the domain from
mixed mode (where Windows NT domain controllers can exist in the
domain) to native mode (where only Whistler domain controllers can
exist in the domain). This is an important decision, because you
cannot revert to mixed mode after changing to native mode.

For information about domain trees, mixed mode, native mode, or any
other item related to domains, see the topics under Active Directory 
in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support 
Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support. For information about performing upgrades in domains larger 
than two to five servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

5.3   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers 
First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. For information about the advantages and disadvantages of each
approach, see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT
4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

Note: If you have a remote access server that is a member server, and 
you have begun upgrading any domain controllers, be sure to read 
"Upgrading Servers" earlier in this text file series.

Before upgrading any server, be sure to back it up, and review 
"Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this text file series.

If you upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by upgrading member servers
first, you can upgrade one, a few, or all of the member servers at a
given time. Choose the order of the upgrades by considering which of
your servers would be most improved by the features in the Whistler
Server family. For information about the features available when
member servers are upgraded, see "Features Available with Upgrade of
Any Server in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
series.

After upgrading member servers in a domain, when you are ready to
upgrade domain controllers, follow the instructions in "Upgrading a
Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First" earlier
in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic decisions you will need to make
if you have decided to perform a new installation. Each area is
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. You will need 
to consider the following:

6.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

6.2   Whether You Want to Be Able to Choose Between Different 
Operating Systems Each Time You Start the Computer
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" later in this text file series.

6.3   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. You should 
use NTFS because it is the only file system that supports Active
Directory, which includes many important features such as domains and
domain-based security. However, it might be necessary to have a FAT or
FAT32 partition in situations where you must set up a computer so that
it sometimes runs Whistler and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or an
earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System" later in this text file series.

6.4   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a 
New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

If you are performing a new installation, you will need to review
your disk partitions before running Setup (for an upgrade, you will
use existing partitions). A partition divides a disk into one or more
areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). After running Setup, you can modify the partitioning of the disk.
For information about planning the partitions for a new installation,
see "Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this
text file series.

6.5   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Advanced Server. You can install these components
during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the Configure
Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components for you
according to the type of server you specify. For more information
about components, see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this
text file series.

6.6   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

6.7   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier
in this text file series and "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, 
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Advanced Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

======================================================================
1.0   Preparing Your System for an Upgrade
======================================================================

This section describes the basic steps to prepare your
server for an upgrade.

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Whistler Help and Support Services for the 
operating system that you are running.

1.2   Reviewing Hardware and Software
======================================================================

When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process Setup carries
out is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along 
with the information in Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility 
section of Readme.doc (in the root directory of the Whistler CD), to 
determine whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or 
software before upgrading. If you use an Internet service provider 
(ISP), pay special attention to any recommendations about updating 
the ISP software necessary for your Internet connectivity.

1.3   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before upgrading, you should back up your current files. You can back 
up files to a disk, a tape drive, or another computer on your network.

1.4   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before upgrading to
Whistler. Do not upgrade to Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

1.5   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for Upgrade (Windows 
NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you are upgrading a computer from Windows NT 4.0 and it has a
mirror set, volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare
for the upgrade as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror.

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After the upgrade, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up
data as needed, and make use of the variety of volume options (such as
mirrored volumes) available with dynamic disks. For more information
about dynamic disks, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

1.6   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Preparing Your System for a New Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take in preparing your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Advanced Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read AdvSrv4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster Nodes."

2.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on your 
computer.

2.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you 
should back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or 
the current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up 
files to a variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard 
disks of other computers on the network.

2.3   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing
Whistler. Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

2.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a clean installation on a computer that
currently runs Windows NT 4.0, and it has a mirror set, volume set,
stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare for the installation 
as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror. 

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After installation is complete, you can make the disk dynamic,
restore backed-up data as needed, and make use of the variety of
volume options (such as mirrored volumes) available with dynamic
disks. For more information about dynamic disks, see Whistler
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

2.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series.

How you start Setup depends on whether you are upgrading or
performing a new installation, as described in the following sections.
Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs. Full online help (called Help and Support Services) is
available when the Configure Your Server Wizard appears. To open
Help and Support Services, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support.

3.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

3.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Advanced Server
CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at
http://www.microsoft.com/) lists only the devices for which drivers 
are included on the Whistler Advanced Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you through supplying the driver 
file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage 
controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

3.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

3.2   Starting Setup for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading to Whistler, you can start Setup from the CD
or from a network. For information about the versions of Windows from
which you can upgrade, see "Upgrading" earlier in this text file
series.

For information about starting Setup for a new installation,
see "Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer"
or "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series. For information about unattended Setup and other options
available when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
later in this text file series.

>>> To start an upgrade from the CD on a computer running Windows:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start an upgrade from a network:

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared 
     drive and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD"
and "Starting a New Installation from a Network," provide procedures 
for starting Setup for a new installation. For information about 
starting Setup for an upgrade, see the previous section.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

3.3.1   Starting a New Installation from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Whistler CD for running Setup, you have several options 
for starting Setup.

Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or 
MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the setup 
process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. The usual way 
to enable disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS is 
to use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the 
documentation for WINDOWS 3.x or MS-DOS. 

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running MS-DOS:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. At the command prompt, type

   d:

   where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type

   cd i386

4. Type

   winnt

5. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 3.x:

1. Using File Manager, change to the CD-ROM drive.

2. Change to the I386 folder.

3. Double-click Winnt.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 95, 
Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or 
Whistler:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD. This method applies only if you want to perform a new
installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform an
installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

>>> To start Setup and perform a new installation by starting an 
x86-based computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3.2   Starting a New Installation from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Find and run the appropriate file on the I386 folder of the CD
   or in the shared folder:

   * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

   * From a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
     Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler,
     run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
5.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions
automatically. Then, you run Setup from the command line; that is, you
run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for
unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system
that is running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   Entering Server Settings for a New Installation
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

6.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During a new installation, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to
create or specify a partition on which you want to install Whistler.
You can create a partition from the unpartitioned space available,
specify an existing partition, or delete an existing partition to
create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition. If
you specify any action that will cause information to be erased, you
will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions for New
Installations" earlier in this text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Performing a new installation of 
Whistler on a partition that contains another operating system will 
cause that operating system to be overwritten.

6.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

6.3   Personalizing Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

6.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in AdvSrv1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

6.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will be part of a domain and will use more than one operating system,
you must use a different computer name with each of the operating
systems installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT
when it is started with Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, it would
need to have a different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is
started with Whistler Advanced Server. This requirement also applies
to a computer that will start with either of two different installations of
Whistler.

6.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters, and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

6.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

6.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

6.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other protocols) 
during Setup, or you can select the Typical settings option and then 
make any necessary changes to your networking configuration after
installation, by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called Automatic Private
   IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP addresses.
   You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
   Setup and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
   static addressing, or both. To open Whistler Help and Support 
   Services (which includes information about DHCP and static IP 
   addresses), after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
   Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain, by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at
   least initially, as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS:

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

6.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Advanced Server and use 
Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration
tools are also available from Administrative Tools.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Advanced Server, you can use clustering to ensure that
users have constant access to important server-based resources. With
clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as
one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node
begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Mission 
critical applications and resources remain continuously available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer of
your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need
in order to use the hardware with Whistler Advanced Server.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several 
options. You can:

 * Upgrade the operating system on a cluster that is running
   Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For
   a description of the ways you can do this, see "Upgrading
   Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition"
   later in this text file. 

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server and install
   Cluster service at the same time. For important information
   about preparing for cluster installation, see "Installation on
   Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, in Whistler Help and Support Services. 
To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

For information about reinstalling clustering on one of the cluster 
nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes if you 
cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

If you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition to Whistler on cluster nodes, you cannot perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information about how to perform an upgrade from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, see "Upgrading Clusters 
From Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text
file series.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

2.1 How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Advanced Server with the following
software:

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Advanced Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Advanced
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: If your goal is to have more than two nodes in the cluster, 
you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the cluster storage. Add the 
third or fourth nodes after completing the rolling upgrade. For 
cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure the 
disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as dynamic 
disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as spanned 
volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
Rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on the other node. After the groups are
   moved, one node is idle, and the other node handles all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Advanced Server Setup to upgrade the paused node from
   Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see sections
   earlier in this text file.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Advanced
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restriction is as follows:

 * You can perform a rolling upgrade only if you are upgrading from
   Windows 2000 on the cluster nodes. You cannot perform a rolling
   upgrade if you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0,
   Enterprise Edition. For a description of the ways to upgrade
   from Windows NT 4.0, see "Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT
   Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text file
   series.

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. For a mixed-version
cluster to work, the different versions of the software running on
each node must be prepared to communicate with one another. This
requirement leads to several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade
process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new
resource types to prevent these resources from failing over to a
Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you
view the possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node
will not be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to
the list. If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase
of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources
will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade on a cluster running Windows NT.
Only clusters running Windows 2000 support rolling upgrades to
Whistler.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
-------------      ---------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported  during rolling upgrades.  For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file 
                   series.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Advanced Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources 
that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, 
as well as the product documentation that comes with the application 
or resource.

Note: You also cannot perform a rolling upgrade when upgrading from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For more information, see 
"Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" 
later in this text file. 

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However, with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
Cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text file, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.

======================================================================
3.0   Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition
======================================================================

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade directly from Windows NT Server
4.0, Enterprise Edition to Whistler. You instead have two options. You 
can maintain cluster availability by performing an upgrade to Windows 
2000 first, then to Whistler, or you can upgrade directly to Whistler. 
If you upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler, you cannot 
maintain cluster availability.

3.1   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 while Maintaining Cluster 
Availability
======================================================================

To maintain cluster availability when upgrading from Windows NT 4.0
to Whistler, you must first upgrade to Windows 2000.

>>> To perform an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 while maintaining 
cluster availability:

1. Perform a rolling upgrade on one node from Windows NT 4.0 to 
   Windows 2000 as documented in "To Perform a Rolling Upgrade" in the
   Windows 2000 documentation. However, do not repeat the process
   for the other nodes as documented in those instructions. 

Important: For step 1, be sure to follow the procedures in the Windows 
2000 documentation, not the Whistler procedures, as the procedures are 
different for each version.  

2. Perform an upgrade on all other nodes from Windows NT 4.0 to
   Whistler. For more information, see "Performing a Rolling
   Upgrade" earlier in this text file. Follow the instructions, 
   upgrading only Node 2, not Node 1. For general information about 
   Setup, review the sections earlier in this text file series.

3. Perform an upgrade on the Windows 2000 node from Windows 2000 to
   Whistler. 

3.2   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 While Not Maintaining Cluster
Availability
======================================================================

To upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler without the intermediate 
step of upgrading to Windows 2000, you must interrupt cluster 
availability. The steps you perform to upgrade while not maintaining 
cluster availability depend on the hardware you are using for your 
cluster: either a Fibre Channel bus or a SCSI bus.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler when using a 
Fibre Channel bus:

1. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

2. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

3. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

4. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

5. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

6. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make
   configuration changes such as configuring cluster disks as
   dynamic disks. For more information about the limitations of server 
   clusters, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

7. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

8. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
   Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

9. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
   system on that node.

   The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler When Using a 
SCSI Bus:

1. Review the appropriate instructions for making sure that the SCSI
   bus is terminated or for putting Y-cables or TriLink cables in
   place. These instructions are in Cluster Administrator Help in
   Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, in the Index under
   "nodes, disconnecting." If you have used an alternative set of
   instructions from the Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
   CD, in \Support\Books\Mscsadm5.doc, review these instructions. You 
   will carry out the instructions in a later step.

2. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

3. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

4. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

5. On Node 1, follow the appropriate instructions to make sure the
   SCSI bus is terminated, or that Y-cables or TriLink cables are
   in place. 

6. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one, or bring them to a 
   shut-down state appropriate to your method of termination.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

7. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

8. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make configuration 
   changes such as configuring cluster disks as dynamic disks. For 
   more information about the limitations of server clusters, see 
   Whistler Help and Support Services.

9. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

10. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
    Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster 
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

11. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
    system on that node.

    The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

======================================================================
4.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

4.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously.  
Each node of your cluster must be running Advanced Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

 * Cluster hardware and drivers.

   Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and other
   cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Advanced Server. To
   check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on the 
   Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
   up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
   Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 
   
   http://www.microsoft.com/
   
   You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fibre
   Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk
   adapter.
   
   Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
   cluster storage hardware with Whistler Advanced Server. (Drivers 
   are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

   Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
   installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
   be corrupted. If your cluster hardware includes a SCSI bus, be sure 
   to review carefully any instructions about termination of the SCSI 
   bus and configuration of SCSI IDs.
   
   To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
   problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.
   
 * Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

   In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
   adapter will carry.
   
   Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
   plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
   and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
   adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
   subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   -----------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

   Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
   purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
   whenever you are configuring the server.

 * Cluster IP address.

   Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
   DHCP for this address.

 * IP addressing for cluster nodes.

   Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
   Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You 
   can provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each 
   network adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP 
   addresses, the addresses for each linked pair of network adapters 
   (linked node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

   Note: if you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
   single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
   so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
   temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
   unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
   DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
   consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster 
   nodes. This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP 
   address.

 * Cluster name.

   Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This 
   is the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
   (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
   different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
   the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
   other cluster names on the domain.

 * Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

   Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in 
   the same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

 * Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
   service.

   To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
   each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
   those nodes.

 * Cluster service user account.

   Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the 
   name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
   will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
   installation.

   The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
   account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
   account also must have local administrative privileges on all of 
   the cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on 
   the account (follow your organization's policies for password 
   renewal).

 * Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
   and log files).

   You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
   for holding important cluster configuration information. This
   information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
   when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
   node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user data.

 * List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
   which you will install clustering.
   
   Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
   relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
   make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
   This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
   during cluster configuration.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
   formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
   not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned 
   volumes (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

4.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

4.2.1   Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the following steps while the cluster nodes are still
displaying BIOS or EFI configuration screens before starting the
operating system on the first cluster node.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure you understand and follow the
   manufacturer's instructions for termination of the SCSI bus.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure that each device on the shared
   bus (both SCSI controllers and hard disks) has a unique SCSI ID.
   If the SCSI controllers all default to the same ID (often it is
   SCSI ID 7), change one controller to a different SCSI ID such
   as SCSI ID 6. If there is more than one disk that will be on the
   shared SCSI bus, each disk must also have a unique SCSI ID. In
   addition, make sure that the bus is not configured to reset SCSI
   IDs automatically during startup (otherwise the IDs will change 
   from the settings you specify).

 * Ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from both
   cluster nodes (while remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration
   screens).

4.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

4.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service 
Are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

4.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Advanced Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Advanced Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Advanced Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then
   click Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

     Planning Your Microsoft Whistler Advanced Server Installation
                     Release Notes, Part 2 of 4

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.


======================================================================
8.0   Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems each time you restart the computer. For example, you
could set up a server to run Whistler Advanced Server most of the time
but allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise 
Edition in order to support an older application. (However, to do this 
you would need to make specific file system choices and would probably 
need the latest released Service Pack, as described in "Multiple 
Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" and "Choosing a File 
System" later in this text file series.) During restart, you can 
select which of the two operating systems you want to run. (You can 
specify a default operating system that will run if no selection is 
made during the restart process.)

Important: If you set up a computer so that the installed operating systems include Whistler and any other operating system, you must 
Install Whistler in a separate partition on the computer. (A partition 
divides a disk into sections that function as separate units and
that can be formatted for use by a file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters, for example, C and
D). Installing Whistler in a separate partition ensures that it will
not overwrite crucial files used by the other operating system.

The reason for setting up a computer so that you can choose between
two or more operating systems at startup is that you can use
applications that run only with a particular operating system. There
are definite drawbacks to setting up a computer this way, however:
each operating system uses valuable disk space, and compatibility
issues, especially file system compatibility, can be complex. In
addition, you cannot use dynamic disks (a storage type available in
Whistler) with some operating systems. The only operating systems that
can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.

Note: If you are considering setting up a computer with more than one
operating system to ensure that you will always have a way to
start the computer (regardless of driver or disk problems), first
take into account the variety of disaster-recovery features
available in Whistler. One example of these features is safe mode,
in which Whistler restarts with default settings and the minimum
number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even if a new
driver is causing a problem). With this and a variety of other
disaster-recovery features, it is not necessary to maintain more
than one operating system as a safeguard against system problems.
Avoiding multiple operating systems means you also avoid 
file system compatibility issues and other drawbacks. For more
information about disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

Before deciding to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain MS-DOS and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system in a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system in the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it in two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT.

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 95 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT. (For Windows 95
   OSR2, the primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.)

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 95. 

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 98 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 98. 

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler:

 * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" 
   and "Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced
   Server" later in this text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 2000 and Whistler or that contain
multiple Whistler partitions:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * When installing Whistler on a partition, you can choose any
   product in the Whistler product family. For example, for a
   computer containing multiple Whistler partitions, you could
   install Whistler Advanced Server on one partition and Whistler
   Professional on another.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS), you must take
   certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be available
   from each of the installations. For more information,
   see "Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System"
   later in this text file series.

8.1   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
======================================================================

On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it supports
important features, including Active Directory and domain-based
security. With NTFS, however, you need to take file system
compatibility into account when considering whether to set up a
computer to contain more than one operating system, because the
version of NTFS in Windows 2000 and Whistler has new features in
addition to those in Windows NT. Files that use any new features will
be completely usable or readable only when the computer is started
with Windows 2000 or Whistler. For example, a file that uses the new
encryption feature won't be readable when the computer is started with
Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, which were
released before the encryption feature existed. For more information
about features that affect file accessibility with Whistler, see
"NTFS" later in this text file series.

Note: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT and 
Whistler, and you want to have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate
version of Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released
Service Pack. Using the latest Service Pack maximizes
compatibility between Windows NT 4.0 and the updated NTFS file
system used with Whistler Advanced Server. (Specifically, this
compatibility in file systems is provided by Service Pack 4 and
later Service Packs.) Even the latest Service Pack, however, does
not provide access to files using the new features in NTFS.
Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. On these computers, a
FAT partition containing the Windows NT 4.0 operating system
ensures that when started with Windows NT 4.0, the computer will
have access to needed files.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Whistler Advanced Server on an NTFS
partition, when that computer starts with Windows NT 3.51, the NTFS
partition will not be visible.

8.2   Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Before you set up a computer that contains Windows NT 4.0
and Whistler Advanced Server, review the following precautions:

 * If your only concern is ensuring that you can always start the
   computer, setting up the computer so that you can start it with
   different operating systems at different times is not necessary.
   For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
   Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
   file series.

 * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
   Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. For more
   information, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
   Compatibility" earlier in this text file series.

 * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
   released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
   Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server (as opposed to an upgrade), by default, the installation
   is placed on a partition on which no other operating system is
   located. You can specify a different partition during Setup.

 * Don't install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the drive was
   compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation.

For more information about computers that contain multiple operating
systems, see the Windows 2000 Resource Kits.

8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System
======================================================================

If you set up a server so that it contains Windows 2000 and Whistler
or contains multiple Whistler partitions, and you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain
steps. These steps make encrypted files readable between the different
installations.

 * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
   same domain and that the user of these installations has a
   roaming profile.

 * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

There is one situation in which you might want to choose FAT or FAT32
as your file system. If it is necessary to have a computer that will
sometimes run Whistler and sometimes run Windows NT or an earlier
operating system, you will need to have a FAT or FAT32 partition as
the primary (or startup) partition on the hard disk. This is because
these earlier operating systems, with one exception, can't access a
partition if it uses the latest version of NTFS. The one exception is
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later, which has access
to partitions with the latest version of NTFS, but with some
limitations. Windows NT 4.0 cannot access files that have been stored
using NTFS features that did not exist when Windows NT 4.0 was
released. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
Contain More Than One Operating System" and "Multiple Operating
Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
series.

For anything other than a situation with multiple operating systems,
however, the recommended file system is NTFS.

The following list describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems. 

 * NTFS: A computer running Windows 2000 or Whistler can access files
   on an NTFS partition. A computer running Windows NT 4.0 with
   Service Pack 4 or later might be able to access some files.
   Other operating systems allow no access.

 * FAT: Access is available through MS-DOS, all versions of Windows,
   Windows NT, Whistler, and OS/2.

 * FAT32: Access is available only through Windows 95 OSR2, 
   Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Whistler.

The following list compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.

 * NTFS: Recommended minimum volume size is approximately 10 MB.
   Recommended practical maximum for volumes is 2 TB (terabytes). Much
   larger sizes are possible.
   Cannot be used on floppy disks.
   File size limited only by size of volume.

 * FAT: Volumes from floppy disk size up to 4 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 2 GB.

 * FAT32: Volumes from 512 MB to 2 TB.
   In Whistler, you can format a FAT32 volume only up to 32 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 4 GB.

Note: If you choose to format a partition as FAT during Setup and the
partition is larger than 2 GB, Setup will automatically format it
as FAT32.

9.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some of the features you can use when you choose NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory, and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in Whistler.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
choice of whether to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your 
files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format 
the partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.


======================================================================
10.0   Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations
======================================================================

You will need to plan your disk partitions before running Setup only
if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. Disk
partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a
disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by a file system such as FAT or NTFS. Different partitions
often have different drive letters (for example, C and D). A
primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you can
install the files needed to load an operating system such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
(Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.)

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Advanced Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Advanced Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. This 
allows space for a variety of items, including optional components, 
user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future service 
packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you
can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. (Note that you cannot use dynamic disks on some computers
that contain multiple operating systems. The only operating systems
that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.)

Important: If you're setting up a computer so that it contains multiple operating systems, you must install Whistler on its own 
partition. This ensures that Whistler will not overwrite crucial files 
needed by the other operating system. For more information, see 
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating 
System" earlier in this text file series.

10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (2 GB of space is recommended, but you might need less,
depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for the
system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk. (However, you cannot use dynamic disks on
some computers that contain multiple operating systems. The only
operating systems that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and
Whistler.)

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.


======================================================================
11.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

The following list describes the components in the preceding table 
and all other components that you can install.

Accessories and Utilities
  Includes desktop accessories such as WordPad, Paint, Calculator, 
  and CD Player, as well as the Accessibility Wizard. To select 
  individual items, in the Windows Components Wizard, select 
  Accessories and Utilities, click Details, and then select the 
  subcomponents you want from the list.

Certificate Services
  Provides security and authentication support, including secure 
  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), File
  Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation 
  of phone books that can be automatically updated from a central 
  server. In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes 
  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows 
  Management Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool 
  for creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications 
  can communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers 
  that might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional  
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items in 
  the following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug
     and Play devices so that you can use them immediately, without
     additional configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     access servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target 
  clients must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot 
  eXecution Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with 
  a remote-start floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate 
  partition for Remote Installation Services. For more information, 
  see "Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" 
  earlier in this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications on
  the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal emulator
  on the client. Each user sees an individual session, displayed as a
  Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by the server,
  independent of any other client session. If you install Terminal
  Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing on at least
  one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you install 
  Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued for 
  clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be 
  issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up 
  to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content 
  using Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
12.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. (For information about using other network adapters, read the
adapter documentation, and see "Taking an Optional Device Inventory"
earlier in this text file series.) Setup and the Configure Your Server
Wizard are designed to make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the
services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

12.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
static addressing, or both. You can view information about DHCP and IP
addressing in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called
   Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign
   IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

12.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

12.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
  the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
  are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
  e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required 
  in domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
  installed automatically when you create a domain controller 
  (or promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the 
  Whistler software detects that a DNS server already exists for that 
  domain. (Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component 
  to install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

12.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
  earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
  Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
  domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
  Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
  (For more information about different ways you can install 
  components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
  Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
  WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
  that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
  clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
13.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a single,
centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network
details. The information in this database is replicated automatically
among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain
controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You can
determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

13.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup, and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support. 

13.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

13.2   Additional Information About Domains
======================================================================

For information about upgrading a Windows NT domain, see "Upgrading
an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

For detailed information about domains, operations master roles, and
other domain-related topics, see Active Directory in Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after you install 
(or upgrade to) Whistler on your first server, click Start, and then 
click Help and Support.

For information about setting up multiple domains with structured
relationships, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

======================================================================
6.0   Planning Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be
formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). A primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you 
can install the files needed to load an operating system, such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Datacenter Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Datacenter Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. 
This allows space for a variety of items, including optional
components, user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future
service packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other
items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server,
you can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. 

6.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (you should allow 2 GB of space, but you might need 
less, depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for 
the system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk.

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

6.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup. After Setup, 
you can modify the partitioning of the disk by using Disk Management.

During the installation process, Setup examines the hard disk to
determine its existing configuration and then offers the following
options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.

6.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Whistler Partitions
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of Whistler (including Whistler
Professional and any product in the Whistler Server family). If you
want to set up a computer this way, note the following:

 * It is not necessary to create multiple installations of 
   Whistler for insurance against startup difficulties resulting 
   from driver or disk problems. Whistler includes a variety of 
   disaster-recovery features, one of which is safe mode. When 
   started in safe mode, Whistler uses default settings and the 
   minimum number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even 
   if a new driver is causing a problem). Another recovery feature 
   is the Recovery Console, a command-line interface that you can 
   start from the Setup CD. After starting the Recovery Console 
   and logging on, you can perform tasks such as starting and stopping 
   services and accessing the local drive. For more information about
   disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you use Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
   containing multiple installations of Whistler, the encrypted
   files will not be readable between the different installations
   unless you take one of the following approaches. One approach is
   to ensure that all the installations are in the same domain and
   that the user of these installations has a roaming profile.
   Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The

The following list describes the components in the preceding table 
and all other components that you can install.

Accessories and Utilities
  Includes desktop accessories such as WordPad, Paint, Calculator, 
  and CD Player, as well as the Accessibility Wizard. To select 
  individual items, in the Windows Components Wizard, select 
  Accessories and Utilities, and then select the subcomponents you 
  want from the list.

Certificate Services
  Provides security and authentication support, including secure 
  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation of 
  phone books that can be automatically updated from a central server. 
  In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes Simple 
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management 
  Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool for
  creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications can
  communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers that
  might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional 
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items 
  in the  following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug and Play devices 
     so that you can use them immediately, without additional 
     configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     gain access to servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target clients
  must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot eXecution
  Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with a remote-start
  floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate partition for
  Remote Installation Services. For more information, see "Disk
  Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" earlier in
  this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications 
  on the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal 
  emulator on the client. Each user sees an individual session, 
  displayed as a Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by 
  the server, independent of any other client session. If you 
  install Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server 
  Licensing on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer 
  on which you install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses 
  can be issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server 
  for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued 
  for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content using
  Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
8.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard are designed to 
make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows 
Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

8.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP,
static addressing, or both. For more information about DHCP and IP
addressing, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature
   called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically
   assign IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

8.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers 
on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required in 
domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
installed automatically when you create a domain controller (or 
promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the Whistler 
software detects that a DNS server already exists for that domain. 
(Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component to 
install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

8.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
---------------------------------------------

If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
(For more information about different ways you can install 
components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a 
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other 
network details. The information in this database is replicated 
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers 
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You 
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller, to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.2   Additional Information About Domains
======================================================================

For detailed information about domains, operations master roles, and
other domain-related topics, see Active Directory in Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after 
you install Whistler on your first server, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

For information about setting up multiple domains with structured 
relationships, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

Server. Together, Setup and Configure Your Server help you get
your servers up and running quickly. To find out more about Configure
Your Server, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
click Help and Support.

======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Computers that run Whistler Datacenter Server must be on the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL). The HCL is on the Whistler CD, in the
Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-date list of supported 
hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List by visiting the 
Microsoft Web site at:

http://www.microsoft.com/

The requirements for systems on the Datacenter Server HCL include the
following:

 * 400 megahertz (MHz) Pentium or higher central processing unit 
   (CPU) for x86-based computers, and 800 MHz Pentium or higher for
   Itanium-based computers.

   * On x86-based computers, a maximum of 32 CPUs per computer 
     are supported.

   * On Itanium-based computers, a maximum of 64 CPUs per computer
     are supported.

 * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum.

   * On x86-based computers, maximum RAM is 64 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, maximum RAM is 128 GB.

 * A hard disk partition with enough free space to accommodate the
   setup process. The minimum amount of space required is
   approximately 2 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in the 
previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space 
used for the operating system (excluding user accounts) is usually 
less than the free space required for Setup, depending on the system 
components installed.

For additional information about planning the sizes of disk 
partitions, including information about creating a separate partition
for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning Disk Partitions" later
in this text file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL.

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup, 
familiarize yourself with the Readme.doc file found on the root 
directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. This file contains 
important usage information about hardware, networks, applications, 
and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for
Whistler Datacenter Server. For more information, see "System 
Requirements and Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file 
series.

======================================================================
3.0   Decisions Made During Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic choices available during
installation.

3.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
Concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

3.2   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the 
only file system recommended for Datacenter Server. It is also the 
only file system that supports Active Directory, which includes many
important features such as domains and domain-based security.

3.3   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

Before running Setup, you will need to review your disk partitions. A
partition divides a disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by one file system. Different partitions often have different
drive letters (for example, C and D). After running Setup, you can
modify the partitioning of the disk. For information about planning
the partitions for a new installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions"
later in this text file series.

3.4   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Datacenter Server. You can install these
components during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or
Remove Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components
for you according to the type of server you specify. For more
information about components, see "Choosing Components to Install"
later in this text file series.

3.5   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

3.6   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains" later in
this text file series.

======================================================================
4.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Datacenter Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license,
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

======================================================================
5.0 Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

5.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some the features included in NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
opportunity to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your files 
intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format the 
partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

This part of the text file series explains how to set up Whistler
Datacenter Server. For background information that will help you make
appropriate choices during Setup, see the earlier sections of the text
file series.

In this section of the text file series:
1.0     Preparing Your System for Installation
2.0     Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
3.0     Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
4.0     Planning for Unattended Setup
5.0     Entering Server Settings During Installation
6.0     Configuring Your Server


======================================================================
1.0   Preparing Your System for Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take to prepare your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Datacenter Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read Datactr4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster 
Nodes."

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Whistler Help and Support Services for 
the operating system on your computer.

1.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you install Whistler Datacenter Server, you should back up your 
current files, unless the computer has no files or the current 
operating system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a 
variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard disks of 
other computers on the network.

1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer," later in this text
file series.

After you start Setup, it works in several stages, prompting you for
information, copying files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server
configuration for your specific needs. Full online help (called Help
and Support Services) is available when the Configure Your Server
Wizard appears. To open Help and Support Services, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Datacenter
Server CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at 
http://www.microsoft.com) lists only the devices for which drivers are 
included on the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file 
to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

2.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the 
CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

2.2   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

You can start Setup from a CD or from a network.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

2.2.1   Starting from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Microsoft Whistler CD for running Setup, you have
several options for starting Setup.

>>> To start setup from the CD:

1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from the 
CD-ROM drive. Using this method, you can perform a new installation on 
A computer that does not have an operating system, although you can 
Also use this method on computers that have operating systems.

>>> To start Setup for a new installation by starting an x86-based 
computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

2.2.2   Starting Setup from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
Partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
   drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions 
automatically. Then, run Setup from the command line; that is, run 
Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for unattended 
Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system that is 
running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
5.0   Entering Server Settings During Installation
======================================================================

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

5.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During installation, you can create or specify a partition on which 
you want to install Whistler. You can create a partition from the 
unpartitioned space available, specify an existing partition, or 
delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk space 
for the Whistler partition. If you specify any action that will cause 
information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions" earlier in this 
text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Installing Whistler on a 
partition that contains another operating system will cause that 
operating system to be overwritten.

5.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

5.3   Personalizing Whistler Datacenter Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

5.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in Datactr1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

5.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 
2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name 
only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will contain multiple Whistler Datacenter Server installations, each
installation must be on a separate partition and must have a unique
computer name.

5.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

5.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

5.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

5.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other
protocols) during Setup, or you can use the Typical settings option 
and then make any necessary changes to your networking configuration 
after installation by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature called Automatic
   Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP
   addresses. You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses 
   automatically during Setup and then, after Setup, change your 
   configuration to use DHCP, static addressing, or both. To open 
   Whistler Help and Support Services (which includes information 
   about DHCP and static IP addresses), after completing Setup, click 
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at least initially, 
   as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS: 

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

5.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Datacenter Server and 
use Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard, you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

3.0   Providing Feedback on Upgrades to Whistler Beta 2
======================================================================

Thank you for participating in the beta test for Whistler. In order to
make your testing as productive as possible, we have compiled a few
guidelines on the scenarios Microsoft is most interested in receiving
feedback on and some known issues with certain upgrade scenarios.

The Whistler development team would like the most feedback on the
upgrade path from Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows
Millennium Edition. Because Whistler is the first consumer version of
Windows based on Windows NT Technology, improving the upgrade
experience from those operating systems is crucial. In addition, you
should test clean installations. Upgrades from Windows 2000 are also
encouraged, but there are some scenarios that might have issues. 

======================================================================
4.0   System Requirements for Installation 
======================================================================

For the full list of system requirements, see the Setup text file
series for your operating system located in the \Setuptxt folder on
your Whistler CD.

======================================================================
5.0   Preinstallation Notes 
======================================================================

Before you install Whistler Beta 2 on your computer, be sure to read
this section. This section contains information about issues that
affect the installation process. By using this information to perform
your installation, you can ensure that the installation process
proceeds smoothly and that Whistler functions correctly.

5.1   Preinstallation Notes for Both 32-Bit and 64-Bit Editions
======================================================================

5.1.1   Whistler Product Keys: Important Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Keys

Product keys are required in the Beta 2 releases of Whistler Personal,
Whistler Professional, Whistler Server, and Whistler Advanced Server.
You must enter the product key during Setup to complete the
installation. This applies to all languages and versions available
through pre-release distribution programs, including both 32-bit and
64-bit versions. Product keys are 25-character alphanumeric strings
that are formatted in groups of five characters, separated by dashes.
It is very important that you manage your keys for Whistler Beta 2
carefully. Please read the details about this release later in this
section. 

Obtaining Product Keys

Product keys are distributed in various ways, depending on the
specific program. Technical beta testers must obtain keys from the
Windows Beta Web site by using their Beta ID and password. For more
information, see the Windows Beta Web site at:

http://windowsbeta.microsoft.com/

Other programs distribute keys directly with the installation media by
using stickers affixed to the media sleeve.

Key and Media Types

There is one single type of Product Key for Whistler Beta 2. At the
final release, Whistler will employ three primary key types: standard
keys, volume license keys, and OEM keys. There will be three
corresponding media types. Keys might also differ by platform
type (For example, Professional, Server, and so on).

Importance of Careful Key Management

You must take great care of your Product Keys for Whistler Beta 2. In
particular, you must use only the assigned keys for your media. If you
attempt to use keys from other products, beta programs, or the wrong
media type, your installation will fail. If you attempt to use an
incorrect product key, you might not be aware that installation failed
until after Setup is complete and you attempt to start your computer.
(This issue will be addressed when the final released versions of keys
are implemented.)

What is Windows Product Activation?

Windows Product Activation (WPA) is new for Whistler Beta 2 and is
described later in this section. It imposes additional constraints on
the use of Product Keys. In particular, each Product Key can only be
used to install a certain number of unique computers (the actual
number depends on the pre-release distribution program with which you
are participating). If you have received more than one Product Key
through your program, it is essential that you keep track of which
Product Key you use to install each Whistler operating system. 

Automating Product Key Entry

You can automate the installation of Product Keys through the use of
the ProductKey parameter in your unattend files. ProductKey is a new
name for the ProductID parameter that was supported in Windows 2000.
ProductKey functions identically to ProductID parameter. Please refer
to the unattend documentation for further information. When upgrading
Whistler using winnt32 /unattend, Whistler beta versions attempt to
use a previous Product Key if the computer you are upgrading from had
one installed already. This speeds up upgrades from older interim
versions (starting with Build 2428) to Beta 2 and subsequently to
later interim versions (or even re-installing the same version).
However, if you are upgrading from Build 2428 or earlier of the
operating system, you should take care to not install using
winnt32 /unattend in order to prevent possible key conflicts. 

Scripting Product Key Changes

It is not possible to script re-entry of Product Keys in Whistler
Beta 2. A new Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider will
be implemented in a later release. This provider will permit changing
a computer's Product Key through scripting interfaces.

Windows Product Activation

Whistler Beta 2 includes a new feature called Windows Product
Activation (WPA). WPA requires that you activate your product with
Microsoft within 14 days of initial installation. This activation
grace period, which will change to 30 days for the released product,
was chosen to enable us to thoroughly test the WPA feature during the
pre-release or Beta program. Activation, which is mandatory, is
anonymous. It couples the owner's Product Key with a computer hardware
ID that is non-unique and cannot be traced back to a given computer.
Activation is not the same as registration, nor does it require
registration. Registration refers to the voluntary provision of
customer information to Microsoft. Activation is implemented on all
32-bit platforms for standard media. It is required for all language
versions of Whistler. This excludes Volume and OEM media types.

Activating a Computer

Activation is required for each individual computer on which Whistler
Beta 2 is installed. Computers can be activated either online by using
an Internet connection, or manually, by telephoning a Microsoft
product activation call center. Call centers will be available
internationally for Whistler Beta 2, but they will only be available
during regional business hours until final product release The final
list of phone numbers, countries with toll free phone numbers, and
operating hours is still being completed. Call center availability
will be expanded significantly for the final product release.

For most installations, you will be asked to activate (and optionally
register) your system through the Setup program (full screen out-o
f-box experience (OOBE)). You can choose to defer activation until a
later time. In some cases, for example, if your video does not support
at least 800x600 modes, you will not see the initial activation
screens and deferral will be automatic. Server installations will also
automatically defer activation, since they do not utilize full screen
OOBE. If activation is deferred for any reason, you can activate at
any time. You must have local administrator privileges to activate. 

To activate, click Start, and then click Activate Windows. Or, if you
can't find it there for any reason, click Start, point to Programs,
point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Activate
Windows. You can also start activation while logging on to your
computer or through the notification (balloon) reminders, which become
more frequent the closer you get to expiration date. Online activation
(and registration, if selected) uses standard HTTPS to gain access to
the Internet. As long as the user account is able to browse to secure
Web sites (For example, home banking Web sites), then you can activate
the computer. 

>>> To complete activation, you must do one of the following:

   * Use your Internet connection such as a LAN network 
     connection or an Internet connection through an Internet Service 
     Provider, or
   * Use a modem that can connect to the Internet, or
   * Call a Microsoft product activation call center.

Activating Through a Proxy

If the computer you are trying to activate is on a network that uses a
proxy server to get to the Internet, and if your network implements
the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocols (used to detect proxy
settings automatically), you should be able to activate without
additional configuration. Otherwise, activation during the initial
Setup OOBE is deferred and you must configure the proxy settings in
Internet Explorer or through Control Panel. Since proxy settings are
set per user, be sure to do this using the same logged-on
account (with administrative privileges) that you will use to
activate. If your activation grace period expires before you set the
proxy on a local administrator account, you will need to start your
computer in non-networked safe mode in order to set up the proxy. You
will not be able to activate until you restart your system. You must
then log on as an administrator in order to activate.

Automating Activation

You can automate activation by using the AutoActivate parameter in
your unattend files. You can also set proxy settings for activation by
using the ActivateProxy parameter. Please refer to the unattend
documentation for further information. 

Image Deployment

The Sysprep tool has been enhanced to support activation rollback up
to three times. This is designed to deploy imaged systems using
standard media. You must still enter a unique Product Key for each
cloned image. You should create your master image as usual. Do not
activate this master system. After you have run Sysprep.exe and the
system shuts down, you can image the hard drive as needed at any
future time. This process can be repeated on multiple times, as long
as cumulative rollbacks do not exceed the limit listed earlier.

Scripting Activation

Activation scripting is not available in Whistler Beta 2. It will be
provided through WMI provider methods in a later release. By using
WMI, you can query various activation-related properties and then
activate by using both online and offline methods.

5.1.2   Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On computers running Whistler Professional, Whistler Server, Whistler
Advanced Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, the Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) command line tool installs when you initially
start WMI command line tool by compiling the Managed Object Format
(MOF) alias files. The installation might take approximately one
minute. Approximately 10 MB of free hard disk memory is required for
the installation. Your computer should function correctly with the WMI
command line tool installed. This issue will be addressed in a future
release.

5.1.3   Text-Mode Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On all versions of Whistler, if you choose to repair an existing
Whistler installation when running Setup from the Whistler CD, you
will be prompted for the normal Setup questions instead of going
through the process unattended. This issue will be addressed in a
future release.

5.1.4   Text-Mode Setup - Dynamic Disk Information
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you have a mix of basic and dynamic disks on a computer where you
are installing Whistler, the text-mode partitioning options screen can
misrepresent free space and type of partition. In particular, areas of
free space on the drive might be shown as partitioned dynamic disks
and dynamic disks might not show accurate amounts of available free
space. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

5.1.5   Setup - Installing Multiple Identical Disks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you attempt to install any version of Whistler on a computer with
multiple identical hard drives, Setup might not differentiate between
them and Setup fails. The message displayed is: "Setup either detected
multiple disks in your machine that are indistinguishable or detected
raw disk(s)." To work around this issue, remove one of the drives
using the BIOS or physically remove the disk from the system to allow
setup to continue. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

5.1.6   Setup/Upgrade: NetWare Client
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Setupdll.dll code was removed from Whistler Professional, Whistler
Server, Whistler Advanced Server, and Whistler Datacenter Server. As a
result, the NetWare client no longer runs. There is no workaround for
this issue at this time.

5.1.7   Dynamic Update
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For Whistler Personal, Whistler Professional, Whistler Server, and
Whistler Advanced Server, Setup contains a new feature known as
Dynamic Update, which can be used to download updated drivers and
files needed for Setup. In order to determine the appropriate files
needed for your computer, Dynamic Update collects anonymous
information about your computer's current hardware devices. The
information collected does not include any personally identifiable
information and will not be used for any purpose other than to request
that update files are sent to your computer. This information will not
be permanently stored. 

As part of an ongoing effort to improve the Dynamic Update process,
the aggregate information about the success and failures of Dynamic
Update installations is stored by Microsoft and used to evaluate and
improve the effectiveness of our Dynamic Update services. As part of
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to privacy and confidentiality
policies, none of this logged statistical data will contain any
information that can identify you or is in any way traceable to you or
your computer.

5.2   Preinstallation Notes for 32-Bit Editions of Whistler Only
======================================================================

5.2.1   Windows Millennium Edition Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After you upgrade from Windows Millennium Edition to Whistler Personal
or Whistler Professional, any files originally stored in the My
Pictures folder are moved to the folder C:\My Documents\My Pictures.
As a result, the My Pictures link in the Start menu might not function
correctly. No data loss occurs. You can gain access to your folders by
navigating to C:\My Documents\My Pictures. This issue will be
addressed in a future release.

5.2.2   Product Activation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On all versions of Whistler, if the registry does not contain a
ProductID key in the registry key 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion

then Windows Product Activation does not successfully activate the
product. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

Caution: Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your
system. Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any
valued data on the computer.

5.2.3   Dynamic Update - Drivers in Subdirectories
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On all versions of Whistler, if drivers are posted on a corporate
Windows Update site in subdirectories, Dynamic Update does not
enumerate these drivers and does not install them on the client
system. To work around this issue, place all of the drivers in the
root directory.

5.2.4   Upgrading to Whistler with DirectX 8.0 or 8.0a Installed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following warning message appears during Setup when upgrading to
any version of Whistler with DirectX 8.0 or DirectX 8.0a previously
installed: "To Maintain compatibility with your DirectX 8.0
application, you will need to download the DirectX 8.0 updated for
Windows 2000." To work around this issue, ignore the message and click
OK. Setup will continue normally. This issue will be addressed in a
future release.

5.2.5   Hardware Drive Letter Mappings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On computers running Whistler Personal, Whistler Professional, or
Whistler Server, user-defined drive letter mappings for removable
media devices such as CD-ROM, CD-RW, Zip, Jazz, and so on, might be
changed back to their original drive letters when upgrading from
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Special Edition, or Windows
Millennium Edition. Applications which look for the previously defined
drive letter assignments can encounter difficulties in locating the
removable media. To work around this issue, the drive letter mapping
can be changed by using the Disk Management snap-in. This issue will
be addressed in a future release.

>>> To work around this issue:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Administrative Tools.

2. Double-click Computer Management.

3. In the details pane, double-click Storage.

4. Double-click Disk Management.

5. To change the drive letter, right-click the drive needing to be 
   changed, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths. Click the 
   new drive letter, then click OK.

5.2.6   Upgrading from Japanese Versions of Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before upgrading from versions of Windows 98, Windows 98 Second
Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition localized for Japan that have
Office XP installed to any version of Whistler, first uninstall the
Office Japanese IME. Do this by using Add/Remove Application in Office
XP. Failure to do this will prevent Whistler from starting after
Setup. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

5.2.7   Volume Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whistler does not support Windows NT 4.0 Ftdisk volume sets. If you
are running Windows 2000, you must convert all Ftdisk volume sets to
dynamic volumes before upgrading. If you are running Windows NT 4.0,
you should break any mirrors and back up all data on stripe, RAID5, or
extended volume sets before upgrading. Ftdisk sets might not be
accessible after the upgrade.

5.2.8   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade a computer with a Diamond Monster Sound MX400 card and
ESS Technology Canyon3D chip set from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler
Personal or Whistler Professional, the audio does not function
correctly after the upgrade.

5.2.9   Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 or
earlier to Whistler Server or Whistler Advanced Server with Host
Integration Server (HIS) 2000 installed, the computer might stop
responding. To work around this issue, change the SNAbase service to
manual before you perform the upgrade.

>>> To change the SNAbase service and then perform the upgrade:

1. Change the SNAbase service to manual.

2. Stop the service.


3. Upgrade to Whistler, and then manually restart the SNAbase service.

If you are in the process of upgrading to Whistler and HIS 2000 is
installed, the computer might stop responding on the final restart. To
work around this issue, start in Safe Mode with Networking and change
the SNAbase service to manual.

>>> To start in Safe Mode with Networking and change the SNAbase
service:

1. After the computer stops responding on the final restart, restart
   the computer in Safe Mode with Networking.

2. Change the SNAbase service to manual, stop the service, and then
   restart the computer. The computer starts up normally with
   SNAbase stopped.

3. SNAbase can then be restarted in Services.msc.

5.2.10   Acer TravelMate 350 Computers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On Acer TravelMate 350 computers running Whistler Personal or Whistler
Professional, Setup stops responding after the first restart in tex
t-mode Setup. There are no workarounds. This issue will be addressed
in a future release.

5.2.11   Toshiba Portege 34xx-series Laptops
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whistler Personal and Whistler Professional do not successfully
complete clean installations on Toshiba Portege 34xx-series laptops
due to a second integrated drive electronics (IDE) controller issue.
To work around this issue, migrate from the original equipment
manufacturer preloaded factory recovery image.

5.3   Preinstallation Notes for 64-Bit Editions of Whistler Only
======================================================================

5.3.1   Converting Master Boot Record Disks to GUID Partition Table
  Disks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On computers running Whistler Professional, Whistler Advanced Server,
or Whistler Datacenter Server, the master boot record (MBR) Extensible
Firmware Interface (EFI) System Partition and operating system
installation partition are not supported. Whistler Itanium-based
operating systems require globally unique identifier (GUID) partition
table (GPT) disks and cannot install on or start from MBR disks.
Computers must have GPT partitions in order to support the version of
Boot Manager that is included in the Whistler Beta 2 release. If your
system disk is not a GPT disk, it must be converted to a GPT disk
before installing Whistler Itanium-based operating systems. Although
earlier beta versions of Whistler Itanium-based operating systems
included workarounds while the hardware, firmware, and operating
systems were being designed, MBR disks must now be converted to GPT
disks for Whistler Beta 2. This issue will not be addressed in a
future release.

GPT disks have many advantages compared to MBR disks such as:
   * Redundant partition tables
   * Ability to creating partitions up to 18 exabytes in size
   * Defined partition scheme for storing specific data

For additional information about GPT disks, see the Microsoft Windows
"Whistler" and GPT: Frequently Asked Questions Web site at:

http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/storage/Whistler-GPT_FAQ.htm

To add GPT partitions, a clean installation must be made by installing
from the Whistler Beta 2 CD. First, however, you need to determine
whether the system has already been upgraded to GPT disks.

>>> To determine if your system has been upgraded to GPT disks:

1. Right-click My Computer, and then click Manage (Click 64-bit 
   snap-ins if you are given the option).

2. Click Disk Management.

3. Right-click Disk 0, and then click Properties.

4. On the Volumes tab, if the Partition style entry lists a GPT disk, 
   the system has been upgraded. If it lists an MBR disk, the disk 
   must be completely repartitioned and the operating system must be 
   set up again.

If you need to repartition the disk, before you start, complete the
following procedure.

>>> To prepare to repartition your disk:

1. Move all data to another system or storage device.

2. Obtain a copy of the Whistler Beta 2 CD. To repartition the disk, 
   you must perform a clean installation by using the Whistler Beta 2 
   CD.

Important: The following steps are a sample procedure for
repartitioning the disk and installing the operating system. The
actual procedure might differ depending on the type of computer.

>>> To repartition your disk: 

1. Restart the computer and stop the startup process at the EFI shell.
   
   To stop the system at the EFI shell, press any key while the 
   following message is displayed on the screen: "Will launch... 
   \os\winnt50\ia64ldr.efi. Press any key to abort autoload." This 
   causes the system to stop at the prompt Shell>.

2. At the prompt, type:

   MAP

   This locates the CD-ROM file system designator, fsx, where 'x' is a
   
   number associated with a hard drive on your system.

3. The device descriptions for the disk devices in your system appear.
   
   The fsx entry looks like the following example:

   fs1: VenHw(Unknown Device:FF)/CDROM(Entry 1)

   The CD-ROM drive is normally fs1. However, the number can vary if 
   other drives exist on the system with EFI mountable partitions such
   
   as another EFI System Partition (ESP).

4. In the CD-ROM box, type:

   FSX

   where 'X' is replaced with the number as noted in the Step 3. The 
   prompt changes to reflect the new selection. In the previous 
   example, the prompt changes to:

   fs1:\>

5. Start the text setup mode and delete any partitions on Disk 0. At 
   the fs1:\> prompt, type:

   SETUPLDR

6. Follow the instructions that appear. At the partition selection 
   prompt, delete all of the partitions on Disk 0.

7. Change the disk style. After the partitions have been deleted, an 
   additional choice is offered for how to prepare a disk for Whistler
   
   installation. To change the disk style, type:

   S

8. When Setup indicates that an EFI System Partition is needed, you 
   can choose to create one. To create the EFI System Partition, at 
   the prompt, type:

   Y

9. Create any additional partitions. After a short delay 
   (approximately 30 seconds), the system creates both the EFI System 
   Partition, which is approximately 100 MB, and the Microsoft 
   Reserved Partition (MSR), which is approximately 31 MB.

   After these partitions are created, you can set up any additional 
   partitions, including multiple partitions to support multiple 
   operating system installations.

Important: Do not delete the 100-MB EFI System Partition and the 31-MB
MSR partitions that text-mode Setup automatically creates. The EFI
System Partition is displayed as "Partition1 [FAT] 102 MB (101 MB
free)." The MSR partition is displayed as "Partition2 [Unknown] 31 MB
(0 MB free)."

Note: To support multiple installations, create multiple data
partitions in text-mode Setup. When these steps are completed,
continue through the normal setup procedures.

5.3.2   EFI Boot Manager Support
----------------------------------------------------------------------

EFI Boot Manager supports upgrades (as long as you are running with
GPT disks and do not revert to non-Boot Manager startup) or clean
installations to Whistler Professional, Whistler Advanced Server, or
Whistler Datacenter Server. You can use your existing installation as
a safe version and can gain access to it by using the previously
established start (boot) method if you choose. In order to do this,
you MUST make a backup of your current Boot.nvr. To do this, before
performing an installation of Whistler Professional, Whistler Advanced
Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, stop at the EFI shell and copy
the file to a backup. Once you have your Boot.nvr file backed up, you
can perform a clean installation by using Setup. If you do not make a
backup of Boot.nvr, perform an upgrade when prompted by Setup and when
Boot Manager support is provided.

Important: You MUST be running GPT EFI system and operating system
disk partitions in order to install Whistler Beta 2. For information
about converting your system to GPT disks, see "Converting Master Boot
Record Disks to GUID Partition Table Disks" earlier in this document.

When your computer restarts after completing Setup, a new Boot menu
item appears in the displayed list. Previously, the computer would
have switched to the EFI shell. Because this is a new installation, it
appears first in the list of options for restarting. Enter the default
instance of the operating system. Since you can no longer manipulate
the debugger options and other Boot.nvr variables, a tool is included
that helps you modify the non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM)
entries. The EFI utility tool, Nvrboot.efi, is located in the EFI
System Partition in the MSutils subdirectory. In addition to
manipulating the start order and the items that appear in the Boot
Manager menu, you can use this tool to import and export the entire
NVRAM. If NVRAM becomes damaged, this EFI utility tool is very useful.
We strongly recommend running this tool before making significant
changes to your NVRAM variables.

Important: Once all of your start options are stored in NVRAM, you
cannot program the start options back into NVRAM without an existing
backup of the NVRAM. The operating system makes a backup of each
instance of the operating system that is installed. You will not be
able to restore other entries that are damaged unless you have made a
backup of the NVRAM.

Important: Do not perform any firmware updates on Intel Itanium
Workstation SDVs running current versions of the firmware (89b) unless
you have made a backup of the NVRAM data. There is currently a bug in
the flash routines that deletes all of the NVRAM entries. This issue
will be addressed in a future release of the firmware.

If you made a backup of your Boot.nvr file prior to installing
Whistler Beta 2, you can gain access to it by using the following
procedure.

>>> To access Boot.nvr:

1. You must copy the backup you made, Boot.xxx, to Boot.nvr, where 
   'xxx' is the extension the user defined when making the backup. 
   (During the installation of the version that includes NVRAM,
   changes were made that need to be undone.)

2. Once you have copied Boot.xxx back to Boot.nvr, you can start your 
   existing installation by choosing the EFI shell at the Boot Manager
   
   prompt while the computer is starting.

If you performed an upgrade, your computer accesses all of its
operating system start options through the Boot Manager. Additional
clean installations appear in the Boot Manager. You no longer can gain
access to the EFI shell to start an operating system. You also no
longer need to manipulate Boot.nvr to support multi-boot scenarios.
These issues will not be addressed in a future release.

5.3.3   Firmware Versions Used in Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you experience difficulties installing Whistler Professional,
Whistler Advanced Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, revert to the
following firmware versions to determine whether the newer version of
the firmware is the source of the difficulty:
 
   * For Whistler Professional, Whistler Advanced Server, and Whistler
     Datacenter Server, testing was done on the Intel Software 
     Development Vehicle (SDV) 1p workstation, 2p workstation, and 4p 
     server systems running Intel firmware Build 89b. 

   * Testing was done on the SDV 4p server alpha/beta systems running 
     Intel firmware Build 71. 

During the testing of these firmware versions, the following issues
were discovered:
   
   * The computer might stop responding if you perform a full format. 
     To work around this issue, use Quick Format to format the GUID 
     partition table (GPT) disks.

   * After making changes to Boot Manager entries by using Nvrboot.efi
     
     while in the EFI shell, the changes are not displayed on the EFI 
     Boot Manager screen if you exit the EFI shell. To work around 
     this issue, once you manipulate Boot Manager entries, you must 
     restart your system.

   * After upgrading the flash memory (also known as "flashing" the 
     firmware) for this version of firmware to the Workstation SDV, 
     the non-volatile random access memory entries are cleared. This 
     includes entries for the EFI Boot Manager. You must back up your 
     Boot Manager entries before upgrading the flash memory for the 
     firmware.

Note: This is a partial list of potential firmware issues you might
encounter while installing Whistler Itanium-based operating systems.
You might encounter other issues.

These issues will be addressed in a future release.

5.3.4   GUID Partition Table Disks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whistler Professional, Whistler Advanced Server, and Whistler
Datacenter Server support the use of globally unique identifier (GUID)
partition table (GPT) disks. The Whistler Setup Wizard, during a clean
installation, automatically creates all the required partitions (EFI
System Partition), Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition, and basic data
partition) using a GPT scheme. This issue will not be addressed in a
future release.

>>> To use GPT disks with the partitioning scheme created
automatically during the setup process:

1. Make sure the disks in your computer do not have any partitions.

2. Insert the Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive.

3. The installation program proceeds to the Setup Welcome page and 
   displays the message, "Press any key to boot from CD."

4. Press any key, and the Setup Wizard starts.

5. Follow the instructions that appear.

Important: To fully implement GPT support, you must be running the
versions of the firmware listed in "Firmware Versions Used in Testing"
earlier in this document.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Datacenter Server, you can use clustering to ensure
that users have constant access to important server-based resources.
With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to 
users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another 
node begins to provide service (a process known as failover). 
Mission critical applications and resources remain continuously 
available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Datacenter Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer
of your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you
need in order to use the hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several options. You can:

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server and
   install Cluster service at the same time. For important
   information about preparing for cluster installation,
   see "Installation on Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help.

For more information about reinstalling clustering on one of the 
cluster nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.


======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file series. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes 
if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file series.

2.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with the following
hardware and software:

 * A cluster storage unit using Fibre Channel, not SCSI. Fibre
   Channel is the only type of cluster storage on the Hardware
   Compatibility List for Datacenter Server. (Note that SCSI can be
   used for a two-node cluster with Advanced Server, not Datacenter
   Server.) 

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Datacenter Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Datacenter
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file series.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on another node. After the groups are moved,
   one node is idle, and the other nodes handle all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Datacenter Server Setup to upgrade the paused node
   from Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see
   sections earlier in this text file series.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Datacenter
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
They involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run different versions
of the operating system. For a mixed-version cluster to work, the
different versions of the software running on each node must be
prepared to communicate with one another. This requirement leads to
several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new resource 
types to prevent these resources from failing over to a Windows 2000 
node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you view the 
possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node will not 
be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to the list. 
If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase of a 
rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources will 
not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
--------------     ------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported during rolling upgrades. For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file series.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, as well as the 
product documentation that comes with the application or resource.

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS 
resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file. 

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

   Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
   on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ 
resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text files, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file series.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.


======================================================================
3.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

3.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan 
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is  running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously. 
Each node of your cluster must be running Datacenter Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

* Cluster hardware and drivers.

  Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and 
  other cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Datacenter 
  Server. To check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on 
  The Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
  up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
  Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

  http://www.microsoft.com/

  You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fiber
  Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk 
  adapter.

  Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
  cluster storage hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server. (Drivers 
  are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

  Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
  installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
  be corrupted. 

  To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
  problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

* Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

  In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
  adapter will carry.

  Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
  plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
  and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
  adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
  subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   --------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).
3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
whenever you are configuring the server.

* Cluster IP address.

  Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
  DHCP for this address.

* IP addressing for cluster nodes.

  Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
  Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You can 
  provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each network 
  adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP addresses, the 
  addresses for each linked pair of network adapters (linked 
  node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

  Note: If you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
  single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
  so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
  temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
  unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
  DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
  consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster nodes. 
  This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP address.

* Cluster name.

  Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is 
  the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
  (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
  different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
  the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
  other cluster names on the domain.

* Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

  Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
  same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

* Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
  service.

  To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
  each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
  those nodes.

* Cluster service user account.

  Create or obtain Cluster service user account. This is the 
  name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
  will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
  installation.

  The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
  account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
  account also must have local administrative privileges on all of the
  cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the
  account (follow your organization's policies for password renewal).

* Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
  and log files).

  You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
  for holding important cluster configuration information. This
  information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
  when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
  node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

  The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should 
  use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user 
  data.

* List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
  which you will install clustering.

  Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
  relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
  make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
  This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
  during cluster configuration.

  Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
  cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
  formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
  not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned volumes 
  (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

3.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

3.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

While remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that
you can scan the bus and see the drives from all cluster nodes.

3.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service 
are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

3.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Datacenter Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Datacenter Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Datacenter Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then click 
Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

======================================================================
1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

When you set up Windows XP Home Edition, you have to provide
information about how you want to install the operating system. The
procedures in these release notes help you to provide the necessary
information. To ensure a successful installation, complete the
following tasks, which are described in the sections that follow,
before you install Windows XP:

   * Make sure your hardware components meet the minimum requirements.

   * Obtain compatible hardware and software, such as
     upgrade packs and new drivers.

   * Back up your current files in case you need to
     restore your current operating system.

   * Determine whether you want to perform an upgrade or install a new
     copy of Windows XP Home Edition.

1.1 Hardware Requirements
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP Home Edition, make sure your computer 
meets the following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 233 megahertz (MHz) Pentium or higher microprocessor (or 
     equivalent)
   * 128 megabytes (MB) recommended (64 MB of RAM minimum; 
     4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM maximum)
   * 1.5 GB of free space on your hard disk
   * VGA monitor
   * Keyboard
   * Mouse or compatible pointing device 
   * CD-ROM or DVD drive

1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard automatically checks your hardware and 
software and reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful
installation, however, you should determine whether your computer
hardware is compatible with Windows XP Home Edition before you run the
wizard.

You can view the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft
Web site:

http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/

      Important: Windows XP Home Edition supports only those devices 
      listed in the HCL. If your hardware isn't listed, contact 
      the hardware manufacturer and request a Windows XP 
      driver for the component. To ensure that programs using 16-bit 
      drivers function properly afterwards, request 32-bit drivers 
      from the software vendor.

During the setup process, you can use upgrade packs to make your 
existing software compatible with Windows XP Home Edition. Upgrade
packs are available from the appropriate software manufacturers.

1.3 Backing Up Your Files
======================================================================

If you're upgrading from an earlier version of Windows, you should
back up your current files to a disk or a tape drive.

If your computer is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, you 
may need to install the Windows Backup program. For more information
about installing or using Windows Backup, see your Windows 95 or
Windows 98 Help.

1.4 Upgrading vs. Installing a New Copy
======================================================================

After you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard, one of the first
decisions you have to make is whether to upgrade your current
operating system or perform an entirely new installation (a "clean
install").

During an upgrade, the wizard replaces existing Windows files but 
preserves your existing settings and applications. Some applications 
might not be compatible with Windows XP Home Edition and therefore
might not function properly after an upgrade. You can upgrade to
Windows XP Home Edition from the following operating systems:

   * Windows 98 (all versions)
   * Windows Millennium Edition

If your computer is currently running an unsupported operating 
system, you must install a new copy of Windows XP Home Edition. The
wizard installs Windows XP Home Edition in a new folder. After the
installation is complete, you will have to reinstall applications and
reset your preferences.

You should UPGRADE if all           You should INSTALL a new copy 
of the following are true:          if any of the following are true:
===========================         ==============================

You're already using an earlier     Your hard disk is blank.
version of Windows that 
supports upgrading.
     
- and -                             - or - 

You want to replace your            Your current operating system 
previous Windows operating          doesn't support an upgrade to 
system with Windows XP.             Windows XP. 

- and -                             - or - 

You want to keep your existing      You already use an operating 
files and preferences.              system, but you don't want to 
                                    keep your existing files and 
                                    preferences, so that you
                                    can cleanly install. 

If you want to modify the way the wizard installs Windows XP Home
Edition, you can click Advanced Options, and then perform any of the
following tasks:

   * Change the default location of the Setup files.
   * Store system files in a folder other than the default folder
     (\Windows).
   * Copy the installation files from the CD to the hard disk.
   * Select the partition on which to install Windows XP Home Edition.

Unless you're an advanced user, it's recommended that you use the
default settings.

======================================================================
2.0 Running Windows XP Setup 
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard gathers information, including regional 
settings, names, and passwords. The wizard then copies the appropriate

files to your hard disk, checks the hardware, and configures your 
installation. When the installation is complete, you're ready to log
on to Windows XP Home Edition. Note that your computer restarts
several times during the process.

How you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard depends on whether you're 
upgrading or installing a new copy of Windows XP Home Edition.
Determine your installation method, locate the appropriate section in
these release notes, and then follow the procedures for your scenario.

2.1 If You're Installing a New Copy (Clean Install)
======================================================================

If your computer has a blank hard disk or your current operating
system isn't supported, you need to start your computer by using the 
Windows XP Home Edition CD. Some newer CD-ROM drives can start the
installation from the CD and automatically run the Windows XP
Setup Wizard.

>>> To install a new copy by using the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Home Edition CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, click Install Windows. 
      The Windows XP Setup Wizard appears.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Type the path to the setup file, replacing 
      'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM drive: 
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      
   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, select New 
      Installation, and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.2 If You're Upgrading
======================================================================

The upgrade process is simple. The Windows XP Setup Wizard detects and
installs the appropriate drivers, or it creates a report listing 
devices that couldn't be upgraded, so you can be sure your hardware 
and software are compatible with Windows XP Home Edition.

>>> To upgrade from the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Home Edition CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, the Windows XP Home 
      Edition CD dialog box appears. To start your upgrade, 
      click Install Windows.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Then type the path to the setup file, 
      replacing 'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM drive:
      
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      
   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, select Upgrade, 
      and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.3 Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings in
the following screens, depending on the current configuration of your
computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to 
     continue the setup process, select I accept this agreement. 

   * Select a File System. Windows XP Home Edition can automatically 
     convert partitions on your hard disk to NTFS, the recommended 
     file system for Windows XP Home Edition. Or you can choose to 
     keep your existing file systems. If you're upgrading, the wizard 
     uses your current file system.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings
     for different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person and,
     optionally, the organization to whom this copy of Windows XP Home
     Edition is licensed.

   * Computer Name. Type a unique computer name. The wizard suggests a
     computer name, but you can change the name.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you 
     want Windows XP Home Edition to automatically adjust for 
     daylight saving time.

======================================================================
3.0 Starting Windows XP Home Edition
======================================================================

After gathering information, the Windows XP Setup Wizard completes the
installation. Your computer restarts several times, and then 
Windows XP Home Edition prompts you to log on. After you log on, you
can activate and register your copy of Windows XP Home Edition, create
user accounts, and reconfigure any settings that you entered during
the setup process.

      Important: You must have a "computer administrator" user account 
      to activate and register Windows XP Home Edition, as well as to 
      create user accounts and change your computer's settings. 

      To check your account type, click Start, click Control Panel,
      and then click User Accounts.

3.1 Logging on to Windows XP Home Edition
======================================================================

When your computer restarts after installation, log on to 
Windows XP Home Edition for the first time. If you upgraded from an
earlier version of Windows and already have an existing user account, 
you can log on using that account and password.

3.2 Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password and your 
personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified 
by a user name and a password, both of which the user types when 
logging on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts 
if you log on using an account that has Administrator rights.

>>> To create a user account: 

   1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. 

   2. Double-click User Accounts. 

   3. Click Create a new account.

   4. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

     or see "Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility" later in 
     this document.

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard automatically checks your hardware and 
software and reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful
installation, however, you should determine whether your computer
hardware is compatible with Windows XP Professional before you start 
the wizard.

You can view the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft
Web site:

http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/

      Important: Windows XP Professional supports only those devices 
      listed in the HCL. If your hardware isn't listed, contact 
      the hardware manufacturer and request a Windows XP Professional 
      driver for the component. To ensure that programs using 16-bit 
      drivers function properly afterwards, request 32-bit drivers 
      from the software vendor.

During the setup process, you can use upgrade packs to make your 
existing software compatible with Windows XP Professional. Upgrade
packs are available from the appropriate software manufacturers.

1.3 Obtaining Network Information
======================================================================

If your computer won't be connected to a network, you can skip this
section.

First, you need to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you don't know which option to choose, or if your
computer won't be connected to a network, select the workgroup option.
(You can always join a domain after you install Windows XP
Professional.) If you select the domain option, ask your network 
administrator to create a new computer account in that domain or reset
your existing account.

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request the
following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer
   * Name of the workgroup or domain
   * TCP/IP address (if your network doesn't have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during the setup process, you must have the
correct hardware installed on your computer and be connected by a
network cable. 

1.4 Backing Up Your Files
======================================================================

If you're upgrading from an earlier version of Windows, you should
back up your current files. You can back up files to a disk, a tape
drive, or another computer on your network.

How you back up your files depends on your current operating system.
If your computer is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, you 
might need to install the Windows Backup program. If you're using 
Windows NT 4.0, Windows Backup is installed by default. You must have 
a tape drive installed to use the Backup tool in Windows NT.

For more information about installing or using Windows Backup, see 
Help and Support Services.

1.5 Upgrading vs. Installing a New Copy
======================================================================

After you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard, one of the first
decisions you have to make is whether to upgrade your current
operating system or to perform an entirely new installation. During
the setup process, you must choose between upgrading or installing a
new copy of Windows (a "clean install").

During an upgrade, the Windows XP Setup Wizard replaces existing
Windows files but preserves your existing settings and applications.
Some applications might not be compatible with Windows XP Professional
and therefore might not function properly after an upgrade. You can 
upgrade to Windows XP Professional from the following
operating systems:

   * Windows 98 (all versions)
   * Windows Millennium Edition
   * Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (Service Pack 6 and later)
   * Windows 2000 Professional (including service packs)
   * Windows XP Home Edition

If your computer is currently running an unsupported operating 
system, you must install a new copy. The wizard installs Windows XP
Professional in a new folder. After the installation is complete, you 
will have to reinstall applications and reset your preferences.

You should UPGRADE if all           You should INSTALL a new copy 
of the following are true:          if any of the following are true:
=========================           ==============================

                                    keep your existing files and
                                    preferences, so that you
                                    can cleanly install. 

If you want to modify the way the wizard installs Windows XP
Professional, click Advanced Options, and then perform any of the 
following tasks:

   * Change the default location of the setup files.
   * Store system files in a folder other than the default folder
     (\Windows).
   * Copy the installation files from the CD to the hard disk.
   * Select the partition on which to install Windows XP Professional.

Unless you're an advanced user, you should use the default settings.

======================================================================
2.0 Running Windows XP Setup 
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard gathers information, including regional 
settings, names, and passwords. The wizard then copies the appropriate
files to your hard disk, checks the hardware, and configures your 
installation. When the installation is complete, you're ready to log 
on to Windows XP Professional. Note that your computer restarts
several times during the process.

How you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard depends on whether you're 
upgrading or installing a new copy of Windows. Determine your 
installation method, locate the appropriate section in these release 
notes, and then follow the procedures for your Setup scenario.

2.1 If You're Installing a New Copy (Clean Install)
======================================================================

If your computer has a blank hard disk or your current operating
system isn't supported, you need to start your computer by using the 
Windows XP Professional CD. Some newer CD-ROM drives can start the 
installation from the CD and automatically run the Windows XP Setup 
Wizard.

>>> To install a new copy by using the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Professional CD into your 
      CD-ROM drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, click Install Windows. 
      The Windows XP Setup Wizard appears.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Type the following path to the setup 
      file, replacing 'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM 
      drive: 
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      
   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, 
      select New Installation, and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

>>> To install a new copy by using a network connection: 

   1. Using your existing operating system, establish your connection
      to the shared network folder that contains the Setup files.
      You can also use an MS-DOS or network installation disk to
      connect to the network server, if the disk contains network
      client software.

      Your network administrator will be able to provide you
      with this path.

   2. If your computer is currently running Windows 98, 
      Windows Millennium Edition, or an earlier version of Windows NT,
      
      then at the command prompt, type the path to the file 
      setup.exe.

   3. Press ENTER. 

   4. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.2 If You're Upgrading
======================================================================

The upgrade process is simple. The Windows XP Setup Wizard detects and
installs the appropriate drivers, or it creates a report listing 
devices that couldn't be upgraded, so you can be sure your hardware 
and software is compatible with Windows XP Professional.

>>> To upgrade from the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Professional CD into your
      CD-ROM drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, the Windows XP 
      Professional CD dialog box appears. To start your upgrade, 
      click Install Windows.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Then type the path to the setup 
      file, replacing 'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM 
      drive: 
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      

   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, 
      select Upgrade, and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

>>> To upgrade from a network connection: 

   1. Using your current operating system, establish a connection to
      the shared network folder that contains the Setup files. If
      you have an MS-DOS or network installation disk that contains
      network client software, you can use that disk to connect to
      the shared folder. 

      Your network administrator will be able to provide you with 
      this path. 

   2. At the command prompt, type the path to the file setup.exe. 

   3. Press ENTER. 

   4. Select Upgrade, and then click Next. 

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.3 Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is 
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings on
the following pages, depending on the current configuration of your 
computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to 
     continue the setup process, select I accept this agreement.

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Windows XP installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations. You
     can set up Windows XP to use multiple languages and regional
     settings.

   * Select a File System. Windows XP Professional can automatically 
     convert partitions on your hard disk to NTFS, the recommended 
     file system for Windows XP Professional, or you can choose to 
     keep your existing file systems. If you're upgrading, the wizard 
     uses your current file system.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings
     for different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person to 
     whom this copy of Windows XP Professional is licensed and, 
     optionally, the organization.

   * Computer Name and Administrator Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain
     names on your network. The wizard suggests a computer name, but
     you can change the name.

     During the installation, the wizard automatically creates an 
     Administrator account. When you use this account, you have full 
     rights over the computer's settings and can create user accounts 
     on the computer. That is, logging on as an Administrator after
     you install Windows XP Professional gives you administrative
     privileges that you need to log on and manage your computer. Type 
     a password for the Administrator account. For security reasons, 
     you should always assign a password to the Administrator account.
     Take care to remember and protect your password.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether
     you want Windows XP Professional to automatically adjust for
     daylight saving time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you're an advanced user, select the
     Typical settings option for your network configuration.
     To manually configure network clients, services, and protocols, 
     select the Custom settings option.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must 
     choose to join either a workgroup or a domain.

     For more information, see "Providing Networking Information"
     later in this document.

   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who 
     will be using your computer. If you indicate that you're the only
     user, you're assigned Administrator rights.

2.4 Providing Networking Information
======================================================================

During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you won't be working on a network, choose to join a 
workgroup.

2.4.1 Joining a Workgroup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a "peer-to-peer" network). Any user can join a workgroup by 
specifying the workgroup name - you don't need special permissions to 
join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup name, 
or you can use the workgroup name that the Windows XP Setup Wizard 
suggests.

2.4.2 Joining a Domain 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, and the 
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network 
administrator. Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself, 
joining a domain requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must have a computer 
account in the domain you want to join. If you're upgrading from 
Windows NT, the Windows XP Setup Wizard uses your existing computer 
account. Otherwise, you'll be asked to provide a new computer account.

Before you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard, ask your network 
administrator to create a computer account. Or, if you have the 
appropriate privileges, you can create the account during the setup 
process and join the domain. To join a domain during the setup 
process, you need to provide your user name and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup 
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Windows XP Professional.

======================================================================
3.0 Customizing Setup Using Unattended Setup Mode
======================================================================

You can customize the installation of Windows XP Professional. By 
using unattended Setup mode, you can preset information so that you 
don't have to manually enter it during the setup process. 

By using an answer file, network administrators and experienced users 
can perform a new installation in unattended Setup mode. In unattended
Setup mode, no user intervention is required during the setup process,
because the answer file contains all of the information that the 
Windows XP Setup Wizard requires, including acceptance of the license 
agreement, computer name, and network adapter. Answer files can help 
you quickly install Windows XP Professional on more than one computer.

A sample answer file, Unattend.txt, is included in the i386 folder on 
the Windows XP Professional CD. By using the file as a template, you 
can create your own answer file to customize the setup process. 

======================================================================
4.0 Starting Windows XP Professional 
======================================================================

After gathering the required information, the Windows XP Setup Wizard 
completes the installation. Your computer restarts several times, and 
then Windows XP Professional prompts you to log on. After you log on,
if you have Administrator rights, you can activate your copy of
Windows XP Professional, create user accounts, and reconfigure any
settings that you entered during the setup process.

4.1 Logging on to Windows XP Professional
======================================================================

When you install Windows XP Professional, Setup prompts you to create
a user account for yourself and one for each person who regularly uses
the computer, whether in an office or home.

Important: If you have Administrator rights, you can assign
permissions to each user account. For example, you can determine
whether a user may install software, view other users' documents, or
operate network resources such as printers and servers. 

4.2 Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you're a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator 
rights.

>>> To create a user account: 

   1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

   2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click User Accounts. 

   3. Click Add.

   4. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

After making the decisions outlined in this text file series, you'll
be ready to run Whistler Setup and, later, to use the Configure Your
Server Wizard. Together, Setup and Configure Your Server help you get
your servers up and running quickly. To find out more about Configure
Your Server, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
click Help and Support.

======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen
hardware that supports Whistler Server.

1.1   System Requirements
======================================================================

To ensure adequate performance, the computers on which you
will install Whistler Server must meet the following requirements:

 * Pentium or higher central processing unit (CPU), with a
   recommended speed of 550 MHz (minimum supported speed is
   233 MHz).

   Whistler Server supports a maximum of 4 CPUs per computer.

 * 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended (128 MB minimum
   supported; 4 gigabytes (GB) maximum).

 * A hard disk partition with enough free space to accommodate the
   setup process. The minimum amount of space required is
   approximately 1 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than a new installation, because
     the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as
     a factor of ten during the upgrade as Active Directory
     functionality is added.

Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in the
previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space 
used for the operating system (excluding user accounts) is usually 
less than the free space required for Setup, depending on the system 
components installed.

For additional information about planning the sizes of disk
partitions, including information about creating a separate partition 
for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning Disk Partitions for 
New Installations" later in this text file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL. The HCL is described in the following section,
   "Hardware Compatibility."

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the setup files.

1.2   Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Whistler Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and
reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful installation,
however, check to make sure your computer hardware is compatible with
Whistler Server before running Setup.

To do this, see the Whistler Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). If
your hardware is not listed, Setup might not be successful. (Note that
one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.)

To see the version of the HCL that was released with Whistler, on the
Whistler CD, in the Support folder, open Hcl.txt. For the most 
up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility 
List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/

In addition, check that you have updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based
computer) or Extensible Firmware Interface (for an Itanium-based
computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these
items. For more information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see
"Understanding ACPI BIOS" later in this text file series.

Finally, before installing Whistler Server, consider taking a device
inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more
information, see the following section.

1.3   Taking an Optional Device Inventory
======================================================================

To ensure smooth functioning of your adapters and other devices in
your computer, be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file series. For specific
information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI,
RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the
manufacturer, see "Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File"
later in this text file series.

Whistler includes Plug and Play technology so that devices (for
example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized
by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you
do not have to specify each device's settings by hand. However, if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your
Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards,
you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts.
This section describes the steps you can take, if you choose, to
understand your device configuration before running Setup.

To better understand the configuration of the devices in your
computer, take an inventory. To do this, if your computer has an
existing operating system, use it to obtain the current settings, such
as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices.
For example, with Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view
settings (on the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel,
and then double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also
choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen
while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when
prompted.

During Setup, Whistler automatically takes a device inventory. 
However, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following 
difficulties:

 * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
   Whistler might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent
   this, you can take one of two approaches.

   You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and 
   re-install it afterward. For more information about hardware and 
   configuration, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
   and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
   click Help and Support.

   Alternatively, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
   memory addresses before running Setup so that each adapter's
   settings are unique.

 * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
   Whistler to detect or enumerate them, Whistler might receive
   indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you
   might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and 
   re-install and configure them afterward. For more information
   about hardware and for configuration guidance, see Whistler Help 
   and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
   completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather before
starting Setup.

ADAPTER               INFORMATION TO GATHER
---------------       -----------------------------------------------
Video                 Adapter or chip set type and how many video 
                      adapters

Network               Network	IRQ, I/O address, DMA (if used), 
                      connector type (for example, BNC or twisted 
                      pair), and bus type

SCSI controller       Adapter model or chip set, IRQ, and bus type

Mouse                 Mouse type and port (COM1, COM2, bus, or PS/2) 
                      or USB

I/O port              IRQ, I/O address, and DMA (if used) for each 
                      I/O port

1.3.1   Understanding ACPI BIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For x86-based computers, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a
set of software through which the operating system (or Setup)
communicates with the computer's hardware devices. The Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for
the way the BIOS works. Whistler supports not only ACPI-compliant BIOS
versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power
management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions that 
appear on your screen.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

 * For information about which ACPI-based BIOS versions are 
   ACPI-compliant, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for
   Whistler. This is the definitive source for this information.
   For information about the HCL, see "Hardware Compatibility"
   earlier in this text file series.

 * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
   restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
   particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
   "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

 * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, see your
   hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.

======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup,
familiarize yourself with important files found on the root directory
of the Whistler Server CD:

 * Read1st.txt  Contains critical preinstallation notes vital to the
   success of your installation.

 * Readme.doc  Contains important usage information about hardware,
   networks, applications, and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for Whistler
Server. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility" 
earlier in this text file series.

======================================================================
3.0   Deciding Whether to Upgrade or Install
======================================================================

After you have reviewed "System Requirements," "Hardware
Compatibility," and "Important Files to Review" earlier in this text
file series, and before you run Whistler Server Setup, you
will need to determine whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation. Upgrading is replacing a version of Windows NT or 
Windows 2000 with Whistler Server. Installing, in contrast
to upgrading, means wiping out the previous operating system, or 
installing Whistler Server on a disk or disk partition with no 
previous operating system.

Note: Do not upgrade to or install Whistler on a compressed drive 
Unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression 
utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume before running 
Whistler Setup on it.

If you have already decided whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation, see the following sections later in this text file
series:

 * For an upgrade: see "Decisions to Make for an Upgrade."

 * For a new installation: see "Decisions to Make for a New
   Installation."

There are several reasons to choose to upgrade. (To determine whether
your old operating system is a version from which you can upgrade, see
the following section, "Upgrading.") Configuration is simpler, and 
your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are
retained. In addition, files and applications do not need to be 
re-installed. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, 
you should back up the disk before running Setup.

It is possible to install Whistler Server and also allow the
computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the
computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file
system issues. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this text file
series.

3.1   Upgrading
======================================================================

If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Whistler into the same
folder as the currently installed operating system. You can upgrade to
Whistler Server from the following versions of Windows:

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

 * Windows 2000 Server

If your computer is running Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, 
you can upgrade to Whistler Advanced Server, but not Whistler Server.

Note: If you are running a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0, you 
cannot upgrade directly to Whistler from it. You must first upgrade to 
Windows NT 4.0.

3.2   Installing
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a new installation, note that:

 * For a new installation on a disk partition that contains
   applications you want to keep, you must back up the applications
   and re-install them after installing Whistler Server.

 * If you want to perform a new installation of Whistler Server on a 
   partition that previously contained Whistler Server, and if you 
   want to keep any documents saved in the My Documents folder, back 
   them up before beginning the installation. You can use Search to 
   find the documents. After completing the new installation, you can 
   copy the documents back to the My Documents folder.

======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, and you have a Windows NT 4.0 domain, you will
need to decide on the order of server upgrades. For more information,
see the following sections later in this text file series:

 * "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers
   First"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers
   First"

In addition, if you are upgrading from Windows NT 4.0, you will need
to decide whether to convert the file system, on any FAT or FAT32
partitions you might have, to the NTFS file system. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.

======================================================================
5.0   Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

Domains are an important feature of Windows servers and clients. A
domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a single
domain name and security boundary. It is necessary to have one or more
domains if you want to use domain-based user accounts and other domain
security features in Whistler. (This was true for Windows NT and
Windows 2000 as well.) 

On computers running Whistler, servers can have one of three roles in 
relation to domains:

 * Domain controllers contain matching copies of the user accounts
   and other Active Directory data in a given domain.

 * Member servers belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the
   Active Directory data.

 * Stand-alone servers belong to a workgroup rather than a domain.

A domain must have at least one domain controller. For resilience, a
domain should have multiple domain controllers to support the handling
of logon requests and directory updates.

Before running Setup, you should plan the roles that your servers will 
Have within domains in Whistler. However, you can still adjust these 
roles after completing Setup.

There are a number of important points to remember about upgrading an
existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to run with Whistler:

 * You must use the NTFS file system on domain controllers. In
   addition, any servers that have any partition formatted with FAT
   or FAT32 will lack many security features. For example, on FAT
   or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by
   the permissions set on the share, not on individual files, and
   there is no software protection against local access to the
   partition.

 * If you want to upgrade a server and then use the same applications
   as before, be sure to read about application compatibility.

   One important source of application compatibility information is
   Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility section of Readme.doc 
   (in the root directory of the Whistler CD). For more information
   about these files, see "Important Files to Review" earlier in
   this text file series.

 * You can upgrade member servers before or after upgrading domain
   controllers. However, when you upgrade the domain controllers in
   a Windows NT domain to Whistler, you must upgrade the primary
   domain controller first.

 * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
   access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it before 
   the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a server is dependent 
   on domain controllers for user information and therefore should not 
   be "left behind" when domain controllers are upgraded. As an 
   alternative, you can decrease the security permissions on Active 
   Directory so that the remote access server running Windows NT can 
   read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. For more 
   information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
   Deployment Planning Guide."

The roles of the servers in a domain are named somewhat differently
by computers running Whistler Server as compared with those running 
Windows NT. On computers running Windows NT, the possible roles were 
primary domain controller (limited to one per domain), backup domain 
controller, member server, or stand-alone server. Whistler has only 
one kind of domain controller (without a "primary" or "backup" 
designation), and it includes the roles of member server and 
stand-alone server. When you upgrade, Setup assigns server roles as 
follows:

ROLE IN WINDOWS NT DOMAIN   ROLE IN WHISTLER DOMAIN
-------------------------   ---------------------------------------
Primary domain controller   Domain controller

Backup domain controller    Your choice of domain controller or
                            member server

Member server               Member server

Stand-alone server          Stand-alone server

5.1   Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

When planning the order of server upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
domain, there are two somewhat different approaches to choose between: 
upgrading the domain controllers first, or upgrading the member 
servers first. You can mix these approaches. However, if you have a 
Windows NT domain and you want to begin upgrading domain controllers, 
you must upgrade the primary domain controller first.

If you upgrade member servers first (without upgrading domain
controllers), a variety of features become available, but none that
require Active Directory. Once you begin upgrading domain controllers,
Active Directory features become available.

For additional information about planning the order of server
upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 domain, see the following:

 * For background information about server roles (which you must
   understand to plan the order of server upgrades), see "Upgrading
   an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * For more detailed information about upgrading domains, or
   information about upgrading domains with more than five servers,
   see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, Deployment 
   Planning Guide."

 * For information about how to carry out each kind of upgrade, see
   "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain
   Controllers First" or "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by
   Upgrading Member Servers First" later in this text file series.

The lists in "Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0
Domain Controllers" and "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain," later in this text file series, show the
features that are available with each approach to upgrading servers.

5.1.1   Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 Domain 
Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When Windows NT domain controllers are upgraded and begin
communicating on a network, all the features of Whistler become
available through these servers. Of these features, the Active
Directory features are listed in this section, and a number of other
features are listed in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Note: The features available when domain controllers are upgraded 
include not only the features in the following list, but also the 
features in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a 
Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Active Directory includes the following features:

 * Simplified management of network-resource information and user
   information.

 * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
   a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active
   Directory.

 * Security and authentication features, including support for
   Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer V3, and Transport Layer
   Security using X.509v3 certificates.

 * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
   simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
   devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
   they need. You can take advantage of synchronization support
   through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) and work with directory consolidation
   requirements specific to your applications.

 * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make 
   it easier to configure and manage applications and other 
   directory-enabled network components.

 * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
   scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
   technology and advanced replication techniques to speed
   performance.

 * Use of Internet standards, including access through LDAP and a 
   namespace based on the Domain Name System (DNS).

 * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful development
   environment.

 * Additional features.

5.1.2   Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a 
Windows NT 4.0 Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The features in the following list are available when member servers
are upgraded in a Windows NT domain, regardless of whether domain
controllers have been upgraded. The features available when domain
controllers are upgraded include not only the features in the
following list, but also the features in the previous one.

 * Management tools:
   Microsoft Management Console
   Plug and Play
   Device Manager
   Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
   Support for universal serial bus
   Enhanced Backup utility

 * File system support: The version of NTFS in Whistler includes
   support for disk quotas, the ability to defragment directory
   structures, and compressed network I/O.

 * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and Windows
   Script Host.

 * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
   choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
   enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
   Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
   over an intranet or the Internet.

 * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
   support as compared to Windows NT.

 * Security: Encrypting file system.

5.2   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain 
Controllers First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. If you are not sure which approach you want to take,
see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file series.

If you upgrade your Windows NT domain by upgrading the domain
controllers first, the upgrade has the following three stages:

 * Carrying out backups and other preparations so you can restore the
   previous installation if necessary.

 * Upgrading the primary domain controller. You must do this before
   upgrading any backup domain controllers.

 * Upgrading other servers in the domain.

This section describes the actions to take for these stages. For a
more in-depth discussion of planning the upgrade of domain
controllers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide." For information about what versions of 
Windows NT can be upgraded to Whistler Server, see "Upgrading" earlier 
in this text file series.

5.2.1   Backups and Other Preparations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your
servers, you should back up each server before upgrading it. Also, be 
sure to review "Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this 
text file series.

In addition, to safeguard your existing network integrity, you might
consider removing a backup domain controller temporarily from a
network. To do this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a
backup domain controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the
user accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
cable. After upgrading your primary domain controller to Whistler (you
must upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
controller if needed. However, in the course of a successful upgrade,
you would not and could not promote the Windows NT backup domain
controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would continue
the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the disconnected server
and upgrading it.

Also, for any computer that will be a domain controller in the
Whistler domain, make sure that there is plenty of free space on the 
disk, beyond the space needed for the operating system itself. (For
information about the disk requirements for the operating system, see
"System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.) When Setup
upgrades the user accounts database from the format used by Windows NT
to the format used by Whistler Server, the database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten.

5.2.2   Upgrading Servers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first domain controller to be upgraded in a Windows NT domain
must be the primary domain controller. As you upgrade this server, you
will be given the choices of creating a new domain or a child domain,
and of creating a new forest or a domain tree in an existing forest.
For the upgrading of a domain of two to five servers (which is the
size of domains discussed in this text file series), create a new
domain and a new forest. For information about domain structures to
use with larger numbers of servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three important
items: the database containing user accounts and other Active
Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (SYSVOL) folder.
The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition (FAT,
FAT32, or NTFS). The database can expand by as much as a factor of ten
from the size it was in Windows NT, so allow plenty of room for it.
(Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The SYSVOL 
folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information about
NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System" later in
this text file series.)

After the primary domain controller is upgraded to a Whistler domain
controller, it will be fully backward-compatible. This means that the
domain controller appears as a Whistler domain controller to Whistler
servers and clients, but emulates a Windows NT 4.0 primary domain
controller to Windows NT 4.0 servers and clients.

After upgrading your primary domain controller and ensuring that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, upgrade any backup domain
controllers next. (If possible, it is best to begin the upgrades soon,
rather than allowing a long delay.) Also, if you are running a remote 
access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it
before the last domain controller is upgraded. A remote-access member
server is dependent on domain controllers for user information and
therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers are
upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security permissions
on Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows
NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. For
more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

Note: When the second domain controller is upgraded, it copies the 
first (formerly the primary) domain controller. Therefore, be sure 
that the first domain controller is running and available on the 
network as you upgrade the second. Similarly, be sure that at least 
one Whistler domain controller is available on the network when you 
upgrade the third, fourth, and any remaining Windows NT domain 
controllers.

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Start and test each server on the
network to ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction before
upgrading another backup domain controller.

When you have completely upgraded all domain controllers to Whistler
domain controllers, you have the option of changing the domain from
mixed mode (where Windows NT domain controllers can exist in the
domain) to native mode (where only Whistler domain controllers can
exist in the domain). This is an important decision, because you
cannot revert to mixed mode after changing to native mode.

For information about domain trees, mixed mode, native mode, or any
other item related to domains, see the topics under Active Directory 
in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support 
Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support. For information about performing upgrades in domains larger 
than two to five servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

5.3   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers 
First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. For information about the advantages and disadvantages of each
approach, see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT
4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

Note: If you have a remote access server that is a member server, and 
you have begun upgrading any domain controllers, be sure to read 
"Upgrading Servers" earlier in this text file series.

Before upgrading any server, be sure to back it up, and review 
"Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this text file series.

If you upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by upgrading member servers
first, you can upgrade one, a few, or all of the member servers at a
given time. Choose the order of the upgrades by considering which of
your servers would be most improved by the features in the Whistler
Server family. For information about the features available when
member servers are upgraded, see "Features Available with Upgrade of
Any Server in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
series.

After upgrading member servers in a domain, when you are ready to
upgrade domain controllers, follow the instructions in "Upgrading a
Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First" earlier
in this text file series.

======================================================================
6.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic decisions you will need to make
if you have decided to perform a new installation. Each area is
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. You will need 
to consider the following:

6.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

6.2   Whether You Want to Be Able to Choose Between Different 
Operating Systems Each Time You Start the Computer
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" later in this text file series.

6.3   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. You should 
use NTFS because it is the only file system that supports Active
Directory, which includes many important features such as domains and
domain-based security. However, it might be necessary to have a FAT or
FAT32 partition in situations where you must set up a computer so that
it sometimes runs Whistler and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or an
earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System" later in this text file series.

6.4   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a 
New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

If you are performing a new installation, you will need to review
your disk partitions before running Setup (for an upgrade, you will
use existing partitions). A partition divides a disk into one or more
areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and D). 
After running Setup, you can modify the partitioning of the disk.
For information about planning the partitions for a new installation,
see "Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this
text file series.

6.5   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Server. You can install these components
during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the Configure
Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components for you
according to the type of server you specify. For more information
about components, see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this
text file series.

6.6   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

6.7   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier
in this text file series and "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file series.

======================================================================
7.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, 
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP, print and read this document for
critical preinstallation information concerning this release. For the
most up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware
Compatibility List at the Microsoft Web site 
(http://www.microsoft.com/). In addition, print and read the 
following files located in the \docs folder on your Windows XP 
compact disc (CD):

   * Setup instructions 

   * Release notes (relnotes.htm), important compatibility and 
     postinstallation information.

New features are described in detail in Windows XP Help and Support
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup,
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

======================================================================
2.0 System Requirements for Installation 
======================================================================

For the full list of system requirements, see the Setup instructions
for your operating system referenced in the readme.htm file on your
Windows XP CD.

======================================================================
3.0 Preinstallation Notes
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP on your computer, be sure to read this
section. This section contains information about issues that affect
the installation process. By using this information to perform your 
installation, you can ensure that the installation process proceeds 
smoothly and that Windows XP functions correctly.

3.1 Windows Product Activation (WPA)
======================================================================

Products: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only

If you are prompted to activate your installation of Windows XP, defer
activation until you have completed planned upgrades or changes to
your computer's FIXED hardware and their device drivers. Otherwise,
you may need to reactivate after making such changes. FIXED 
hardware/drivers include the first instance of devices such as
video, network (excluding modems), SCSI, hard drives, CD-ROM/DVD, and
system memory. USB or other removable devices (such as cameras and
printers) do not affect activation.

3.2 Using Passwords 
======================================================================

3.2.1 Password Backup Disk
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Products: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only

If you created a password backup disk for a previous version of
Windows, this process has changed. Re-create your password backup disk
for Windows XP.

3.2.2 Restrictions on the Use of Blank Passwords
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows XP has a new default security feature that helps protect users
with blank passwords from network-based attacks. Users who do not 
password-protect their accounts can only log on at their physical 
computer console: the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that is physically 
connected to their computer. This restriction only applies to local 
user accounts, not to domain user accounts.

Caution: If your computer is not in a physically secured location, you
should assign strong passwords to all local user accounts. Failure to
do so allows anyone with physical access to the computer to log on
using a user account that does not have a password. This is especially
important for portable computers, which should always have strong
passwords on all local user accounts.

3.3 Software Compatibility Issues 
======================================================================

3.3.1 Message Queuing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Products: Windows XP Home Edition only

Message Queuing is not supported on Windows XP Home Edition. If you
are upgrading from Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium
Edition computers running MSMQ version 1.0, consider upgrading your
computer to Windows XP Professional.

         Planning Your Microsoft Whistler Server Installation
                   Release Notes, Part 2 of 3

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

======================================================================
8.0   Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems each time you restart the computer. For example, you
could set up a server to run Whistler Server most of the time but
allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server version 4.0 in order to
support an older application. (However, to do this you would need to
make specific file system choices and would probably need the latest
released Service Pack, as described in "Multiple Operating Systems and
File System Compatibility" and "Choosing a File System" later in this
text file series.) During restart, you can select which of the two
operating systems you want to run. (You can specify a default 
operating system that will run if no selection is made during the 
restart process.)

Important: If you set up a computer so that the installed operating 
systems include Whistler and any other operating system, you must 
install Whistler in a separate partition on the computer. (A partition 
divides a disk into sections that function as separate units and that 
can be formatted for use by a file system. Different partitions often 
have different drive letters, for example, C and D.) Installing 
Whistler in a separate partition ensures that it will not overwrite 
crucial files used by the other operating system.

The reason for setting up a computer so that you can choose between
two or more operating systems at startup is that you can use 
applications that run only with a particular operating system. There
are definite drawbacks to setting up a computer this way, however:
each operating system uses valuable disk space, and compatibility
issues, especially file system compatibility, can be complex. In
addition, you cannot use dynamic disks (a storage type available in
Whistler) with some operating systems. The only operating systems that
can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.

Note: If you are considering setting up a computer with more than one 
operating system to ensure that you will always have a way to start 
the computer (regardless of driver or disk problems), first take into 
account the variety of disaster-recovery features available in 
Whistler. One example of these features is safe mode, in which 
Whistler restarts with default settings and the minimum number of 
drivers (ensuring the ability to start even if a new driver is causing 
a problem). With this and a variety of other disaster-recovery 
features, it is not necessary to maintain more than one operating 
system as a safeguard against system problems. Avoiding multiple 
operating systems means you also avoid file system compatibility 
issues and other drawbacks. For more information about disaster 
recovery, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click
Help and Support.

Before deciding to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain MS-DOS and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system in a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system in the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it in two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT.

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 95 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT. (For Windows 95
   OSR2, the primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.)

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 95. 

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 98 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 98. 

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler:

 * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" and
   "Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Server"
   later in this text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 2000 and Whistler or that contain
multiple Whistler partitions:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * When installing Whistler on a partition, you can choose any
   product in the Whistler product family. For example, for a
   computer containing multiple Whistler partitions, you could
   install Whistler Server on one partition and Whistler
   Professional on another.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS), you must take
   certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be available
   from each of the installations. For more information,
   see "Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System"
   later in this text file series.

8.1   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
======================================================================

On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it supports
important features, including Active Directory and domain-based
security. With NTFS, however, you need to take file system
compatibility into account when considering whether to set up a
computer to contain more than one operating system, because the
version of NTFS in Windows 2000 and Whistler has new features in
addition to those in Windows NT. Files that use any new features will
be completely usable or readable only when the computer is started
with Windows 2000 or Whistler. For example, a file that uses the new
encryption feature won't be readable when the computer is started with
Windows NT Server 4.0, which was released before the encryption
feature existed. For more information about features that affect file
accessibility with Whistler, see "NTFS" later in this text file
series.

Note: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT and 
Whistler, and you want to have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate 
version of Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released Service 
Pack. Using the latest Service Pack maximizes compatibility between 
Windows NT 4.0 and the updated NTFS file system used with Whistler 
Server. (Specifically, this compatibility in file systems is provided 
by Service Pack 4 and later Service Packs.) Even the latest Service 
Pack, however, does not provide access to files using the new features 
in NTFS. Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that 
contains both Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. On these 
computers, a FAT partition containing the Windows NT 4.0 operating 
system ensures that when started with Windows NT 4.0, the computer 
will have access to needed files.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Whistler Server is contained in an 
NTFS partition, when that computer starts with Windows NT 3.51, the 
NTFS partition will not be visible.

8.2   Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Server
======================================================================

Before you set up a computer that contains Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler 
Server, review the following precautions:

 * If your only concern is ensuring that you can always start the
   computer, setting up the computer so that you can start it with
   different operating systems at different times is not necessary.
   For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
   Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
   file series.

 * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
   Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. For more
   information, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
   Compatibility" earlier in this text file series.

 * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
   released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
   Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   When you perform a new installation of Whistler Server (as opposed
   to an upgrade), by default, the installation is placed on a
   partition on which no other operating system is located. You can
   specify a different partition during Setup.

 * Don't install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the drive was
   compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation.

For more information about computers that contain multiple operating
systems, see the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kits.

8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System
======================================================================

If you set up a server so that it contains Windows 2000 and Whistler
or contains multiple Whistler partitions, and you want to use 
Encrypting File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain
steps. These steps make encrypted files readable between the different
installations.

 * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
   same domain and that the user of these installations has a
   roaming profile.

 * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

======================================================================
9.0   Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

There is one situation in which you might want to choose FAT or FAT32
as your file system. If it is necessary to have a computer that will
sometimes run Whistler and sometimes run Windows NT or an earlier
operating system, you will need to have a FAT or FAT32 partition as
the primary (or startup) partition on the hard disk. This is because
these earlier operating systems, with one exception, can't access a
partition if it uses the latest version of NTFS. The one exception is
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later, which has access
to partitions with the latest version of NTFS, but with some
limitations. Windows NT 4.0 cannot access files that have been stored
using NTFS features that did not exist when Windows NT 4.0 was
released. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
Contain More Than One Operating System" and "Multiple Operating
Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
series.

For anything other than a situation with multiple operating systems,
however, the recommended file system is NTFS.

The following list describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems. 

 * NTFS: A computer running Windows 2000 or Whistler can access files
   on an NTFS partition. A computer running Windows NT 4.0 with
   Service Pack 4 or later might be able to access some files.
   Other operating systems allow no access.

 * FAT: Access is available through MS-DOS, all versions of Windows,
   Windows NT, Whistler, and OS/2.

 * FAT32: Access is available only through Windows 95 OSR2, Windows
   98, Windows 2000, and Whistler.

The following list compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.

 * NTFS: Recommended minimum volume size is approximately 10 MB.
   Recommended practical maximum for volumes is 2 TB (terabytes). 
   Much larger sizes are possible.
   Cannot be used on floppy disks.
   File size limited only by size of volume.

 * FAT: Volumes from floppy disk size up to 4 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 2 GB.

 * FAT32: Volumes from 512 MB to 2 TB.
   In Whistler, you can format a FAT32 volume only up to 32 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 4 GB.

Note: If you choose to format a partition as FAT during Setup and the 
partition is larger than 2 GB, Setup will automatically format it as 
FAT32.

9.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some of the features you can use when you choose NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory, and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in Whistler.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new
version of NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of
conversion keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition).
Setup begins by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS,
conversion happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives
you the choice of whether to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to
keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT 
or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but 
a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.

======================================================================
10.0   Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations
======================================================================

You will need to plan your disk partitions before running Setup only
if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. Disk
partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a
disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different partitions
often have different drive letters (for example, C and D). A
primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you can
install the files needed to load an operating system such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
(Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.)

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition size. The
basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating system,
applications, and other files that you might group together on the
installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler Server
require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as described
in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series. You should 
allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. Allowing 
2-4 GB on the partition is not unreasonable, and for larger 
installations, it is not unreasonable to allow 10 GB. This allows 
space for a variety of items, including optional components, user 
accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future service packs, 
the pagefile used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Server, you can
select the partition on which to install. If you specify a partition
on which another operating system exists, you will be prompted to
confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. (Note that you cannot use dynamic disks on some computers
that contain multiple operating systems. The only operating systems
that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.)

Important: If you're setting up a computer so that it contains 
multiple operating systems, you must install Whistler on its own 
partition. This ensures that Whistler will not overwrite crucial files 
needed by the other operating system. For more information, see 
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating 
System" earlier in this text file series.

10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (2 GB of space is recommended, but you might need less,
depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, you can plan
to make the disk a dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the
use of the disk space than a basic disk. (However, you cannot use
dynamic disks on some computers that contain multiple operating
systems. The only operating systems that can access a dynamic disk are
Windows 2000 and Whistler.)

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.

======================================================================
11.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

The following list describes the components in the preceding table 
and all other components that you can install.

Accessories and Utilities
  Includes desktop accessories such as WordPad, Paint, Calculator, 
  and CD Player, as well as the Accessibility Wizard. To select 
  individual items, in the Windows Components Wizard, select 
  Accessories and Utilities, click Details, and then select the 
  subcomponents you want from the list.

Certificate Services
  Provides security and authentication support, including secure 
  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, you can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, and
  management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation of 
  phone books that can be automatically updated from a central server. 
  In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes Simple 
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management 
  Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool 
  for creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications 
  can communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers 
  that might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional 
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networking, including the items 
  in the following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, 
  see "Networking: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later 
  in this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug
     and Play devices so that you can use them immediately, without
     additional configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     access servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating system,
  as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target clients
  must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot eXecution
  Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with a remote-start
  floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate partition for
  Remote Installation Services. For more information, see "Disk
  Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" earlier in
  this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications on
  the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal emulator
  on the client. Each user sees an individual session, displayed as a
  Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by the server,
  independent of any other client session. If you install Terminal
  Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing on at least
  one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you install 
  Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued for 
  clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued 
  for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content using
  Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.

======================================================================
12.0   Networking: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. (For information about using other network adapters, read the
adapter documentation, and see "Taking an Optional Device Inventory"
earlier in this text file series.) Setup and the Configure Your Server
Wizard are designed to make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the
services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more information.

12.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
Static addressing, or both. For more information about DHCP and IP 
addressing, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Server feature called
   Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign
   IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the
   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and 
   WINS are described in the following section, "Name Resolution for 
   TCP/IP." One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, 
   and/or WINS. Any server providing these services should be assigned 
   a static IP address (so other computers can locate it). For 
   detailed information about assigning a static IP address, see 
   "Specifying Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

12.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

12.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required in domains with
clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is installed
automatically when you create a domain controller (or promote a server
to become a domain controller), unless the Whistler software detects
that a DNS server already exists for that domain. (Alternatively, you
can explicitly select DNS as a component to install during or after
Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

12.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any earlier
Microsoft operating system, you will need to install Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. WINS is an
optional software component and appears under Networking Services in
the list of installable Windows components. (For more information
about different ways you can install components during or after Setup,
see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text
file series.) If you are installing WINS on a server, you will need to
specify a static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need
to configure the WINS clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

======================================================================
13.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a single,
centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network
details. The information in this database is replicated automatically
among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain
controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You can
determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

13.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running
Setup, and change server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain controllers,
see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

13.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

1.0   Preparing Your System for an Upgrade
======================================================================

This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for an upgrade.

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Help for the operating system that you are 
running.

1.2   Reviewing Hardware and Software
======================================================================

When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process Setup carries
out is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along with
the information in Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility 
section of Readme.doc (in the root directory of the Whistler CD), to 
determine whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or 
software before upgrading. If you use an Internet service provider 
(ISP), pay special attention to any recommendations about updating the 
ISP software necessary for your Internet connectivity.

1.3   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before upgrading, you should back up your current files. You can back 
up files to a disk, a tape drive, or another computer on your network.

1.4   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before upgrading to
Whistler. Do not upgrade to Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

1.5   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for Upgrade 
(Windows NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you are upgrading a computer from Windows NT 4.0 and it has a
mirror set, volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare
for the upgrade as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror.

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After the upgrade, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up
data as needed, and make use of the variety of volume options (such as
mirrored volumes) available with dynamic disks. For more information
about dynamic disks, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

1.6   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.

======================================================================
2.0   Preparing Your System for a New Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take to prepare your server
for a new installation. 

2.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system that you
are running.

2.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you perform a new installation of Whistler Server, you should 
back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the 
current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up 
files to a variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard 
disks of other computers on the network.

2.3   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing
Whistler. Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

2.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a clean installation on a computer that
currently runs Windows NT 4.0, and it has a mirror set, volume set,
stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare for the installation as
follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror. 

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After installation is complete, you can make the disk dynamic,
restore backed-up data as needed, and make use of the variety of
volume options (such as mirrored volumes) available with dynamic
disks. For more information about dynamic disks, see Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing 
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

2.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.

======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series.

How you start Setup depends on whether you are upgrading or
performing a new installation, as described in the following sections.
Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs. Full online help (called Help and Support Services) is
available when the Configure Your Server Wizard appears. To open
Help and Support Services, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

3.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

3.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Server CD.
This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at 
http://www.microsoft.com/) lists only the devices for which drivers 
are included on the Whistler Server CD. If your controller is not 
listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you through supplying the driver 
file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage 
controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

3.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

3.2   Starting Setup for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading to Whistler, you can start Setup from the CD
or from a network. For information about the versions of Windows from
which you can upgrade, see "Upgrading" earlier in this text file
series.

For information about starting Setup for a new installation,
see "Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer"
or "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series. For information about unattended Setup and other options
available when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
later in this text file series.

>>> To start an upgrade from the CD on a computer running Windows:

1. Insert the CD in the drive and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start an upgrade from a network:

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD"
and "Starting a New Installation from a Network," provide procedures 
for starting Setup for a new installation. For information about 
starting Setup for an upgrade, see the previous section.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

3.3.1   Starting a New Installation from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Whistler CD for running Setup, you have several options 
for starting Setup.

Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or 
MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the setup 
process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. The usual
way to enable disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS 
is to use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the 
documentation for WINDOWS 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running MS-DOS:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. At the command prompt, type

   d:

   where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type

   cd i386

4. Type

   winnt

5. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 3.x:

1. Using File Manager, change to the CD-ROM drive.

2. Change to the I386 folder.

3. Double-click Winnt.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD. This method applies only if you want to perform a new
installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform an
installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

>>> To start Setup and perform a new installation by starting an x86-based computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3.2   Starting a New Installation from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Find and run the appropriate file on the I386 folder of the CD
   or in the shared folder:

   * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

   * From a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
     Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler,
     run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

======================================================================
4.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer," earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition.

Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID partition table 
(GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based editions of 
Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based computer must 
be GPT. You can still read and write to master boot record (MBR) 
volumes, which are common to most computers, but you cannot install on 
one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based computers and 
Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler only. Dynamic 
GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based computers running the 
Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

======================================================================
5.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions
automatically. Then, run Setup from the command line; that is, 
run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for
unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system
that is running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
   Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?

======================================================================
6.0   Entering Server Settings for a New Installation
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.
If you have specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer
manufacturer, see "Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
File" earlier in this text file.

6.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During a new installation, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to
create or specify a partition on which you want to install Whistler.
You can create a partition from the unpartitioned space available,
specify an existing partition, or delete an existing partition to
create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition. If
you specify any action that will cause information to be erased, you
will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions for New
Installations" earlier in this text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Performing a new installation of 
Whistler on a partition that contains another operating system will 
cause that operating system to be overwritten.

6.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

6.3   Personalizing Whistler Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

6.4   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" earlier in this text file
series. If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because
you can change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

6.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you can
use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters and
other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of network software from other companies on your network. For more information about DNS,
see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 
2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name 
only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will be part of a domain and will use more than one operating system,
you must use a different computer name with each of the operating
systems installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT
when it is started with Windows NT Server 4.0, it would need to have a
different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is started with
Whistler Server. This requirement also applies to a computer that
will start with either of two different installations of Whistler.

6.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters, and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important:  For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

6.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

6.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

6.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other protocols) 
during Setup, or you can select the Typical settings option and then 
make any necessary changes to your networking configuration after
installation, by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Server feature called Automatic Private IP
   Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP addresses. After
   completing Setup, you can continue to use automatically assigned
   addresses or configure DHCP, static IP addresses, or both. To
   open Whistler Help and Support Services (which includes information 
   about DHCP and static IP addresses), after completing Setup, click 
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain, by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at
   least initially, as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS:

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

6.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.

======================================================================
7.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Server and use Configure 
Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support Services is New ways to do familiar 
tasks, available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and 
Support Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration
tools are also available from Administrative Tools.

Server Wizard. Together, Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard 
help you get your servers up and running quickly. To find out more 
about the Configure Your Server Wizard, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen
hardware that supports Whistler Advanced Server.

1.1   System Requirements
======================================================================

To ensure adequate performance, the computers on which you
will install Whistler Advanced Server must meet the following 
requirements:

 * Pentium or higher central processing unit (CPU). 

   * On x86-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 233 
     MHz, with a recommended speed of 550 MHz.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum CPU speed supported is 
     800 MHz. 

 * A maximum of 8 CPUs per computer are supported.

 * RAM:

   * On x86-based computers, 256 MB of RAM is recommended, while the
     minimum amount of RAM required is 128 MB and the maximum is 
     32 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, the minimum amount of RAM required is
     1 GB. 

   For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, see the Hardware
   Compatibility List (HCL), described in "Hardware Compatibility"
   later in this text file series. 

 * Hard disk partition: the minimum amount of space required is 
   approximately 1 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the 
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

     In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows NT 4.0
     could require much more space than a new installation, because
     the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as
     a factor of ten during the upgrade as Active Directory
     functionality is added.

     Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in 
     The previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard 
     disk space used for the operating system (excluding user 
     accounts) is usually less than the free space required for Setup, 
     depending on the system components installed.

   For additional information about planning the sizes of disk
   partitions, including information about creating a separate 
   partition for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning 
   Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this text 
   file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL. The HCL is described in the following section,
   "Hardware Compatibility."

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the setup files.

1.2   Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Whistler Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and
reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful installation,
however, check to make sure your computer hardware is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server before running Setup.

To do this, see the Whistler Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). If
your hardware is not listed, Setup might not be successful. (Note that
one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.)

To see the version of the HCL that was released with Whistler, on the
Whistler CD, in the Support folder, open Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-
date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List 
by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/

In addition, check that you have updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based
computer) or Extensible Firmware Interface (for an Itanium-based
computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these
items. For more information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see
"Understanding ACPI BIOS" later in this text file series.

Finally, before installing Whistler Advanced Server, consider taking
a device inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more
information, see the following section.

1.3   Taking an Optional Device Inventory
======================================================================

To ensure smooth functioning of your adapters and other devices in
your computer, be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware
Compatibility" earlier in this text file series. For specific
information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI,
RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the
manufacturer, see "Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File"
later in this text file series.

Whistler includes Plug and Play technology so that devices (for
example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized
by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you
do not have to specify each device's settings by hand. However, if you
have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your
Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards,
you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts.
This section describes the steps you can take, if you choose, to
understand your device configuration before running Setup.

To better understand the configuration of the devices in your
computer, take an inventory. To do this, if your computer has an
existing operating system, use it to obtain the current settings, such
as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices.
For example, with Windows NT 4.0, you can use Control Panel to view
settings (on the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel,
and then double-click icons such as Network and Ports). You might also
choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen
while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when
prompted.

During Setup, Whistler automatically takes a device inventory as
well. However, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following
difficulties:

 * If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses,
   Whistler might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent
   this, you can take one of two approaches.

   You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and 
   re-install it afterward. For more information about hardware and 
   configuration, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
   and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
   click Help and Support.

   Alternatively, you can modify one adapter's IRQ settings and
   memory addresses before running Setup so that each adapter's
   settings are unique.

 * If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by
   Whistler to detect or enumerate them, Whistler might receive
   indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you
   might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and 
   re-install and configure them afterward. For more information 
   about hardware and for configuration guidance, see Whistler Help 
   and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
   completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

The following table lists the kinds of information to gather before
starting Setup.

ADAPTER               INFORMATION TO GATHER
-------------         -----------------------------------------------
Video                 Adapter or chip set type and how many video 
                      adapters

                      slots

1.3.1   Understanding ACPI BIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For x86-based computers, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a
set of software through which the operating system (or Setup)
communicates with the computer's hardware devices. The Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for
the way the BIOS works. Whistler supports not only ACPI-compliant BIOS
versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power
management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.

Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard.
The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it
is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI
standard might not support workable communication between the
operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable
communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions
for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to
solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions that 
appear on your screen.

To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:

 * For information about which ACPI-based BIOS versions are 
   ACPI-compliant, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for
   Whistler. This is the definitive source for this information.
   For information about the HCL, see "Hardware Compatibility"
   earlier in this text file series.

 * For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup,
   restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay
   particular attention to blocks of text containing the words
   "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS."

 * For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, see your
   hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.


======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup,
familiarize yourself with important files found on the root directory
of the Whistler Advanced Server CD:

 * Read1st.txt  Contains critical preinstallation notes vital to the
                success of your installation.

 * Readme.doc   Contains important usage information about hardware,
                networks, applications, and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for Whistler
Advanced Server. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility"
earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
3.0   Deciding Whether to Upgrade or Install
======================================================================

After you have reviewed "System Requirements," "Hardware
Compatibility," and "Important Files to Review" earlier in this text
file series, and before you run Whistler Advanced Server Setup, you
will need to determine whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation. Upgrading is replacing a version of Windows NT or
Windows 2000 with Whistler Advanced Server. Installing, in contrast
to upgrading, means wiping out the previous operating system, or
installing Whistler Advanced Server on a disk or disk partition with
no previous operating system.

Note: Do not upgrade to or install Whistler on a compressed drive 
Unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression 
utility. Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume before running 
Whistler Setup on it.

If you have already decided whether to upgrade or to perform a new
installation, see the following sections later in this text file
series:

 * For an upgrade: see "Decisions to Make for an Upgrade."

 * For a new installation: see "Decisions to Make for a New
   Installation."

There are several reasons to choose to upgrade. (To determine whether
your old operating system is a version from which you can upgrade, see
the following section, "Upgrading.") Configuration is simpler, and 
your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are
retained. In addition, files and applications do not need to be 
re-installed. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, 
you should back up the disk before running Setup.

It is possible to install Whistler Advanced Server and also allow the
computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the
computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file
system issues. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this text file
series.

3.1   Upgrading
======================================================================

If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Whistler into the same
folder as the currently installed operating system. You can upgrade 
to Whistler Advanced Server from the following versions of Windows:

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

 * Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition

 * Windows 2000 Server

 * Windows 2000 Advanced Server

If your computer is running Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, 
you can upgrade to Whistler Advanced Server, but not Whistler Server.

Note: If you are running a version of Windows NT earlier than 4.0, you cannot upgrade directly to Whistler from it. You must first upgrade to Windows NT Server 4.0.

3.2   Installing
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a new installation, note that:

 * For a new installation on a disk partition that contains
   applications you want to keep, you must back up the applications 
   and re-install them after installing Whistler Advanced Server.

 * If you want to perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server on a partition that previously contained Whistler
   Advanced Server, and if you want to keep any documents saved in the 
   My Documents folder, back them up before beginning the 
   installation. You can use Search to find the documents. After 
   completing the new installation, you can copy the documents back to 
   the My Documents folder.


======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, and you have a Windows NT 4.0 domain, you will
need to decide on the order of server upgrades. For more information,
see the following sections later in this text file series:

 * "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers
   First"

 * "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers
   First"

In addition, if you are upgrading from Windows NT 4.0, you will need
to decide whether to convert the file system, on any FAT or FAT32
partitions you might have, to the NTFS file system. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.


======================================================================
5.0   Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

Domains are an important feature of Windows servers and clients. A
domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a single
domain name and security boundary. It is necessary to have one or more
domains if you want to use domain-based user accounts and other domain
security features in Whistler. (This was true for Windows NT and
Windows 2000 as well.) 

On computers running Whistler, servers can have one of three roles in 
relation to domains:

 * Domain controllers contain matching copies of the user accounts
   and other Active Directory data in a given domain.

 * Member servers belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the
   Active Directory data.

 * Stand-alone servers belong to a workgroup rather than a domain.

A domain must have at least one domain controller. For resilience, a
domain should have multiple domain controllers to support the handling
of logon requests and directory updates.

Before running Setup, you should plan the roles that your servers will 
Have within domains in Whistler. However, you can still adjust these 
roles after completing Setup.

There are a number of important points to remember about upgrading an
existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to run with Whistler:

 * You must use the NTFS file system on domain controllers. In
   addition, any servers that have any partition formatted with FAT
   or FAT32 will lack many security features. For example, on FAT
   or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by
   the permissions set on the share, not on individual files, and
   there is no software protection against local access to the
   partition.

 * If you want to upgrade a server and then use the same applications
   as before, be sure to read about application compatibility.

   One important source of application compatibility information is
   Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility section of Readme.doc 
   (in the root directory of the Whistler CD). For more information
   about these files, see "Important Files to Review" earlier in
   this text file series.

 * You can upgrade member servers before or after upgrading domain
   controllers. However, when you upgrade the domain controllers in
   a Windows NT domain to Whistler, you must upgrade the primary
   domain controller first.

 * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
   access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it before 
   the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a server is dependent 
   on domain controllers for user information and therefore should not 
   be "left behind" when domain controllers are upgraded. As an 
   alternative, you can weakendecrease the security permissions on 
   Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows 
   NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. 
   For more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
   Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

The roles of the servers in a domain are named somewhat differently
by computers running Whistler Advanced Server as compared with those 
running Windows NT. On computers running Windows NT, the possible 
roles were primary domain controller (limited to one per domain), 
backup domain controller, member server, or stand-alone server. 
Whistler has only one kind of domain controller (without a
"primary" or "backup" designation), and it includes the roles of
member server and stand-alone server. When you upgrade, Setup assigns
server roles as follows:

ROLE IN WINDOWS NT DOMAIN   ROLE IN WHISTLER DOMAIN
--------------------------  ---------------------------------------
Primary domain controller   Domain controller

Backup domain controller    Your choice of domain controller or
                            member server

Member server               Member server

Stand-alone server          Stand-alone server


5.1   Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain
======================================================================

When planning the order of server upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0
domain, there are two somewhat different approaches to choose between: 
upgrading the domain controllers first, or upgrading the member 
servers first. You can mix these approaches. However, if you have a 
Windows NT domain and you want to begin upgrading domain controllers, 
you must upgrade the primary domain controller first.

If you upgrade member servers first (without upgrading domain
controllers), a variety of features become available, but none that
require Active Directory. Once you begin upgrading domain controllers,
Active Directory features become available.

For additional information about planning the order of server
upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 domain, see the following:

 * For background information about server roles (which you must
   understand to plan the order of server upgrades), see "Upgrading
   an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * For more detailed information about upgrading domains, or
   information about upgrading domains with more than five servers,
   see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, Deployment 
   Planning Guide."

 * For information about how to carry out each kind of upgrade, see
   "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain
   Controllers First" or "Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by
   Upgrading Member Servers First" later in this text file series.

The lists in "Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0
Domain Controllers" and "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain," later in this text file series, show the
features that are available with each approach to upgrading servers.

5.1.1   Features Available with Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 Domain 
Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When Windows NT domain controllers are upgraded and begin
communicating on a network, all the features of Whistler become
available through these servers. Of these features, the Active
Directory features are listed in this section, and a number of other
features are listed in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server
in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Note: The features available when domain controllers are upgraded 
include not only the features in the following list, but also the 
features in "Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a 
Windows NT 4.0 Domain" later in this text file series.

Active Directory includes the following features:

 * Simplified management of network-resource information and user
   information.

 * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
   a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active
   Directory.

 * Security and authentication features, including support for
   Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer V3, and Transport Layer
   Security using X.509v3 certificates.

 * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
   simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
   devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
   they need. You can take advantage of synchronization support
   through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) and work with directory consolidation
   requirements specific to your applications.

 * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make 
   it easier to configure and manage applications and other 
   directory-enabled network components.

 * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
   scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
   technology and advanced replication techniques to speed
   performance.

 * Use of Internet standards, including access through LDAP and a 
   namespace based on the Domain Name System (DNS).

 * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful development
   environment.

 * Additional features.

5.1.2   Features Available with Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows 
NT 4.0 Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The features in the following list are available when member servers
are upgraded in a Windows NT domain, regardless of whether domain
controllers have been upgraded. The features available when domain
controllers are upgraded include not only the features in the
following list, but also the features in the previous one.

 * Management tools:
   Microsoft Management Console
   Plug and Play
   Device Manager
   Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
   Support for universal serial bus
   Enhanced Backup utility

 * File system support: The version of NTFS in Whistler includes
   support for disk quotas, the ability to defragment directory
   structures, and compressed network I/O.

 * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and Windows
   Script Host.

 * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
   choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
   enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
   Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
   over an intranet or the Internet.

 * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
   support as compared to Windows NT.

 * Security: Encrypting file system.

5.2   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. If you are not sure which approach you want to take,
see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file series.

If you upgrade your Windows NT domain by upgrading the domain
controllers first, the upgrade has the following three stages:

 * Carrying out backups and other preparations so you can restore the
   previous installation if necessary.

 * Upgrading the primary domain controller. You must do this before
   upgrading any backup domain controllers.

 * Upgrading other servers in the domain.

This section describes the actions to take for these stages. For a
more in-depth discussion of planning the upgrade of domain
controllers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide." For information about what versions of 
Windows NT can be upgraded to Whistler Advanced Server, see 
"Upgrading" earlier in this text file series.

5.2.1   Backups and Other Preparations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your 
servers, you should back up each server before upgrading it. Also, be 
sure to review "Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this 
text file series.

In addition, to safeguard your existing network integrity, you might
consider removing a backup domain controller temporarily from a
network. To do this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a
backup domain controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the
user accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
cable. After upgrading your primary domain controller to Whistler (you
must upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
controller if needed. However, in the course of a successful upgrade,
you would not and could not promote the Windows NT backup domain
controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would continue
the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the disconnected server
and upgrading it.

Also, for any computer that will be a domain controller in the
Whistler domain, make sure that there is plenty of free space on the 
disk, beyond the space needed for the operating system itself. (For
information about the disk requirements for the operating system, see
"System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.) When Setup
upgrades the user accounts database from the format used by Windows NT
to the format used by Whistler Advanced Server, the database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten.

5.2.2   Upgrading Servers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first domain controller to be upgraded in a Windows NT domain
must be the primary domain controller. As you upgrade this server, you
will be given the choices of creating a new domain or a child domain,
and of creating a new forest or a domain tree in an existing forest.
For the upgrading of a domain of two to five servers (which is the
size of domains discussed in this text file series), create a new
domain and a new forest. For information about domain structures to
use with larger numbers of servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three important
items: the database containing user accounts and other Active
Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (SYSVOL) folder.
The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition (FAT,
FAT32, or NTFS). The database can expand by as much as a factor of ten
from the size it was in Windows NT, so allow plenty of room for it.
(Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The SYSVOL 
folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information about
NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System" later in
this text file series.)

After the primary domain controller is upgraded to a Whistler domain
controller, it will be fully backward-compatible. This means that the
domain controller appears as a Whistler domain controller to Whistler
servers and clients, but emulates a Windows NT 4.0 primary domain
controller to Windows NT 4.0 servers and clients.

After upgrading your primary domain controller and ensuring that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, upgrade any backup domain
controllers next. (If possible, it is best to begin the upgrades soon,
rather than allowing a long delay.) Also, if you are running a remote 
access server that is a member server, you should upgrade it
before the last domain controller is upgraded. A remote-access member
server is dependent on domain controllers for user information and
therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers are
upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security permissions
on Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows
NT can read user attributes from the Whistler domain controllers. For
more information, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

Note: When the second domain controller is upgraded, it copies the 
first (formerly the primary) domain controller. Therefore, be sure 
that the first domain controller is running and available on the 
network as you upgrade the second. Similarly, be sure that at least 
one Whistler domain controller is available on the network when you 
upgrade the third, fourth, and any remaining Windows NT domain 
controllers.

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Start and test each server on the
network to ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction before
upgrading another backup domain controller.

When you have completely upgraded all domain controllers to Whistler
domain controllers, you have the option of changing the domain from
mixed mode (where Windows NT domain controllers can exist in the
domain) to native mode (where only Whistler domain controllers can
exist in the domain). This is an important decision, because you
cannot revert to mixed mode after changing to native mode.

For information about domain trees, mixed mode, native mode, or any
other item related to domains, see the topics under Active Directory 
in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support 
Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support. For information about performing upgrades in domains larger 
than two to five servers, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
Resource Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

5.3   Upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Member Servers 
First
======================================================================

You can upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by taking one of two general
approaches: upgrading domain controllers first or member servers
first. For information about the advantages and disadvantages of each
approach, see "Planning the Order of Server Upgrades in a Windows NT
4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file series.

Note: If you have a remote access server that is a member server, and 
you have begun upgrading any domain controllers, be sure to read 
"Upgrading Servers" earlier in this text file series.

Before upgrading any server, be sure to back it up, and review 
"Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" later in this text file series.

If you upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 domain by upgrading member servers
first, you can upgrade one, a few, or all of the member servers at a
given time. Choose the order of the upgrades by considering which of
your servers would be most improved by the features in the Whistler
Server family. For information about the features available when
member servers are upgraded, see "Features Available with Upgrade of
Any Server in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file
series.

After upgrading member servers in a domain, when you are ready to
upgrade domain controllers, follow the instructions in "Upgrading a
Windows NT 4.0 Domain by Upgrading Domain Controllers First" earlier
in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic decisions you will need to make
if you have decided to perform a new installation. Each area is
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. You will need 
to consider the following:

6.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

6.2   Whether You Want to Be Able to Choose Between Different 
Operating Systems Each Time You Start the Computer
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" later in this text file series.

6.3   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. You should 
use NTFS because it is the only file system that supports Active
Directory, which includes many important features such as domains and
domain-based security. However, it might be necessary to have a FAT or
FAT32 partition in situations where you must set up a computer so that
it sometimes runs Whistler and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or an
earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System" later in this text file series.

6.4   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a 
New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

If you are performing a new installation, you will need to review
your disk partitions before running Setup (for an upgrade, you will
use existing partitions). A partition divides a disk into one or more
areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). After running Setup, you can modify the partitioning of the disk.
For information about planning the partitions for a new installation,
see "Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations" later in this
text file series.

6.5   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Advanced Server. You can install these components
during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the Configure
Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components for you
according to the type of server you specify. For more information
about components, see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this
text file series.

6.6   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

6.7   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Upgrading an Existing Windows NT 4.0 Domain" earlier
in this text file series and "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, 
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Advanced Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

     Planning Your Microsoft Whistler Advanced Server Installation
                     Release Notes, Part 2 of 4
                              Beta 2

**********************************************************************

         (c) 2001 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.


These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.


======================================================================
8.0   Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems each time you restart the computer. For example, you
could set up a server to run Whistler Advanced Server most of the time
but allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise 
Edition in order to support an older application. (However, to do this 
you would need to make specific file system choices and would probably 
need the latest released Service Pack, as described in "Multiple 
Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" and "Choosing a File 
System" later in this text file series.) During restart, you can 
select which of the two operating systems you want to run. (You can 
specify a default operating system that will run if no selection is 
made during the restart process.)

Important: If you set up a computer so that the installed operating systems include Whistler and any other operating system, you must 
Install Whistler in a separate partition on the computer. (A partition 
divides a disk into sections that function as separate units and
that can be formatted for use by a file system. Different
partitions often have different drive letters, for example, C and
D). Installing Whistler in a separate partition ensures that it will
not overwrite crucial files used by the other operating system.

The reason for setting up a computer so that you can choose between
two or more operating systems at startup is that you can use
applications that run only with a particular operating system. There
are definite drawbacks to setting up a computer this way, however:
each operating system uses valuable disk space, and compatibility
issues, especially file system compatibility, can be complex. In
addition, you cannot use dynamic disks (a storage type available in
Whistler) with some operating systems. The only operating systems that
can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.

Note: If you are considering setting up a computer with more than one
operating system to ensure that you will always have a way to
start the computer (regardless of driver or disk problems), first
take into account the variety of disaster-recovery features
available in Whistler. One example of these features is safe mode,
in which Whistler restarts with default settings and the minimum
number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even if a new
driver is causing a problem). With this and a variety of other
disaster-recovery features, it is not necessary to maintain more
than one operating system as a safeguard against system problems.
Avoiding multiple operating systems means you also avoid 
file system compatibility issues and other drawbacks. For more
information about disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

Before deciding to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain MS-DOS and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system in a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system in the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it in two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT.

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 95 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT. (For Windows 95
   OSR2, the primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.)

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 95. 

 * Whistler must be installed last. Otherwise important files needed
   for starting Whistler could be overwritten.

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 98 and Whistler:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * The primary partition must be formatted as FAT or FAT32.

 * Compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes won't be available
   while you are running Whistler. It is not necessary to
   uncompress DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes that you will
   access only with Windows 98. 

 * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
   Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
   text file series.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler:

 * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" 
   and "Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced
   Server" later in this text file series.

On computers that contain Windows 2000 and Whistler or that contain
multiple Whistler partitions:

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * When installing Whistler on a partition, you can choose any
   product in the Whistler product family. For example, for a
   computer containing multiple Whistler partitions, you could
   install Whistler Advanced Server on one partition and Whistler
   Professional on another.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS), you must take
   certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be available
   from each of the installations. For more information,
   see "Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System"
   later in this text file series.

8.1   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
======================================================================

On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. For more
information, see "Choosing a File System" later in this text file
series.

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it supports
important features, including Active Directory and domain-based
security. With NTFS, however, you need to take file system
compatibility into account when considering whether to set up a
computer to contain more than one operating system, because the
version of NTFS in Windows 2000 and Whistler has new features in
addition to those in Windows NT. Files that use any new features will
be completely usable or readable only when the computer is started
with Windows 2000 or Whistler. For example, a file that uses the new
encryption feature won't be readable when the computer is started with
Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, which were
released before the encryption feature existed. For more information
about features that affect file accessibility with Whistler, see
"NTFS" later in this text file series.

Note: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT and 
Whistler, and you want to have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate
version of Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released
Service Pack. Using the latest Service Pack maximizes
compatibility between Windows NT 4.0 and the updated NTFS file
system used with Whistler Advanced Server. (Specifically, this
compatibility in file systems is provided by Service Pack 4 and
later Service Packs.) Even the latest Service Pack, however, does
not provide access to files using the new features in NTFS.
Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. On these computers, a
FAT partition containing the Windows NT 4.0 operating system
ensures that when started with Windows NT 4.0, the computer will
have access to needed files.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Whistler Advanced Server on an NTFS
partition, when that computer starts with Windows NT 3.51, the NTFS
partition will not be visible.

8.2   Computers that Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Before you set up a computer that contains Windows NT 4.0
and Whistler Advanced Server, review the following precautions:

 * If your only concern is ensuring that you can always start the
   computer, setting up the computer so that you can start it with
   different operating systems at different times is not necessary.
   For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
   Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
   file series.

 * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
   Whistler and Windows NT is not recommended. For more
   information, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
   Compatibility" earlier in this text file series.

 * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
   released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
   Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
   series.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced
   Server (as opposed to an upgrade), by default, the installation
   is placed on a partition on which no other operating system is
   located. You can specify a different partition during Setup.

 * Don't install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the drive was
   compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation.

For more information about computers that contain multiple operating
systems, see the Windows 2000 Resource Kits.

8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and Encrypting File System
======================================================================

If you set up a server so that it contains Windows 2000 and Whistler
or contains multiple Whistler partitions, and you want to use Encrypting File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain
steps. These steps make encrypted files readable between the different
installations.

 * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
   same domain and that the user of these installations has a
   roaming profile.

 * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

There is one situation in which you might want to choose FAT or FAT32
as your file system. If it is necessary to have a computer that will
sometimes run Whistler and sometimes run Windows NT or an earlier
operating system, you will need to have a FAT or FAT32 partition as
the primary (or startup) partition on the hard disk. This is because
these earlier operating systems, with one exception, can't access a
partition if it uses the latest version of NTFS. The one exception is
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later, which has access
to partitions with the latest version of NTFS, but with some
limitations. Windows NT 4.0 cannot access files that have been stored
using NTFS features that did not exist when Windows NT 4.0 was
released. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will
Contain More Than One Operating System" and "Multiple Operating
Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file
series.

For anything other than a situation with multiple operating systems,
however, the recommended file system is NTFS.

The following list describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems. 

 * NTFS: A computer running Windows 2000 or Whistler can access files
   on an NTFS partition. A computer running Windows NT 4.0 with
   Service Pack 4 or later might be able to access some files.
   Other operating systems allow no access.

 * FAT: Access is available through MS-DOS, all versions of Windows,
   Windows NT, Whistler, and OS/2.

 * FAT32: Access is available only through Windows 95 OSR2, 
   Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Whistler.

The following list compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.

 * NTFS: Recommended minimum volume size is approximately 10 MB.
   Recommended practical maximum for volumes is 2 TB (terabytes). Much
   larger sizes are possible.
   Cannot be used on floppy disks.
   File size limited only by size of volume.

 * FAT: Volumes from floppy disk size up to 4 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 2 GB.

 * FAT32: Volumes from 512 MB to 2 TB.
   In Whistler, you can format a FAT32 volume only up to 32 GB.
   Does not support domains.
   Maximum file size is 4 GB.

Note: If you choose to format a partition as FAT during Setup and the
partition is larger than 2 GB, Setup will automatically format it
as FAT32.

9.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some of the features you can use when you choose NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory, and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in Whistler.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
choice of whether to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your 
files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format 
the partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.


======================================================================
10.0   Planning Disk Partitions for New Installations
======================================================================

You will need to plan your disk partitions before running Setup only
if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. Disk
partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a
disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by a file system such as FAT or NTFS. Different partitions
often have different drive letters (for example, C and D). A
primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you can
install the files needed to load an operating system such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
(Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.)

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Advanced Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Advanced Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. This 
allows space for a variety of items, including optional components, 
user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future service 
packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you
can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. (Note that you cannot use dynamic disks on some computers
that contain multiple operating systems. The only operating systems
that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and Whistler.)

Important: If you're setting up a computer so that it contains multiple operating systems, you must install Whistler on its own 
partition. This ensures that Whistler will not overwrite crucial files 
needed by the other operating system. For more information, see 
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating 
System" earlier in this text file series.

10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (2 GB of space is recommended, but you might need less,
depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for the
system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk. (However, you cannot use dynamic disks on
some computers that contain multiple operating systems. The only
operating systems that can access a dynamic disk are Windows 2000 and
Whistler.)

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.


======================================================================
11.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

The following list describes the components in the preceding table 
and all other components that you can install.

Accessories and Utilities
  Includes desktop accessories such as WordPad, Paint, Calculator, 
  and CD Player, as well as the Accessibility Wizard. To select 
  individual items, in the Windows Components Wizard, select 
  Accessories and Utilities, click Details, and then select the 
  subcomponents you want from the list.

Certificate Services
  Provides security and authentication support, including secure 
  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), File
  Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation 
  of phone books that can be automatically updated from a central 
  server. In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes 
  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows 
  Management Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool 
  for creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications 
  can communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers 
  that might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional  
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items in 
  the following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug
     and Play devices so that you can use them immediately, without
     additional configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     access servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target 
  clients must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot 
  eXecution Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with 
  a remote-start floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate 
  partition for Remote Installation Services. For more information, 
  see "Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" 
  earlier in this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications on
  the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal emulator
  on the client. Each user sees an individual session, displayed as a
  Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by the server,
  independent of any other client session. If you install Terminal
  Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing on at least
  one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you install 
  Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued for 
  clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be 
  issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up 
  to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content 
  using Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
12.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. (For information about using other network adapters, read the
adapter documentation, and see "Taking an Optional Device Inventory"
earlier in this text file series.) Setup and the Configure Your Server
Wizard are designed to make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the
services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

12.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
static addressing, or both. You can view information about DHCP and IP
addressing in Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called
   Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign
   IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

12.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

12.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
  the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
  are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
  e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required 
  in domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
  installed automatically when you create a domain controller 
  (or promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the 
  Whistler software detects that a DNS server already exists for that 
  domain. (Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component 
  to install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

12.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
  earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
  Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
  domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
  Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
  (For more information about different ways you can install 
  components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
  Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
  WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
  that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
  clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
13.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a single,
centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network
details. The information in this database is replicated automatically
among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain
controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You can
determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

13.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup, and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support. 

13.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

1.0   Preparing Your System for an Upgrade
======================================================================

This section describes the basic steps to prepare your
server for an upgrade.

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

Use Event Viewer to review the system log for recent or recurring
errors that could cause problems during the upgrade. For information
about viewing errors, see Whistler Help and Support Services for the 
operating system that you are running.

1.2   Reviewing Hardware and Software
======================================================================

When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process Setup carries
out is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer.
Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along 
with the information in Read1st.txt and the Application Compatibility 
section of Readme.doc (in the root directory of the Whistler CD), to 
determine whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or 
software before upgrading. If you use an Internet service provider 
(ISP), pay special attention to any recommendations about updating 
the ISP software necessary for your Internet connectivity.

1.3   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before upgrading, you should back up your current files. You can back 
up files to a disk, a tape drive, or another computer on your network.

1.4   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before upgrading to
Whistler. Do not upgrade to Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

1.5   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for Upgrade (Windows 
NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you are upgrading a computer from Windows NT 4.0 and it has a
mirror set, volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare
for the upgrade as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror.

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After the upgrade, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up
data as needed, and make use of the variety of volume options (such as
mirrored volumes) available with dynamic disks. For more information
about dynamic disks, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

1.6   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Preparing Your System for a New Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take in preparing your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Advanced Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read AdvSrv4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster Nodes."

2.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on your 
computer.

2.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server, you 
should back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or 
the current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up 
files to a variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard 
disks of other computers on the network.

2.3   Uncompressing the Drive
======================================================================

Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing
Whistler. Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the
drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. 

2.4   Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows NT 4.0 Only)
======================================================================

If you plan to perform a clean installation on a computer that
currently runs Windows NT 4.0, and it has a mirror set, volume set,
stripe set, or stripe set with parity, prepare for the installation 
as follows:

 * For a mirror set, back up the data and break the mirror. 

 * For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up
   the data and delete the set (which will delete the data).

After installation is complete, you can make the disk dynamic,
restore backed-up data as needed, and make use of the variety of
volume options (such as mirrored volumes) available with dynamic
disks. For more information about dynamic disks, see Whistler
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

2.5   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series.

How you start Setup depends on whether you are upgrading or
performing a new installation, as described in the following sections.
Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server configuration for your
specific needs. Full online help (called Help and Support Services) is
available when the Configure Your Server Wizard appears. To open
Help and Support Services, click Start, and then click Help and 
Support.

3.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

3.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Advanced Server
CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at
http://www.microsoft.com/) lists only the devices for which drivers 
are included on the Whistler Advanced Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you through supplying the driver 
file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage 
controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

3.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

3.2   Starting Setup for an Upgrade
======================================================================

If you are upgrading to Whistler, you can start Setup from the CD
or from a network. For information about the versions of Windows from
which you can upgrade, see "Upgrading" earlier in this text file
series.

For information about starting Setup for a new installation,
see "Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer"
or "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer" later in this text
file series. For information about unattended Setup and other options
available when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
later in this text file series.

>>> To start an upgrade from the CD on a computer running Windows:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start an upgrade from a network:

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared 
     drive and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3   Starting Setup for a New Installation on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD"
and "Starting a New Installation from a Network," provide procedures 
for starting Setup for a new installation. For information about 
starting Setup for an upgrade, see the previous section.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

3.3.1   Starting a New Installation from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Whistler CD for running Setup, you have several options 
for starting Setup.

Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or 
MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the setup 
process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. The usual way 
to enable disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS is 
to use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the 
documentation for WINDOWS 3.x or MS-DOS. 

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running MS-DOS:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. At the command prompt, type

   d:

   where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type

   cd i386

4. Type

   winnt

5. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 3.x:

1. Using File Manager, change to the CD-ROM drive.

2. Change to the I386 folder.

3. Double-click Winnt.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.

>>> To start Setup from the CD on a computer running Windows 95, 
Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or 
Whistler:

1. Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from
the CD. This method applies only if you want to perform a new
installation, not an upgrade. Using this method, you can perform an
installation on a computer that does not have an operating system,
although you can also use this method on computers that have operating
systems.

>>> To start Setup and perform a new installation by starting an 
x86-based computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

3.3.2   Starting a New Installation from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive, or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Find and run the appropriate file on the I386 folder of the CD
   or in the shared folder:

   * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

   * From a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
     Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler,
     run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
5.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions
automatically. Then, you run Setup from the command line; that is, you
run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for
unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system
that is running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
6.0   Entering Server Settings for a New Installation
======================================================================

If you are upgrading, you can skip this section because Setup will
use your previous settings.

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

6.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During a new installation, a dialog box gives you the opportunity to
create or specify a partition on which you want to install Whistler.
You can create a partition from the unpartitioned space available,
specify an existing partition, or delete an existing partition to
create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition. If
you specify any action that will cause information to be erased, you
will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions for New
Installations" earlier in this text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Performing a new installation of 
Whistler on a partition that contains another operating system will 
cause that operating system to be overwritten.

6.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

6.3   Personalizing Whistler Advanced Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

6.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in AdvSrv1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

6.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will be part of a domain and will use more than one operating system,
you must use a different computer name with each of the operating
systems installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT
when it is started with Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, it would
need to have a different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is
started with Whistler Advanced Server. This requirement also applies
to a computer that will start with either of two different installations of
Whistler.

6.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters, and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

6.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

6.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

6.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other protocols) 
during Setup, or you can select the Typical settings option and then 
make any necessary changes to your networking configuration after
installation, by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Advanced Server feature called Automatic Private
   IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP addresses.
   You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
   Setup and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP, 
   static addressing, or both. To open Whistler Help and Support 
   Services (which includes information about DHCP and static IP 
   addresses), after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
   Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain, by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at
   least initially, as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS:

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

6.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
7.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Advanced Server and use 
Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration
tools are also available from Administrative Tools.

3.2.2 Restrictions on the Use of Blank Passwords
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows XP has a new default security feature that helps protect users
with blank passwords from network-based attacks. Users who do not 
password-protect their accounts can only log on at their physical 
computer console: the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that is physically 
connected to their computer. This restriction only applies to local 
user accounts, not to domain user accounts.

Caution: If your computer is not in a physically secured location, you
should assign strong passwords to all local user accounts. Failure to
do so allows anyone with physical access to the computer to log on
using a user account that does not have a password. This is especially
important for portable computers, which should always have strong
passwords on all local user accounts.

3.3 Software Compatibility Issues 
======================================================================

3.3.1 Message Queuing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Products: Windows XP Home Edition only

Message Queuing is not supported on Windows XP Home Edition. If you
are upgrading from Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium
Edition computers running MSMQ version 1.0, consider upgrading your
computer to Windows XP Professional.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Advanced Server, you can use clustering to ensure that
users have constant access to important server-based resources. With
clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as
one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node
begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Mission 
critical applications and resources remain continuously available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Advanced Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer of
your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need
in order to use the hardware with Whistler Advanced Server.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several 
options. You can:

 * Upgrade the operating system on a cluster that is running
   Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For
   a description of the ways you can do this, see "Upgrading
   Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition"
   later in this text file. 

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Advanced Server and install
   Cluster service at the same time. For important information
   about preparing for cluster installation, see "Installation on
   Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, in Whistler Help and Support Services. 
To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

For information about reinstalling clustering on one of the cluster 
nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes if you 
cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

If you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition to Whistler on cluster nodes, you cannot perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information about how to perform an upgrade from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, see "Upgrading Clusters 
From Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text
file series.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

2.1 How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Advanced Server with the following
software:

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Advanced Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Advanced
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: If your goal is to have more than two nodes in the cluster, 
you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the cluster storage. Add the 
third or fourth nodes after completing the rolling upgrade. For 
cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure the 
disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as dynamic 
disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as spanned 
volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
Rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on the other node. After the groups are
   moved, one node is idle, and the other node handles all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Advanced Server Setup to upgrade the paused node from
   Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see sections
   earlier in this text file.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Advanced
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
The most basic restriction is as follows:

 * You can perform a rolling upgrade only if you are upgrading from
   Windows 2000 on the cluster nodes. You cannot perform a rolling
   upgrade if you are upgrading from Windows NT Server 4.0,
   Enterprise Edition. For a description of the ways to upgrade
   from Windows NT 4.0, see "Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT
   Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" later in this text file
   series.

The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which
you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run
different versions of the operating system. For a mixed-version
cluster to work, the different versions of the software running on
each node must be prepared to communicate with one another. This
requirement leads to several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade
process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new
resource types to prevent these resources from failing over to a
Windows 2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you
view the possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node
will not be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to
the list. If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase
of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources
will not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade on a cluster running Windows NT.
Only clusters running Windows 2000 support rolling upgrades to
Whistler.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
-------------      ---------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported  during rolling upgrades.  For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file 
                   series.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Advanced Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources 
that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Read1st.txt and Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, 
as well as the product documentation that comes with the application 
or resource.

Note: You also cannot perform a rolling upgrade when upgrading from
Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition. For more information, see 
"Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition" 
later in this text file. 

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However, with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
Cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text file, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.

======================================================================
3.0   Upgrading Clusters from Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise
Edition
======================================================================

You cannot perform a rolling upgrade directly from Windows NT Server
4.0, Enterprise Edition to Whistler. You instead have two options. You 
can maintain cluster availability by performing an upgrade to Windows 
2000 first, then to Whistler, or you can upgrade directly to Whistler. 
If you upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler, you cannot 
maintain cluster availability.

3.1   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 while Maintaining Cluster 
Availability
======================================================================

To maintain cluster availability when upgrading from Windows NT 4.0
to Whistler, you must first upgrade to Windows 2000.

>>> To perform an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 while maintaining 
cluster availability:

1. Perform a rolling upgrade on one node from Windows NT 4.0 to 
   Windows 2000 as documented in "To Perform a Rolling Upgrade" in the
   Windows 2000 documentation. However, do not repeat the process
   for the other nodes as documented in those instructions. 

Important: For step 1, be sure to follow the procedures in the Windows 
2000 documentation, not the Whistler procedures, as the procedures are 
different for each version.  

2. Perform an upgrade on all other nodes from Windows NT 4.0 to
   Whistler. For more information, see "Performing a Rolling
   Upgrade" earlier in this text file. Follow the instructions, 
   upgrading only Node 2, not Node 1. For general information about 
   Setup, review the sections earlier in this text file series.

3. Perform an upgrade on the Windows 2000 node from Windows 2000 to
   Whistler. 

3.2   Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 While Not Maintaining Cluster
Availability
======================================================================

To upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler without the intermediate 
step of upgrading to Windows 2000, you must interrupt cluster 
availability. The steps you perform to upgrade while not maintaining 
cluster availability depend on the hardware you are using for your 
cluster: either a Fibre Channel bus or a SCSI bus.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler when using a 
Fibre Channel bus:

1. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

2. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

3. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

4. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

5. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

6. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make
   configuration changes such as configuring cluster disks as
   dynamic disks. For more information about the limitations of server 
   clusters, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

7. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

8. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
   Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

9. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
   system on that node.

   The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

>>> To upgrade directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Whistler When Using a 
SCSI Bus:

1. Review the appropriate instructions for making sure that the SCSI
   bus is terminated or for putting Y-cables or TriLink cables in
   place. These instructions are in Cluster Administrator Help in
   Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, in the Index under
   "nodes, disconnecting." If you have used an alternative set of
   instructions from the Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
   CD, in \Support\Books\Mscsadm5.doc, review these instructions. You 
   will carry out the instructions in a later step.

2. As appropriate, notify users that you will be shutting down the
   applications they use on the cluster.

3. Stop the applications that are made available through the cluster.

4. To stop Cluster service on all nodes but one, in Cluster
   Administrator, click each node you want to stop, and then on the
   File menu, click Stop Cluster Service.

5. On Node 1, follow the appropriate instructions to make sure the
   SCSI bus is terminated, or that Y-cables or TriLink cables are
   in place. 

6. Shut down and turn off all nodes but one, or bring them to a 
   shut-down state appropriate to your method of termination.

Caution: Be sure that only one node is running before continuing. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

7. Upgrade the operating system on the node that is running. For
   general information about Setup, review the sections earlier in
   this text file series.

8. The cluster software will be upgraded automatically during the
   operating system upgrade. Note that you cannot make configuration 
   changes such as configuring cluster disks as dynamic disks. For 
   more information about the limitations of server clusters, see 
   Whistler Help and Support Services.

9. On the node that is running, click Start, point to Programs, point
   to Administrative Tools, and then click Cluster Administrator.

10. Check to see that the cluster disks are online in Cluster
    Administrator.

Caution: Be sure that that the cluster disks are online in Cluster 
Administrator before continuing to the next step. When the disks are 
online, it means that Cluster service is working, which means that 
only one node can access the cluster storage at any given time. This 
prevents corruption of the cluster storage.

11. Turn on the other node in the cluster and upgrade the operating
    system on that node.

    The node automatically rejoins the existing cluster.

Important: If your cluster storage uses SCSI, you can have two nodes 
in the cluster, but no more. If you want to have more than two nodes 
in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel for the cluster storage.

======================================================================
4.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

4.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously.  
Each node of your cluster must be running Advanced Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

 * Cluster hardware and drivers.

   Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and other
   cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Advanced Server. To
   check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on the 
   Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
   up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
   Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 
   
   http://www.microsoft.com/
   
   You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fibre
   Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk
   adapter.
   
   Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
   cluster storage hardware with Whistler Advanced Server. (Drivers 
   are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

   Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
   installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
   be corrupted. If your cluster hardware includes a SCSI bus, be sure 
   to review carefully any instructions about termination of the SCSI 
   bus and configuration of SCSI IDs.
   
   To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
   problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.
   
 * Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

   In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
   adapter will carry.
   
   Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
   plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
   and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
   adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
   subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   -----------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

   Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
   purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
   whenever you are configuring the server.

 * Cluster IP address.

   Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
   DHCP for this address.

 * IP addressing for cluster nodes.

   Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
   Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You 
   can provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each 
   network adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP 
   addresses, the addresses for each linked pair of network adapters 
   (linked node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

   Note: if you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
   single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
   so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
   temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
   unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
   DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
   consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster 
   nodes. This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP 
   address.

 * Cluster name.

   Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This 
   is the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
   (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
   different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
   the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
   other cluster names on the domain.

 * Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

   Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in 
   the same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

 * Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
   service.

   To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
   each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
   those nodes.

 * Cluster service user account.

   Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the 
   name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
   will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
   installation.

   The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
   account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
   account also must have local administrative privileges on all of 
   the cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on 
   the account (follow your organization's policies for password 
   renewal).

 * Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
   and log files).

   You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
   for holding important cluster configuration information. This
   information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
   when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
   node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user data.

 * List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
   which you will install clustering.
   
   Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
   relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
   make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
   This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
   during cluster configuration.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
   formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
   not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned 
   volumes (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

4.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

4.2.1   Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the following steps while the cluster nodes are still
displaying BIOS or EFI configuration screens before starting the
operating system on the first cluster node.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure you understand and follow the
   manufacturer's instructions for termination of the SCSI bus.

 * If you have a SCSI bus, make sure that each device on the shared
   bus (both SCSI controllers and hard disks) has a unique SCSI ID.
   If the SCSI controllers all default to the same ID (often it is
   SCSI ID 7), change one controller to a different SCSI ID such
   as SCSI ID 6. If there is more than one disk that will be on the
   shared SCSI bus, each disk must also have a unique SCSI ID. In
   addition, make sure that the bus is not configured to reset SCSI
   IDs automatically during startup (otherwise the IDs will change 
   from the settings you specify).

 * Ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from both
   cluster nodes (while remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration
   screens).

4.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

4.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Advanced Server and Cluster service 
Are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

4.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Advanced Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Advanced Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Advanced Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then
   click Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

After making the decisions outlined in this text file series, you'll
be ready to run Whistler Setup and, later, to use Configure Your
Server. Together, Setup and Configure Your Server help you get
your servers up and running quickly. To find out more about Configure
Your Server, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help
and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then 
click Help and Support.

======================================================================
1.0   System Requirements and Hardware Compatibility
======================================================================

Computers that run Whistler Datacenter Server must be on the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL). The HCL is on the Whistler CD, in the
Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most up-to-date list of supported 
hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List by visiting the 
Microsoft Web site at:

http://www.microsoft.com/

The requirements for systems on the Datacenter Server HCL include the
following:

 * 400 megahertz (MHz) Pentium or higher central processing unit 
   (CPU) for x86-based computers, and 800 MHz Pentium or higher for
   Itanium-based computers.

   * On x86-based computers, a maximum of 32 CPUs per computer 
     are supported.

   * On Itanium-based computers, a maximum of 64 CPUs per computer
     are supported.

 * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum.

   * On x86-based computers, maximum RAM is 64 GB.

   * On Itanium-based computers, maximum RAM is 128 GB.

 * A hard disk partition with enough free space to accommodate the
   setup process. The minimum amount of space required is
   approximately 2 GB. More space might be needed, depending on the
   following:

   * The components being installed: the more components, the more
     space needed.

   * The file system used: FAT requires 100-200 MB more free disk
     space than other file systems. (NTFS is the recommended file
     system.)

   * The method used for installation: if installing across a
     network, allow 100-200 MB more space than if installing from
     the CD. (More driver files need to be available during
     installation across a network.)

   * The size of the paging file.

Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described in the 
previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space 
used for the operating system (excluding user accounts) is usually 
less than the free space required for Setup, depending on the system 
components installed.

For additional information about planning the sizes of disk 
partitions, including information about creating a separate partition
for Remote Installation Services, see "Planning Disk Partitions" later
in this text file series.

 * VGA or higher-resolution monitor, keyboard, and (optionally) a
   mouse or other pointing device.

   Alternatively, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you
   can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor from the
   list in the HCL.

For CD installation:

 * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

 * One or more Whistler-compatible network adapters and related
   cables.

 * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

======================================================================
2.0   Important Files to Review
======================================================================

At some point in your planning process, before running Setup, 
familiarize yourself with the Readme.doc file found on the root 
directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. This file contains 
important usage information about hardware, networks, applications, 
and printing.

You should also review the Hardware Compatibility List for
Whistler Datacenter Server. For more information, see "System 
Requirements and Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file 
series.

======================================================================
3.0   Decisions Made During Installation
======================================================================

The following list outlines the basic choices available during
installation.

3.1   What Licensing Mode to Use
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server. The Per Seat mode requires a separate Client
Access License (CAL) for each computer that accesses a server running
Whistler. The Per Server mode requires a separate CAL for each 
Concurrent connection to a server.

If you plan to use Terminal Server, you will probably choose Per Seat
licensing, and you will also need to install two components, Terminal
Server and Terminal Server Licensing. For more information about
licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file
series. For more information about Terminal Server components,
see "Choosing Components to Install" later in this text file series.

3.2   What File System to Use
======================================================================

The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the 
only file system recommended for Datacenter Server. It is also the 
only file system that supports Active Directory, which includes many
important features such as domains and domain-based security.

3.3   What Partition You Will Install On, or Whether You Will Need a New Partition for Your Installation
======================================================================

Before running Setup, you will need to review your disk partitions. A
partition divides a disk into one or more areas that can be formatted
for use by one file system. Different partitions often have different
drive letters (for example, C and D). After running Setup, you can
modify the partitioning of the disk. For information about planning
the partitions for a new installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions"
later in this text file series.

3.4   What Components to Install
======================================================================

There are a variety of optional components to choose from when
installing Whistler Datacenter Server. You can install these
components during Setup, or you can add them later (through Add or
Remove Programs in Control Panel). Alternatively, you can use the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will choose and install components
for you according to the type of server you specify. For more
information about components, see "Choosing Components to Install"
later in this text file series.

3.5   How to Handle Networks, IP Addresses, and TCP/IP Name Resolution
======================================================================

Most networked computers currently use TCP/IP as the network
protocol. If you use a different network protocol, before running
Setup you will need to familiarize yourself with your current
settings. With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you will
need to make decisions about how to handle IP addresses and how they
will be resolved (translated) into names that users recognize. For
more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name
Resolution" later in this text file series.

3.6   Whether to Create Domains or Workgroups for Your Servers
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is more basic,
intended only to help users find such things as printers and shared
folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator
to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more
information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains" later in
this text file series.

======================================================================
4.0   Choosing a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Products in the Whistler Server family support two licensing modes:
Per Seat and Per Server.

If you choose the Per Seat mode, each computer that accesses a server
running Whistler requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With
one CAL, a particular client computer can connect to any number of
servers. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies
with more than one server running a product from the Whistler Server
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you selected the Per Server client licensing mode and
five concurrent connections, this server could have five computers
(clients) connected at any one time. Those computers would not need
any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server running Whistler Datacenter Server. It is also
useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client
computers might not be licensed as Whistler network clients. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can
change once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost. (However, if you
plan to use Terminal Server, see the next paragraph.)

If you plan to use Terminal Server, the licensing mode is usually Per
Seat, except with the Terminal Server Internet Connector license,
where the mode is always Per Server. In addition, you also need to 
install two components: Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing. 
For more information about these components, see "Choosing Components 
to Install" later in this text file series.

======================================================================
5.0 Choosing a File System
======================================================================

You can choose among three file systems for disk partitions on a
computer running Whistler: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the
recommended system. FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except
that FAT32 is designed for larger disks than FAT. (The file system
that works most easily with large disks is NTFS.) This section
provides information to help you compare the file systems. The section
that follows provides additional information about NTFS.

NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000 and Whistler include a new version of NTFS, with support
for a variety of features including Active Directory, which is needed
for domains, user accounts, and other important security features. For
more details about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text
file series.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). If you don't 
need to keep your files intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, 
you should format the partition with NTFS rather than converting from 
FAT or FAT32. Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, 
but a partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from 
FAT or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after completing Setup by using Convert.exe. For 
more information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click 
Start, click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command 
window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and 
domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

5.1   NTFS
======================================================================

Some the features included in NTFS are:

 * Active Directory, which you can use to view and control network
   resources easily.

 * Domains, which are part of Active Directory and which you can use
   to fine-tune security options while keeping administration
   simple. Domain controllers require NTFS.

 * File encryption, which greatly enhances security.

 * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
   folders.

 * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
   in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
   NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
   are written to.

 * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
   making removable media such as tapes more accessible.

 * Recovery logging of disk activities, which helps you restore
   information quickly in the event of power failure or other
   system problems.

 * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
   of disk space used by individual users.

 * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum drive size for
   NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as drive size
   increases, performance with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with
   FAT.

Setup makes it easy to convert your partition to the new version of 
NTFS, even if it used FAT or FAT32 before. This kind of conversion 
keeps your files intact (unlike formatting a partition). Setup begins 
by checking the existing file system. If it is NTFS, conversion 
happens automatically. If it is FAT or FAT32, Setup gives you the 
opportunity to convert to NTFS. If you don't need to keep your files 
intact and you have a FAT or FAT32 partition, you should format the 
partition with NTFS rather than converting from FAT or FAT32. 
Formatting a partition erases all data on the partition, but a 
partition that is formatted with NTFS rather than converted from FAT 
or FAT32 will have less fragmentation and better performance.

However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS, regardless of whether
the partition was formatted with NTFS or converted. A partition can
also be converted after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click Start,
click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. In the command window, type
help convert, and then press ENTER.

======================================================================
6.0   Planning Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be
formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). A primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you 
can install the files needed to load an operating system, such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Datacenter Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Datacenter Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. 
This allows space for a variety of items, including optional
components, user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future
service packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other
items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server,
you can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. 

6.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (you should allow 2 GB of space, but you might need 
less, depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for 
the system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk.

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

6.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup. After Setup, 
you can modify the partitioning of the disk by using Disk Management.

During the installation process, Setup examines the hard disk to
determine its existing configuration and then offers the following
options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.

6.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Whistler Partitions
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of Whistler (including Whistler
Professional and any product in the Whistler Server family). If you
want to set up a computer this way, note the following:

 * It is not necessary to create multiple installations of 
   Whistler for insurance against startup difficulties resulting 
   from driver or disk problems. Whistler includes a variety of 
   disaster-recovery features, one of which is safe mode. When 
   started in safe mode, Whistler uses default settings and the 
   minimum number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even 
   if a new driver is causing a problem). Another recovery feature 
   is the Recovery Console, a command-line interface that you can 
   start from the Setup CD. After starting the Recovery Console 
   and logging on, you can perform tasks such as starting and stopping 
   services and accessing the local drive. For more information about
   disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you use Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
   containing multiple installations of Whistler, the encrypted
   files will not be readable between the different installations
   unless you take one of the following approaches. One approach is
   to ensure that all the installations are in the same domain and
   that the user of these installations has a roaming profile.
   Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation of 
  phone books that can be automatically updated from a central server. 
  In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes Simple 
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management 
  Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool for
  creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications can
  communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers that
  might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional 
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items 
  in the  following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug and Play devices 
     so that you can use them immediately, without additional 
     configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     gain access to servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target clients
  must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot eXecution
  Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with a remote-start
  floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate partition for
  Remote Installation Services. For more information, see "Disk
  Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" earlier in
  this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications 
  on the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal 
  emulator on the client. Each user sees an individual session, 
  displayed as a Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by 
  the server, independent of any other client session. If you 
  install Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server 
  Licensing on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer 
  on which you install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses 
  can be issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server 
  for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued 
  for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content using
  Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
8.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard are designed to 
make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows 
Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

8.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP,
static addressing, or both. For more information about DHCP and IP
addressing, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature
   called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically
   assign IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

8.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers 
on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required in 
domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
installed automatically when you create a domain controller (or 
promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the Whistler 
software detects that a DNS server already exists for that domain. 
(Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component to 
install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

8.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
---------------------------------------------

If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
(For more information about different ways you can install 
components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a 
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other 
network details. The information in this database is replicated 
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers 
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You 
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller, to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.2   Additional Information About Domains
======================================================================

For detailed information about domains, operations master roles, and
other domain-related topics, see Active Directory in Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after 
you install Whistler on your first server, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

For information about setting up multiple domains with structured 
relationships, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

With Whistler Datacenter Server, you can use clustering to ensure
that users have constant access to important server-based resources.
With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to 
users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another 
node begins to provide service (a process known as failover). 
Mission critical applications and resources remain continuously 
available.

======================================================================
1.0   Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

Before installing or upgrading clustering, you should familiarize 
yourself with the basic preparations needed and the options available 
for upgrading and installing. The following sections provide 
information on these topics.

1.1   Preparing for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

To prepare for installing or upgrading clustering, review the
sections earlier in this text file series. As described in those
sections, check the Hardware Compatibility List to ensure that all
your hardware (including your cluster storage) is compatible with
Whistler Datacenter Server. In addition, check with the manufacturer
of your cluster storage hardware to be sure you have the drivers you
need in order to use the hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server.

1.2   Options for Upgrading or Installing Clustering
======================================================================

When installing or upgrading clustering, you can choose among several options. You can:

 * Upgrade a cluster that is running Windows 2000, possibly
   through a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "How
   Rolling Upgrades Work" and "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * Perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server and
   install Cluster service at the same time. For important
   information about preparing for cluster installation,
   see "Installation on Cluster Nodes" later in this text file.

Note: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets). For more information about the 
limitations of server clusters, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help.

For more information about reinstalling clustering on one of the 
cluster nodes, see Whistler Help and Support Services.


======================================================================
2.0   Upgrading a Cluster from Windows 2000 to Whistler
======================================================================

If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Whistler on cluster nodes,
you might be able to perform a rolling upgrade of the operating
system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating
system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to
handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the
Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade
maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes
administrative complexity. For more information, see the following 
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade and understand 
the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered 
resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this text 
file series. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes 
if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling 
Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this text file series.

2.1   How Rolling Upgrades Work
======================================================================

This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For
information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling
upgrades, see the following sections.

There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is
a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server
response time might decrease during the phases in which one node 
handles the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to 
recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact 
during the upgrade process.

A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running
Windows 2000. In this example, they are named Node 1 and Node 2.

Phase 1: Preliminary
Each node runs Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with the following
hardware and software:

 * A cluster storage unit using Fibre Channel, not SCSI. Fibre
   Channel is the only type of cluster storage on the Hardware
   Compatibility List for Datacenter Server. (Note that SCSI can be
   used for a two-node cluster with Advanced Server, not Datacenter
   Server.) 

 * The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of
   Windows 2000 Datacenter Server).

 * Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information,
   see the product documentation and "Resource Behavior During
   Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file.

At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles
client requests (an active/active configuration).

Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1
Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while
you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Whistler Datacenter
Server.

Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2 
Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all
cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on 
Node 2.

Phase 4: Final 
Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups
back to the active/active cluster configuration.

Important: For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and 
configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks 
as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as 
spanned volumes (volume sets).

2.1.1   Performing a Rolling Upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding
section, "How Rolling Upgrades Work."

Important: For information about what resources are supported during 
rolling upgrades, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" and "Resource 
Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this text file series.

>>> To perform a rolling upgrade: 

1. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that you want to upgrade
   first.

2. On the File menu, click Pause Node.

3. In the right pane, double-click Active Groups.

4. In the right pane, click a group, and then on the File menu, click
   Move Group. Repeat this step for each group listed.

   The services will be interrupted during the time they are being
   moved and restarted on another node. After the groups are moved,
   one node is idle, and the other nodes handle all client
   requests.

5. Use Whistler Datacenter Server Setup to upgrade the paused node
   from Windows 2000. For information about running Setup, see
   sections earlier in this text file series.

   Setup detects the earlier version of clustering on the paused node
   and automatically installs clustering for Whistler Datacenter
   Server. The node automatically rejoins the cluster at the end of
   the upgrade process, but is still paused and does not handle any
   cluster-related work.

6. To verify that the node that was upgraded is fully functional,
   perform validation tests on it.

7. In Cluster Administrator, click the node that was paused, and then
   on the file menu, click Resume Node.

8. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining node or nodes.

2.2   Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process.
They involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run different versions
of the operating system. For a mixed-version cluster to work, the
different versions of the software running on each node must be
prepared to communicate with one another. This requirement leads to
several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade process.

 * For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster
   manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more
   information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades"
   later in this text file.

 * During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the
   cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating
   system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do
   not change the settings of a printer resource).

If preceding restrictions cannot be met, do not perform a rolling
upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades
from Windows 2000" later in this text file.

2.2.1   Operation of New Resource Types in Mixed-Version Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one 
version of the operating system but not in the other, the operation of 
a mixed-version cluster is complicated. For example, Cluster service
in Whistler (part of the Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
products) supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older
versions of Cluster service do not support it. A mixed-version
cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Whistler
but not on a node running Windows 2000.

Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new resource 
types to prevent these resources from failing over to a Windows 2000 
node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you view the 
possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows 2000 node will not 
be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to the list. 
If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase of a 
rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources will 
not fail over to a Windows 2000 node.

2.3   Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades
======================================================================

Although Cluster service supports rolling upgrades, not all
applications have seamless rolling-upgrade behavior. The following
table describes which resources will be supported during a rolling
upgrade. If you have a resource that is not fully supported during
rolling upgrades, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from 
Windows 2000" later in this text file.

RESOURCE           ROLLING UPGRADE NOTES
--------------     ------------------------------------------------
DHCP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
File Share         Supported during rolling upgrades.
IP Address         Supported during rolling upgrades.
Network Name       Supported during rolling upgrades.
NNTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Physical Disk      Supported during rolling upgrades
Time Service       Supported during rolling upgrades.
SMTP               Supported during rolling upgrades.
WINS               Supported during rolling upgrades.
Print Spooler      The only Print Spooler resources supported
                   during a rolling upgrade are those on LPR ports
                   or standard monitor ports. See the following
                   section, "Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler
                   Resource."
IIS                Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 is not
                   supported during rolling upgrades. For more
                   information, see "Upgrades the include an IIS
                   resource" later in this text file.
MS DTC             Microsoft Distributed Transaction
                   Coordinator is not supported during a rolling
                   upgrade. However, you can perform a process
                   similar to rolling upgrades. See "Upgrades that
                   Include an MS DTC Resource" later in this text file.
MSMQ               Microsoft Message Queuing is not supported
                   during a rolling upgrade. To upgrade a cluster
                   which includes MSMQ, see "Upgrades that Include
                   an MSMQ Resource" later in this text file.
Other resource     See Readme.doc in the root
types              directory of the Whistler Datacenter Server CD.
                   Also see the product documentation that comes
                   with the application or resource.

2.3.1   Upgrades that Include a Print Spooler Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a
Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.

First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including
rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) on printers on 
cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Monitor ports). For 
information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see 
"Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000" later in this 
text file series.

Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print
Spooler resource, note the following:

 * Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a
   Print Spooler resource.

 * If you add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that
   printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows 2000 and
   the driver for Whistler on all nodes. 

 * If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to
   check them. Printing preferences in Whistler won't necessarily
   correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows
   2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the
   two operating systems.

When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are
running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications
you choose to your printer configuration.

2.4   Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows 2000
======================================================================

Certain resources are not supported during rolling upgrades,
including: 

   * Internet Information Server (IIS)

   * Microsoft Data Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)

   * Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)

Special procedures, described below, must be followed when performing
an upgrade of a cluster that contains these resources. In addition to
the three resource types above, you might also have other resources that are not supported during rolling upgrades. Be sure to read 
Readme.doc in the root directory of the Whistler CD, as well as the 
product documentation that comes with the application or resource.

2.4.1   Upgrades that Include an IIS Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. With earlier
versions of IIS, you could configure an individual Web site to fail
over as a cluster resource. However with IIS 6.0, the entire IIS
service must fail over, not individual Web sites. If you have
individual Web sites or the IIS service configured as a cluster
resource, you must use the following procedure to upgrade to Whistler.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an IIS 
resource:

1. Remove any individual Web sites that you have configured as
   cluster resources from their cluster group. You can no longer
   designate a single site as a cluster resource.  

2. If you have the IIS service configured as a cluster resource, take
   this resource offline. To take the resource offline, follow the
   procedures described in "Upgrades for Other Non-Supported
   Resources" later in this text file.

3. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file. 

4. Once you have completed the upgrade, you can bring the IIS service
   back online.

Important: With IIS 6.0, you can only configure the IIS service as a 
cluster resource. You cannot configure individual Web sites as cluster 
resources.

2.4.2   Upgrades that Include an MS DTC Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is not 
Supported during rolling upgrades. However, you can perform a process 
similar to a rolling upgrade.

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MS DTC 
resource:

1. Take the MS DTC resource offline by using the Cluster Administrator 
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click the 
   MS DTC resource, then on the File menu, click Take Offline. 

   Caution: Taking a resource offline causes all resources that depend 
   on that resource to be taken offline.

2. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the node it is currently on by using the Cluster
   Administrator and clicking the Resource folder. In the details
   pane, click the MS DTC resource. On the File menu, click
   Properties. On the General tab, next to Possible owners, click
   Modify. Specify Node 2 as an Available node, and if necessary,
   remove Node 1 from the Available nodes list.

3. Upgrade a node that does not contain the MS DTC resource from 
   Windows 2000 to Whistler. For general information about Setup, 
   review the sections earlier in this text file series.

4. Move the MS DTC resource to the upgraded nodes, following the
   procedures as described in step 1.

5. Configure the MS DTC resource so that the only allowable owner
   is the upgraded node, following the procedures as described in
   step 2.

6. Upgrade the remaining nodes from Windows 2000 to Whistler.  

7. Configure the allowable owners for the MS DTC resource as 
   appropriate for your configuration.

8. Manually restart all dependent services, and then bring the MS DTC
   resource back online by using the Cluster Administrator
   and clicking the Resources folder. In the details pane, click
   the MS DTC resource, and then on the File menu, click Bring Online.

2.4.3   Upgrades That Include an MSMQ Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) does not support rolling upgrades. 
The MSMQ resource is dependent on the MS DTC resource, so be sure to
follow the steps outlined in the preceding section "Upgrades that
Include an MS DTC Resource." 

>>> To upgrade from Windows 2000 on a cluster that includes an MSMQ 
resource:

1. Upgrade the operating system of the nodes to Whistler.  

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Configure Your Server.

3. In Configure Your Server, click Finish Setup, and then click
   Configure Message Queuing Cluster Resources.

4. Follow the instructions that appear in the Configure Message
   Queuing Cluster Resources Wizard.

2.4.4   Upgrades for Other Non-Supported Resources 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other resources on your cluster that are not supported
during a rolling upgrade, but are not described above, take those
resources offline prior to performing the rolling upgrade. 

>>> To take a resource offline and perform a rolling upgrade:

1. Confirm that your systems are running Windows 2000.

2. Using the information in "Resource Behavior During Rolling
   Upgrades" earlier in this text files, list the resources
   in your cluster that are not supported during rolling upgrades.

3. In Cluster Administrator, click the Resources folder.

4. In the right pane, click the resource you want.

5. On the File menu, click Take Offline.

6. Repeat the preceding steps until you have taken offline all
   resources that do not support rolling upgrades.

7. Perform a rolling upgrade, as described in the procedure "To 
   perform a rolling upgrade" earlier in this text file series.

8. For each resource that you listed in step 2, follow the
   product's instructions for installing or reconfiguring the
   application so that it will run with Whistler.


======================================================================
3.0   Installation on Cluster Nodes
======================================================================

The following sections provide important information about how to
prepare for cluster installation, begin hardware installation for a
cluster, and start Setup on the first cluster node.

3.1   Planning and Preparing for Cluster Installation
======================================================================

Before carrying out cluster installation, you will need to plan 
hardware and network details.

Caution: Make sure that Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on one node before starting the operating system 
on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple nodes 
before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster storage 
could be corrupted. Once Cluster service is  running properly on one 
node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously. 
Each node of your cluster must be running Datacenter Server. 

In your planning, review the following items:

* Cluster hardware and drivers.

  Check that your hardware, including your cluster storage and 
  other cluster hardware, is compatible with Whistler Datacenter 
  Server. To check this, see the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) on 
  The Whistler CD, in the Support folder, in Hcl.txt. For the most 
  up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware 
  Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at: 

  http://www.microsoft.com/

  You must have a separate PCI storage host adapter (SCSI or Fiber
  Channel) for the shared disks. This is in addition to the bootdisk 
  adapter.

  Also check that you have the drivers you need in order to use the
  cluster storage hardware with Whistler Datacenter Server. (Drivers 
  are available from your hardware manufacturer.)

  Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
  installing cluster hardware. Otherwise, the cluster storage could 
  be corrupted. 

  To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
  problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

* Network adapters on the cluster nodes.

  In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
  adapter will carry.

  Note: To reduce the risks with having a single point of failure, 
  plan on having two or more network adapters in each cluster node, 
  and connecting each adapter to a physically separate network. The 
  adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different 
  subnet masks.

The following table shows recommended ways of connecting network
adapters:

ADAPTERS   
PER NODE   RECOMMENDED USE
--------   --------------------------------------------------------
2          One private network (node-to-node only), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).
3          Two private networks (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster).
           With this configuration, the adapters using the private
           network must use static IP addresses (not DHCP).
           or
           One private network (node-to-node), plus
           one public network (client-to-cluster), plus
           one mixed network (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster).

The following list provides more details about the types of
communication that an adapter can carry:

 * Only node-to-node communication (private network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

   For node-to-node communication, you will connect the network
   adapter to a private network used exclusively within the
   cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or
   network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential
   point of failure in your cluster.

   The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet, but you can use
   virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
   nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
   must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
   appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective 
   of the operating system. To avoid single points of failure, use 
   independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the 
   nodes.

   If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, the
   adapters for those networks must use static IP addresses (not
   DHCP).

 * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network).

   This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to 
   carry other communication.

 * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
   network).

   If you have only one network adapter per node, it must
   carry both these kinds of communication. If you have multiple
   network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both
   kinds of communication can provide backup for other network
   adapters.

 * Communication unrelated to the cluster.

   If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the 
   cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you 
   might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated 
   to the cluster.

Consider choosing a name for each connection that describes its 
purpose. The name will make it easier to identify the connection 
whenever you are configuring the server.

* Cluster IP address.

  Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
  DHCP for this address.

* IP addressing for cluster nodes.

  Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the cluster nodes. 
  Each network adapter on each node will need IP addressing. You can 
  provide IP addressing through DHCP, or you can assign each network 
  adapter a static IP address. If you use static IP addresses, the 
  addresses for each linked pair of network adapters (linked 
  node-to-node) should be on the same subnet.

  Note: If you use DHCP for the cluster nodes, it can act as a
  single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes 
  so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, 
  temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary 
  unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use 
  DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and 
  consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster nodes. 
  This will help ensure that they always have a valid IP address.

* Cluster name.

  Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is 
  the name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. 
  (The actual applications running on the cluster will typically have
  different network names.) The cluster name must be different from 
  the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from 
  other cluster names on the domain.

* Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes.

  Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
  same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

* Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
  service.

  To install and configure Cluster service, you must log on to 
  each node with an account that has administrative privileges on 
  those nodes.

* Cluster service user account.

  Create or obtain Cluster service user account. This is the 
  name and password under which Cluster service will run. You 
  will need to supply this user name and password during cluster 
  installation.

  The Cluster service user account should be a new account. The
  account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. The
  account also must have local administrative privileges on all of the
  cluster nodes. Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the
  account (follow your organization's policies for password renewal).

* Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint 
  and log files).

  You need to plan to set aside a volume on your cluster storage
  for holding important cluster configuration information. This
  information makes up the quorum resource of the cluster, needed 
  when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides 
  node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster.

  The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. You should 
  use a different volume for the quorum resource than you use for user 
  data.

* List of storage devices or disks attached to the first server on 
  which you will install clustering.

  Unless the first server on which you will install clustering has 
  relatively few storage devices or disks attached to it, you should 
  make a list that identifies the ones intended for cluster storage. 
  This makes it easy to choose storage devices or disks correctly 
  during cluster configuration.

  Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the 
  cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions 
  formatted as NTFS. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do 
  not use Encrypting File System, volume mount points, spanned volumes 
  (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks.

The following section describes the physical installation of the
cluster storage.

3.2   Beginning the Installation of the Cluster Hardware
======================================================================

The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

Important: Carefully review your network cables after connecting them. 
Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example, private 
network connected to public).

Caution: When you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus 
and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware 
configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a 
cluster). On a 32-bit computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On 
a 64-bit computer, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 
configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will 
describe whether these configuration screens are displayed 
automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, 
press specific keys to open them. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. 
Remain in the BIOS or EFI, and do not allow the operating system to 
start during this initial installation phase.

3.3   Completing the Installation
======================================================================

After the BIOS or EFI configuration is completed, start the operating
system on one cluster node only and carry out the installation of 
Cluster service. Before starting the operating system on another node, 
make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service are 
installed and running on that node. If the operating system is started 
on multiple nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the 
cluster storage could be corrupted.

While remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that
you can scan the bus and see the drives from all cluster nodes.

3.4   Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================

It is important that you work on one node (never two nodes) when you
exit the BIOS or EFI configuration screens and allow the operating
system to start for the first time.

Caution: Make sure that Whistler Datacenter Server and Cluster service 
are installed and running on one node before starting the operating 
system on another node. If the operating system is started on multiple 
nodes before Cluster service is running on one node, the cluster 
storage could be corrupted.

3.4.1   Completing the Installation on the First Cluster Node
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already installed Whistler Datacenter Server on the
first cluster node, install it now. For information about decisions
you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the
components to install, see the sections earlier in this text file
series.

When Whistler Datacenter Server is installed, use the following
procedure to obtain specific information about how to complete the
installation of the cluster.

>>> To obtain additional information about how to install and 
configure Cluster service:

1. With Whistler Datacenter Server running on one cluster node, click
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

2. Click Enterprise Technologies, and then click Windows Clustering.

3. Click Server Clusters.

4. Click Checklists: Creating Server Clusters, and then click 
Checklist: Creating a server cluster.

5. Use the checklist to guide you through the process of completing
   the installation of your server cluster.

These notes support a preliminary release of a software program that
bears the project code name Whistler.

This part of the text file series explains how to set up Whistler
Datacenter Server. For background information that will help you make
appropriate choices during Setup, see the earlier sections of the text
file series.

In this section of the text file series:
1.0     Preparing Your System for Installation
2.0     Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
3.0     Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
4.0     Planning for Unattended Setup
5.0     Entering Server Settings During Installation
6.0     Configuring Your Server


======================================================================
1.0   Preparing Your System for Installation
======================================================================

This topic describes the basic steps to take to prepare your server
for a new installation. 

If you are installing Datacenter Server on server cluster nodes, be
sure to read Datactr4.txt, "Upgrading and Installing on Cluster 
Nodes."

1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
======================================================================

If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Whistler Help and Support Services for 
the operating system on your computer.

1.2   Backing Up Files
======================================================================

Before you install Whistler Datacenter Server, you should back up your 
current files, unless the computer has no files or the current 
operating system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a 
variety of different media, such as tape drives or the hard disks of 
other computers on the network.

1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
======================================================================

If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Whistler Setup attempts to automatically detect devices
connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with
the detection process.


======================================================================
2.0   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an x86-based computer.
For an explanation of how to start Setup on an Itanium-based computer,
see "Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer," later in this text
file series.

After you start Setup, it works in several stages, prompting you for
information, copying files, and restarting. Setup concludes with the
Configure Your Server Wizard, which you can use to adjust the server
configuration for your specific needs. Full online help (called Help
and Support Services) is available when the Configure Your Server
Wizard appears. To open Help and Support Services, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.

2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
======================================================================

If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, you will need to
provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1   Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see if the controller is on the
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) that was released with the software,
that is, Hcl.txt in the Support folder on the Whistler Datacenter
Server CD. This file (as contrasted with the updated HCL at 
http://www.microsoft.com) lists only the devices for which drivers are 
included on the Whistler Datacenter Server CD. If your controller is 
not listed in the HCL on the CD, but the manufacturer has supplied a 
separate driver file for use with Whistler, locate the CD or other 
medium containing the file before beginning Setup. During the early 
part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to 
press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file 
to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure if your mass storage controller is supported, you
can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported, an error
message will indicate a problem with an inaccessible boot device.

2.1.2   Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before beginning Setup, locate the 
CD or other medium containing the file. During the early part of
Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6.
At this time, do not press F6. Press F5 instead. After you press F5, 
follow the instructions that appear. In this way, you can include your 
HAL file in the Setup process.

2.2   Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer
======================================================================

You can start Setup from a CD or from a network.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when starting Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this
text file series.

2.2.1   Starting from a CD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Microsoft Whistler CD for running Setup, you have
several options for starting Setup.

>>> To start setup from the CD:

1. Insert the CD in the drive, and wait for Setup to start.

2. Follow the instructions that appear.

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from the 
CD-ROM drive. Using this method, you can perform a new installation on 
A computer that does not have an operating system, although you can 
Also use this method on computers that have operating systems.

>>> To start Setup for a new installation by starting an x86-based 
computer from the CD:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive.

2. Start the computer and wait for Setup to start.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.

2.2.2   Starting Setup from a Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Whistler from a network, you share the files either
directly from the CD or copy them to a shared folder. Then, you
start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>> To install Whistler from a network (x86-based computers only):

1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
   inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying
   the files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

2. On the computer on which you want to install Whistler, connect to
   the shared Setup files:

   * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared drive
     and change to the I386 folder.

   * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

3. Run Winnt32.exe.

4. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
3.0   Starting Setup on an Itanium-based Computer
======================================================================

This section explains how to start Setup on an Itanium-based
computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based
computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in
this text file series.

Important: Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT 
Partition for the operation of the Extensible Firmware Interface 
(EFI). This EFI system partition stores programs and information files 
that EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat 
this partition. Whistler supports a new partition style called GUID 
partition table (GPT), which is available only in the Itanium-based 
editions of Whistler. The installation partition on an Itanium-based 
computer must be GPT. You can still read and write to Master Boot 
Record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most computers, but you 
cannot install on one. Dynamic MBR disks can be accessed by x86-based 
computers and Itanium-based computers running Windows 2000 or Whistler 
only. Dynamic GPT disks can be accessed only by Itanium-based 
computers running the Itanium editions of Whistler.

>>> To start Setup on an Itanium-based computer:

1. With the computer turned off, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM 
   drive.

2. Start the computer, and then press any key.

3. Follow the instructions that appear.


======================================================================
4.0   Planning for Unattended Setup
======================================================================

This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions about running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit,
Deployment Planning Guide."

To simplify the process of setting up Whistler on multiple computers,
you can run Setup unattended. To do this, create and use an answer
file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions 
automatically. Then, run Setup from the command line; that is, run 
Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for unattended 
Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system that is 
running when you start unattended Setup:

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
   Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

 * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows
   2000, run Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options selected).

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

 * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
   automated installation), see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource 
   Kit, Deployment Planning Guide."

 * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe, on a computer
   running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Whistler Setup CD in
   the CD-ROM drive and display the command prompt. Then, change to 
   the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt /?

 * To view the command options available for Winnt32.exe, on a
   computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium
   Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Whistler, insert the
   Whistler Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and display the command 
   prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then, change to 
   the CD drive, change to the I386 directory, and type

   winnt32 /?


======================================================================
5.0   Entering Server Settings During Installation
======================================================================

After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup
files are copied to the disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items you will be specifying as
you run Setup. Before working with these sections, see earlier
sections in this text file series for important background information
about issues such as partitions, file system choices, and the handling
of TCP/IP name resolution. You can modify settings after running Setup
by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other configuration
tools.

Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or 
Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass 
Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file. If you have 
specialized hardware requiring a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, see "Using a Custom 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File" earlier in this text file.

5.1   Choosing or Creating a Partition for Whistler
======================================================================

During installation, you can create or specify a partition on which 
you want to install Whistler. You can create a partition from the 
unpartitioned space available, specify an existing partition, or 
delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk space 
for the Whistler partition. If you specify any action that will cause 
information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see "Planning Disk Partitions" earlier in this 
text file series.

Important: If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any 
data on that partition to be erased. Installing Whistler on a 
partition that contains another operating system will cause that 
operating system to be overwritten.

5.2   Selecting Regional Settings
======================================================================

Use this screen to customize language and locale settings. You can
set up Whistler to use multiple languages and regional settings.

5.3   Personalizing Whistler Datacenter Server
======================================================================

Enter your name and, optionally, your organization.

5.4   Specifying a Licensing Mode
======================================================================

Select your client licensing mode. For information about licensing
modes, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" in Datactr1.txt. If you are 
unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change 
once from Per Server to Per Seat at no cost.

5.5   Entering Your Computer Name
======================================================================

Enter a computer name. The recommended length for most languages is
15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space
per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended
length is 7 characters or fewer.

You should use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. 
The standard characters are the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and 
lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character. 

If you are using the Microsoft DNS Service on your network, you 
can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters 
and other nonstandard characters such as the ampersand (&). Using
nonstandard characters might impact the interoperability of 
network software from other companies. For more information about 
DNS, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" earlier in this text file 
series.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running operating systems developed before Windows 
2000 will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name 
only. 

If this computer will be part of a domain, you must choose a computer
name different from any other computer in the domain. If this computer
will contain multiple Whistler Datacenter Server installations, each
installation must be on a separate partition and must have a unique
computer name.

5.5.1   Setting the Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup creates a user account on your computer called Administrator 
that has administrative privileges for managing your computer's 
overall configuration. The Administrator account is intended for the 
person who manages this computer. For security reasons, you should 
specify a password for the Administrator account. Leaving the 
Administrator password box empty indicates no password for the 
account.

The password can have up to 127 characters. For the strongest system
security, use a password of at least 7 characters and use a mixture
of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other characters such
as *, ?, or $.

Important: For security reasons, you should assign a strong password 
to the Administrator account.

The password you type in the Confirm password box must exactly match 
The password you type in Administrator password box. Take special care 
To remember and protect your password. After Setup is completed, for 
the highest security, change the name of the Administrator account (it 
cannot be deleted) and keep a strong password on the account at all 
times. For more information about security and the privileges held by 
the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Whistler 
Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

5.5.2   Choosing Server Components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose among certain components that will make up your server
installation. For information about determining which components you
need, see "Choosing Components to Install" earlier in this text file
series. Components often needed on networks using TCP/IP include DHCP,
DNS, and WINS. To install these components, during Setup, in the
Windows Components dialog box, select Networking Services, click
Details, and then select the component or components you need.

If you complete Setup and then decide you need other components, you
can add the necessary components later. There are two ways to do this:

 * Use the Configure Your Server Wizard. This wizard appears
   automatically when Setup is complete. You can also start this
   wizard at any time by using the following steps: click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Configure Your Server.

   With this wizard, you can install appropriate sets of components
   for domain controllers or member servers, including file
   servers, print servers, Web and streaming media servers, 
   application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and networking 
   and communications servers.

 * Use the Windows Components Wizard. To use this wizard, after
   running Setup, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel. In Control Panel, double-click Add or Remove
   Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components (on the
   left).

   With this wizard, you can choose and install individual
   components.

5.5.3   Setting the Date and Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the date, time, and time zone, and choose whether the system
should automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

5.5.4   Specifying Networking Settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify networking information (for TCP/IP or other
protocols) during Setup, or you can use the Typical settings option 
and then make any necessary changes to your networking configuration 
after installation by using the Configure Your Server Wizard or other
management tools. (For information about using protocols other than
TCP/IP, read the documentation for your network adapter.)

In Setup, you have three choices regarding IP addresses. For important
background information about these choices, see "IP Addresses"
earlier in this text file series. To assign IP addresses, you can:

 * Use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature called Automatic
   Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically assign IP
   addresses. You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses 
   automatically during Setup and then, after Setup, change your 
   configuration to use DHCP, static addressing, or both. To open 
   Whistler Help and Support Services (which includes information 
   about DHCP and static IP addresses), after completing Setup, click 
   Start, and then click Help and Support.

 * Provide for IP addresses to be dynamically assigned in your
   domain by installing and configuring DHCP on a server to which
   you assign a static IP address. If you are not familiar with
   DHCP or the possible choices for a static IP address and its
   associated subnet mask, you should use APIPA, at least initially, 
   as described in the previous paragraph.

 * Assign a static IP address to one or more servers. You must assign
   a server a static IP address if it will provide access to users
   on the Internet. For important information about obtaining an IP
   address, see "IP Addresses" earlier in this text file series.

In addition, during Setup, you can provide the local server with the
IP addresses of any DNS or WINS servers on your network.

>>> To allow Setup to assign or obtain an IP address:

 * In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Typical
   settings.

   Whistler Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server in your
   domain. If there is a DHCP server in your domain, the server
   provides the IP address. If there is no DHCP server in your
   domain, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) assigns an IP
   address.

>>> To specify a static local IP address and settings needed for DNS 
and WINS: 

1. In Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click Custom
   settings.

2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet Protocol
   (TCP/IP).

3. Click Properties.

4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click Use
   the following IP address.

5. In IP address and Subnet mask, type the appropriate numbers (if
   appropriate, specify the Default gateway as well).

6. Under Use the following DNS server addresses, type the address of
   a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate DNS server.

   If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server, type
   the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click the
   WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add the
   IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   If the local server is a WINS server, type the IP address assigned
   in step 5.

8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue through Setup.

5.5.5   Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find such things as printers and
shared folders within that group. You will need to choose between
workgroup and domain, and then specify a name for your workgroup or
domain. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" earlier in this text file series.


======================================================================
6.0   Configuring Your Server
======================================================================

When Setup completes the installation of Whistler, the computer 
restarts. Setup has now performed the basic installation. The 
Configure Your Server Wizard, which will appear on the screen if you
log on as the Administrator, makes further configuration easy. At this 
point, you can register your copy of Whistler Datacenter Server and 
use Configure Your Server.

Also at this point, you can open Whistler Help and Support Services
by clicking Start, and then clicking Help and Support. If you have 
used Windows NT in the past, one of the features you might find useful 
in Whistler Help and Support is New ways to do familiar tasks, 
available in the Help topics or by using Search in Help and Support 
Services.

You can use the Configure Your Server Wizard to finish installing
optional components that you choose during Setup. With this
wizard, you can configure domain controllers or member servers,
including file servers, print servers, Web and streaming media 
servers, application servers, Microsoft SharePoint servers, and 
networking and communications servers.

You can start the Configure Your Server Wizard at any time by
clicking Start, pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative
Tools, and then clicking Configure Your Server. Other configuration

======================================================================
1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, read this section 
to ensure that your equipment meets the minimum requirements and that 
you have the information you will need during Setup.

1.1 Hardware Requirements
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP, make sure your computer meets the
following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 733 megahertz (MHz) Intel Itanium-based microprocessor

   * 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM (minimum)

   * 6 gigabytes (GB) of free hard disk space (minimum) for Setup

   * VGA monitor or better

   * Keyboard

   * Mouse or compatible pointing device

   * CD-ROM drive

For network installation:

   * Windows XP-compatible network adapter card and related cable

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
======================================================================

Windows XP Setup automatically checks your hardware and software
and reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful
installation, however, you should determine whether your computer
hardware is compatible with Windows XP 64-Bit Edition before you 
start Setup. This is particularly important if you are using a 
high-end video card for rendering three-dimensional graphics, or 
if you are using computer peripherals other than the minimum hardware
requirements mentioned in the previous section.

You can view the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft
Web site:

http://www.microsoft.com/hcl

        IMPORTANT: Windows XP 64-Bit Edition supports only those 
        devices listed in the HCL. If your hardware isn't in this 
        list, contact the hardware manufacturer and ask if there's 
        a Windows XP 64-Bit Edition driver for the component. 

During Setup, you can use Dynamic Update to ensure that you are 
getting the most up-to-date Setup files for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

1.3 Obtaining Network Information
======================================================================

The first step is to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you don't know which option to choose or if your
computer won't be connected to a network, select the workgroup option.
(You can join a domain after you install Windows XP.)

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request
the following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer

   * Name of the workgroup or domain

   * TCP/IP address (if your network does not have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during Setup, you must have the correct
hardware installed on your computer and it must be connected by 
a network cable. 

1.4 Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium-based Workstations
======================================================================

Itanium-based computers have specific partitioning requirements. Two 
partitions are created automatically when you install Windows XP 
for the first time on your computer.

*  The first partition is a FAT partition of about 100 megabytes (MB).
   Called the EFI System Partition, this partition is used to store 
   programs and information files that the Extensible Firmware 
   Interface (EFI) uses to automatically start Windows XP.

*  The Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition is a 32 MB partition that 
   allows the operating system to perform operations that require 
   dedicated disk space, such as changing a disk from basic to 
   dynamic.

The EFI system partition is the first partition on your hard disk 
and the MSR partition is the second partition. If you are using 
multiple hard disks, the MSR partition is the first partition 
on your second hard disk and all subsequent hard disks. Only one 
EFI system partition is necessary for a computer, and it must be on 
your boot drive.

For information about EFI utilities, see the documentation supplied
by your computer vendor.

        IMPORTANT: The recommended minimum partition size for 
        installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is 6 GB.

======================================================================
2.0 Installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition
======================================================================

Setup for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is divided into two phases. The
first phase is text-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup copies files 
to the computer, checks your hardware, and configures your 
installation. You can also choose to create multiple partitions during
this phase. Your computer will restart at the end of this phase.

The second phase is GUI-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup gathers 
information such as regional settings, user name and password, and 
network information. Your computer restarts again when Setup is 
complete. 

2.1 Installing for the First Time
======================================================================

Setup creates the EFI system partition and the MSR partition 
automatically. It is recommended that you create a single data 
partition of no less than 6 GB for installing the operating system. 

>> To install Windows XP on a clean machine:

   1. Ensure that the hardware for your Itanium-based computer is 
      set up properly and that everything is attached as it should be.

   2. Turn on your computer.

   3. Insert the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition CD into the CD-ROM
      drive.

   4. When prompted in the EFI Boot Manager, boot to the CD-ROM drive.

      When you see "Press any key to boot from CD-ROM...", press a key
      and Windows XP text-mode Setup begins.

      If the CD does not start automatically, boot to the EFI shell, 
      select the CD-ROM drive, and type:

        setupldr

      and then press ENTER.

      Note: Setup can create the EFI system partition and the MSR 
      partition automatically. If you want, you can choose to create 
      the EFI system partition yourself, but it is recommended that 
      you let Setup create this partition.

   5. When prompted to install Windows, determine the size of 
      your data partition. The recommended minimum size for 
      installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is 6 GB. 

   6. Follow the directions that appear. Once GUI-mode setup is 
      complete, the computer restarts automatically. 

2.2 Installing an Updated Version 
======================================================================

Installing a newer version of Windows XP 64-Bit Edition over a 
previous version is simple. Setup detects and installs the appropriate
drivers, or it creates a report on devices that could not be upgraded,
so that you can be sure your hardware and software are compatible with
Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

>> To update from the CD:

   1. Turn on your computer, and start Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

   2. Insert the Windows XP 64-bit Edition update CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

      If Windows automatically detects the CD, the Windows XP CD
      dialog box appears. Click Install Windows to start your upgrade.

      Otherwise, click Start, and then click Run. Type the following 
      command, replacing "d", if necessary, with the letter assigned 
      to your CD-ROM drive:

      d:\ia64\winnt32.exe 

   3. Press ENTER.

   4. Select Upgrade, and then click Next. 

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.3 Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

Windows XP Setup helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings on
the following pages, depending on the configuration of your computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to
     continue the setup process, select the option labeled "I accept
     this agreement."

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Windows XP installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations. You
     can set up Windows XP to use multiple languages and regional
     settings.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings for
     different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person to 
     whom this copy of Windows XP is licensed and, optionally, the 
     organization.

   * Computer Name and Administrative Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain
     names on your network. Windows XP Setup suggests a computer name,
     but you can change the name.

     Setup automatically creates an Administrator account during 
     installation. When you use this account, you have full rights
     over the computer's settings and can create user accounts on the
     computer. Logging on as an Administrator after you install 
     Windows XP gives you administrative privileges that you need in 
     order to log on and manage your computer. Specify a password for
     the Administrator account. For security reasons, you should 
     always assign a password to the Administrator account. Take care
     to remember and protect your password.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you
     want Windows XP to automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you are an advanced user, select
     Typical settings for your network configuration. To manually 
     configure network clients, services, and protocols, select 
     Custom settings.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must
     join either a workgroup or a domain. For details on both of these
     options, see "Providing Networking Information" in section 2.5 
     of this document.
     
   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who will
     be using your computer. Each person with an account on the
     computer can be assigned different levels of access.

2.4 Providing Networking Information
======================================================================

During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you will not be working on a network, select the 
option to join a workgroup.

2.4.1 Joining a Workgroup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a peer-to-peer network). Any user can join a workgroup by
simply typing the workgroup name--you don't need special permissions
to join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup
name, or you can use the workgroup name that Windows XP Setup
suggests.

2.4.2 Joining a Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, while the
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network
administrator. Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself,
joining a domain requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must already have an
existing computer account in the domain you want to join, or have the
rights to create one. You are prompted to type a new computer account
name. Before you run Windows XP Setup, ask your network administrator
to create a computer account. Or, if you have the appropriate 
privileges, you can create the account during the setup process and 
join the domain. To join a domain, you need to provide your user name
and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Windows XP.

2.5 Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you are a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator 
rights.

>> To create a user account: 

   1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

   2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click User Accounts. 

   3. If your computer is on a domain, click Add and then follow the 
      instructions that appear.

      If your computer is not on a domain, under Pick a task, click 
      Create a new account, and then follow the instructions that 
      Appear on your screen.

======================================================================
3.0 Advanced Setup Options 
======================================================================

This section provides more detailed information and can help you make 
decisions about how you install Windows XP.

3.1 File Systems
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, you should decide which 
file system you will use. A file system is the method by which 
information is stored on a hard disk.

Windows XP supports the NTFS file system or one of the file
allocation table file systems (FAT or FAT32). To set up a dual-boot 
configuration, you should select one file system for all your 
partitions: FAT32 or NTFS.

      NOTE: The 102 MB EFI system partition will automatically use the
      FAT file system. You should not change this, because using 
      another file system will cause problems.

3.1.1 NTFS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The NTFS file system is the recommended file system for use with
Windows XP. It has all of the basic capabilities of FAT, and it
provides the following advantages over the FAT and FAT32 file
systems:

   * Better file security
   * Better disk compression
   * Support for large hard disks, up to 2 terabytes (TB). (The
     maximum drive size for NTFS is much greater than for drives
     formatted as FAT, and as drive size increases, performance 
     with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with FAT.)

3.1.2 FAT and FAT32
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system that can be used
on drives ranging from 512 MB to 32 GB. FAT and FAT32 offer 
compatibility with operating systems other than Windows XP. 

3.2 Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your hard disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. You can create a partition to
provide a place to back up data, or to dual-boot with another 
operating system. When you create partitions on a disk, you divide 
the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by 
a file system, such as FAT32 or NTFS.

During text-mode Setup, you can create and delete partitions. Follow 
these guidelines for partitioning:

*   A minimum of 6 GB is recommended for installing Windows XP 
    64-Bit Edition. A partition of this size provides flexibility 
    for adding future updates, operating system tools, or other 
    files.

*   During Setup, you should create and size only the partition on 
    which you want to install Windows XP. After Windows XP is 
    installed, you can use Disk Management to further partition the 
    unallocated space.

For more information about Disk Management, open Help and Support 
Center from the Start menu in Windows XP Help.

3.3 Modifying the EFI Boot Manager
======================================================================

The EFI Boot Manager enables you to boot to the shell, to Windows XP 
or another operating system, or to the CD-ROM drive. Your computer 
will attempt to boot to each of the listed options, starting with the 
first option, until it finds a valid bootable entry. You can change 
the order of items on the boot menu. For example, if you want to boot 
to the shell first, you can make Shell the first item on your boot 
menu. If you install more than one operating system, you can choose 
which is listed first.

You can also make other changes to the Boot Manager menu, such as 
renaming a boot option or exporting the boot options to a floppy disk.

>> To make changes to your boot options:

   1.  Boot to the EFI shell.

   2.  Switch to the hard disk. Your hard disk is normally located at 
       fs0 or fs1. For example, type

         fs0: 

       and then press ENTER.

   3.  Change to the Msutil folder. Type 

         cd msutil

       and then press ENTER.
       If there is no Msutil folder, you are not in the correct place.
       
       Try a different fs option.

   4.  Use the nvrboot.efi program to modify EFI Boot Manager options.
       To start it, type

            nvrboot

       and then press ENTER.

   5.  Make the changes to your boot options. For example, to rename 
       a boot option, type M to Modify, and then follow the directions
       that appear on your screen. To move a boot option to the top
       of the boot option menu, use the Push command. To save a copy
       of your boot options to a floppy disk, use the Export command.

On computers running Whistler Server, Whistler Advanced Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, the following scenario causes an issue with port rules.
\par Network Load Balancing Manager connects to one host in the clust
er and incorrectly identifies that the remaining hosts in the cluster have the same set of port rules as that host. Network Load Balancing Manager incorrectly identifies that it is connecting to a correctly configured cluster and so displays the port rule
s of the host it is connected to as the port rules for the entire cluster. The user tries to use Network Load Balancing Manager to manage an existing incorrectly configured Network Load Balancing cluster having hosts with mismatched port rules.
\par To work arou
nd this issue, users should ensure that when using Network Load Balancing Manager to connect to an existing operational Network Load Balancing cluster, the cluster is correctly configured. To determine this, run the Wlbs.exe query command at the command p
rompt.

On computers running Whistler Server, Whistler Advanced Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, Network Load Balancing Manager should not be run on a Network
 Load Balancing cluster host when the cluster is configured in unicast mode and each host only has a single network interface card (NIC) in it. This is because in this mode there is no intra-host communication possible and so Network Load Balancing Manage
r will not be able to set Network Load Balancing parameters on hosts other than the one it is running on. 
\par To work around this issue, run Network Load Balancing Manager on a computer that is not a Network Load Balancing cluster host and remotely manage the cluster. This issue will not be addressed in a future release.

The Message Queuing COM object model does not support multiple-element format name 
addressing through the MSMQQueueInfo.FormatName property. To utilize multiple-element format name addressing, use the new object MSMQDestination introduced in Whistler. To work around this issue, set MSMQDestination.FormatName to a multiple-element format
 name and pass the object to MSMQMessage.Send. You can optionally call MSMQDestination.Open before passing it to MSMQMessage.Send.

On computers running Whistler Professional or Whistler Advanced Server, by using MS\~DTC you can turn off certain features such as Transaction Internet Protocol (TIP), Extended Architecture (XA), Net
work Transactions, Network Administration, and Network Clients. This minimizes the security risks involved with running unused features that open network ports or load user DLLs. In addition, MS\~
DTC was also modified from running under the LocalSystem acco
unt to running under the lower privileged Network Service account. This change lessens the potential for damage to the system if there is a security problem. By default, TIP, Network Administration and Network Clients are turned off on all installations. 
In addition, on domain controllers, XA and Network Transactions are also turned off. These features are important because the administrator needs to enable features before existing client software is supported.

\par A user can restore a System State backup to an alternate location by using Ntbackup.exe. An alternate location is a user-specified folder where the 
data will be restored with its original directory structure in place. These restored backup files must be present on a local drive of the computer that will be promoted using Create Replica From Media. 
\par Due to an issue in Beta 2 with restoring large system
 state files, it is not possible to restore an Active Directory backup that is over 40 GB in size to a mapped drive on a remote computer. To work around this issue, copy the backup file to the computer to be promoted and restore it locally on that compute
r. If the backup is on tape, either restore it directly to the computer to be promoted or restore it to a different computer and copy it to the computer to be promoted. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

The caller ID, callback options, static IP address, and static routes properties are designed for a dial-up client dialing into a network access server (NAS). 
\par These settings were not designed for wireless access points. A wireless access points that receives these settings in the }{Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service}{\fs15  (}{\cf0 RADIUS) message from the IAS server might be unable to process these se
ttings and disconnect the wireless client. When IAS is providing authentication and authorization for users who are both dialing in and gaining access to the organization network using wireless devices, the dial-up properties must be configured to either 
s
upport dial-up connections (by setting dial-up properties) or wireless connections (by not setting dial-up properties). In Whistler, you can turn on the processing of the dial-up properties of the user account for some scenarios (such as incoming) and tur
n off the processing of the dial-up properties of the user account for other scenarios (such as wireless and authenticating switch) by configuring the Ignore-User-Dialin-Properties attribute on the }{\cs70\b Advanced}{\cf0 
 tab of the profile settings of a remote access policy. 
\par To turn on the processing of the dial-up properties of the user account, set the Ignore-User-Dialin-Properties attribute at its default value, which is 0. For example, for the remote access policy that is designed for dial-up connections, no addition
al configuration is needed. 
\par To turn off the processing of the dial-up properties of the user account, set the Ignore-User-Dialin-Properties attribute to the value of 1. For example, for the remote access policy that is designed for wireless or authenticat
ing switch connections, set the value of the Ignore-User-Dialin-Properties attribute to 1. 
\par When the dial-up properties of the user account are ignored, remote access permission is determined by the remote access permission setting of the remote access policy. These issues will be addressed in a future release.

annot end the critical Windows Management process. The provider host's lifecycle is fully controlled by Windows Management. The latter automatically restarts the host if it exits for any reason. This effort increases WMI robustness and reliability for app
lications that rely on the key services that WMI provides.
\par For provider security, providers should use the NetworkService security account. This account is intended for services that have no need for extensive privileges, but have the need to remotely commu
nicate with other systems. Using this account eliminates the potential risk that a corrupted or compromised provider could remove the entire computer (or domain, in the case of a domain controller). It also ensures that no privileged information is reveal
ed to a user in case the provider does not correctly impersonate the client's context.

Event providers do not perform operations on behalf of individual subscribers; instead, event providers listen for occurrences or changes in event provider data sources and then start events. This means that event providers access their event 
sources while not impersonating anyone (they rely on the internal event system to perform the appropriate access checks before firing events).
\par Given these security requirements in Whistler, if you load any instance, class, or method provider into LocalSyst

This query specifies a single point in time, irrespective of the time at which it is to be evaluated, at which an event should be generated. I
f the time specified is in the past at the time it is evaluated, then no event occurs. Queries are coded assuming universal time (UTC). All times returned in the __InstanceModificationEvent object represent the current system time in UTC at the time the e
vent was generated.
\par The fundamental unit of time recognized by the time provider is seconds. This means, for example, if a query omits the seconds field, then when all supplied parameters (year, month, day, and so on) match the current time, an event will b
e generated every second that the current time matches the query. The same is true for minutes, hours, and so on. The field UTCOffset is not recognized for event queries. The event queries must be defined in Greenwich mean time (GMT). For instance queries
,
 it represents the time zone offset from UTC time with UTC time itself in time zone UTCOffset = 0. For instance queries there exists one Win32_CurrentTime object for each time zone -12 far west to far east +13. Thus, a total of 26 instances exist. When qu
eried, each instance represents current system time adjusted for that time zone.

When the expert controls the computer requesting assistance, the user can press ESC at
 any time to stop the expert control due to privacy or security reason. Because of strong security, any key combination which includes the ESC key sequence stops the expert control. This includes keys such as ALT+INS, which the system translates to CTRL+E
SC. However, the expert can prompt to re-establish control immediately.

When a request for Remote Assistance is sent, it contains t
he IP address of the computer making the request. This allows the expert's computer to connect back to the caller. If the IP address of the requesting computer is changed (such as by logging out and logging back in a dial-up account or by DHCP), then the 
e
xpert's computer cannot make a connection since it only has the old IP address. This is mainly an issue when an e-mail for assistance is sent and the computer changes its IP address before the expert responds. If possible, the computer requesting assistan
ce should try to keep the same IP address (for example, by not restarting) until the connection is made. If an IP address change is unavoidable, then simply cancel and resend the assistance request. You can do this easily by selecting the }{\cs70\b

For computers requesting assistance that have multiple IP addresses, the helper's computer tries to call back to each reported IP until one succeeds or all fail.

On computers running Whistler Personal, Whistler Professional, Whistler Server, Whistler Advanced Server, or Whistler Datacenter Server, over a slow link (for example,
 a 56 Kbps dial-up connection), Remote Desktop performance is slower than normal with the default Remote Desktop settings. 
\par One possible workaround for this issue is to turn off the wallpaper on the Remote Desktop server computer. However, the user might wish to turn on the wallpaper while using the computer and turn off the wallpaper while working remotely over a slow link.

\par A better workaround for this issue is to change the color depth for the Remote Desktop connection to 256 colors by using the Terminal 
Services Client. This automatically turns off the wallpaper as well as causes the shell to change to the Windows Classic desktop theme for the duration of the remote connection. When the user logs back in directly to the console, the theme returns to the 
Whistler default theme.

On computers running Whistler Personal, Whistler Professional, or Whistler Advanced Server, users might experience problems using Adobe Photoshop\~5.5 if the computer has an Intel Pentium\~3 microprocessor. While using Photoshop\~5.5 or 6.0, the
 system stops responding.
\par The electrical problem on the affected motherboards is triggered by computer operations that use the pathway (called a }{\cs78\i bus}{) between the processor and the random access memory (RAM) for an extended number of microseconds. The opera
ting system or other programs can cause this problem; however, it often appears when using Photoshop because few other programs move memory as rapidly as Photoshop does.
\par Some Photoshop extensions optimize the way Photoshop moves data. Although removing or disabling these extensions can reduce the problem in some computers, this workaround is temporary because it slows the processing speed of Photoshop.
\par This issue occurs with Dell Optiplex GX1 computers and ASUS P2B-F and P3B-F motherboards and might also occur with other motherboards.
