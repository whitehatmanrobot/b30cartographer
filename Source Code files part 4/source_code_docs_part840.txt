MemoryUnitStress Test Description This test verifies that data can be written to and read from the drives on the Memory Units. This test is also a way of generating traffic on the USB bus without intervening with the Gamepads.  Parameters Length MemoryUnits ReadLoops Algorithm for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) Mount Memory Unit on Top Slot of the Gamepad If mount successful MemoryUnitFound++ Mount Memory Unit on Bottom Slot of the Gamepad If mount successful MemoryUnitFound++ } // end For (j = 0; j < 4; j++) If (MemoryUnitsFound != MemoryUnits) error for (j = 0; j < 8; j++)             { If (FoundMemUnit[j] == true) Create File on drive for this Memory Unit             If (handle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)         error         Write random data of size Length to the file For(loops = 0; loops < ReadLoops; loops++) Read data from the file Compare data written with data read If(data written != data read) error } // end else } // end if } // end for(j = 0; j < 8; j++) } // end else UnMount memory units Execution Time About 1 second for a file size of 32Kb.  Dependencies and Limitations Parameters GamePads Description This parameter is an integer that specifies the number of Gamepads that should be connected to the UUT. There can be max of 4 Gamepads and atleast one Gamepad should be connected to a UUT. Default Range 1 to 4 MemoryUnits Description This parameter is an integer that specifies the number of Memory Units that should be connected to the UUT.  There can be upto 4 Gamepads for a UUT and each Gamepad can have upto 2 Memory Units. Therefore a max of 8 Memory Units can be connected to a UUT. Default Range 0 to 8 Length Description This parameter is an integer that specifies the length/size of the file to be written to and/or read from the drives on the Memory Units.  Default 0x1000  // 4Kb Range 4Kb to 100Kb. ReadLoops Description Specifies how many times data that was written to a memory unit is read back and compared to the written contents.  This allows the Memory Unit Stress test to generate more read accesses to the memory units than write accesses, which will lengthen the life of memory units (which have a limit to the number of times they can be written because they are based on flash memory). Default Range 1 to 4294967296 Standard Error Codes The standard error code is a 32 bit hexadecimal number.  The first three digits a unique number assigned to the module.  The middle two digits represent the test number.  The last three digits are unique to a module.  The following table describes the error codes unique to this module.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Instructions for collecting CAP (Call-Attributed-Profile) data on Xbox TitleInstructions for collecting CAP (Call-Attributed-Profile) data on Xbox davidx Normal davidx Microsoft Word 9.0Instructions for collecting CAP (Call-Attributed-Profile) data on Xbox Build kernel, xbdm, and xapilib with profile support You don t have to do this step anymore. Profile support is now enabled by default on DEVKIT builds. Profile support is currently not enabled by default. To enable it, set the environment ENABLE_XPROFILE in your razzle window, e.g. by adding the following line to your setenv.cmd: set ENABLE_XPROFILE=1 Rebuild everything clean. Instrument the code you want to profile This is done by compiling your code with the /fastcap option. E.g. you can add the following line to your sources file: PERFFLAGS=/fastcap Run your code and collect profile data There are two options available to start / stop profile data collection. - Start / stop profile data collection programmatically This is done by calling XProfpControl function (declared in ntos\inc\xprofp.h). NTSTATUS XProfpControl( ULONG Action, ULONG Param Action parameter can be one of the following constants: XPROF_START start profile data collection The low-order WORD of Param specifies the amount of memory to allocate for the profile data buffer (in MB, default is 32). The high-order WORD of Param contains various flag bits. XPROF_DPC_ENABLED flag specifies that DPC calls are to be recorded. XPROF_STOP stop profile data collection Param is ignored XPROF_COMMENT insert your own comment record into the profile data buffer (see info below about profile data record format) Param is a user-defined value that ll be recorded into profile data buffer. - Start / stop profile data collection via the debugger connection This is done by using the xbcap command. xbcap [-x xboxname] start start profile data collection on the Xbox machine xbcap [-x xboxname] stop cap-filename stop profile data collection on the Xbox machine and retrieve the profile data and store it in the specified file The first option gives you more control over exact internal of profile data collection. The second option allows you to collect profile data without having to add any special code. Retrieve profile data to your PC You can run xbcap stop command to retrieve the profile data to your PC and store it in a file. View and analyze the profile data There are several options for viewing the profiling data: Use xbcap dump to convert the profile data into Office Profile Viewer (.OPF) format. And then run offview to analyze the data. xbcap [-s symbol-path] [-dpc] [-idle] dump cap-filename opf-filename -s option is used to specified the symbol search path. If it s not present, the environment variable _NT_SYMBOL_PATH is used by default. idle option is specified, then the idle thread time is not displayed. Rather, the time spent in the idle thread is attributed to the thread that was running before the system switched to the idle thread. dpc option to dump all DPC calls. DPC calls are not dumped by default. offview opf-filename view the profile data  Write our your own utility to perform simple analysis (see the profile data file format description below) Our profile data file has a very simple format. It consists of a fixed header followed by a sequence of profile data records. The file header is 4KB and is defined as: typedef struct {     ULONG version;     ULONG module_count;     struct {         ULONG loadaddr;         ULONG size;         ULONG reserved[2];         CHAR name[48];     } modules[16];     UCHAR reserved[3064]; } XProfpFileHeader; The fields are: version   File version number, 1 for the version defined in this doc module_count   Number of module loaded in the system when the profile data file was created modules   Information about each loaded module loadaddr   module base address in memory size   module size name   module name Each record is defined as: struct { ULONG TimestampHigh; ULONG TimestampLow; ULONG Params[1]; The timestamp fields are common to all record types. It contains the CPU clock cycle count at the time the record is generated. The three most significant bits of the TimestampHigh field is used as control flags, to indicate the record type.  CALL-BEGIN This record is generated just before your code is about to make a function call. It has two parameters: Params[0] is the address of the caller function. Params[1] is the address of the called function.  CALL-END This record is generated just after your code returns from a function call. It has one parameter: Params[0] is the address of the caller function. 010 to 110   reserved  CONTROL record This record is generated when you call XProfpControl. It has two parameters: Params[0] is the control record type and Params[1] is the type-specific parameter. XPROF_START = 1 XPROF_STOP = 2 Params[1] is the current thread ID XPROF_COMMENT = 4 Params[1] is the user-defined parameter you  passed to XProfpControl XPROF_THREAD_SWITCH = 5 This record is automatically generated by the kernel during a thread context switch. Params[1] is the ID of the new thread we re switching to. XPROF_DPC_BEGIN = 6 XPROF_DPC_END = 7 Start and end of a DPC routine. Params[1] is the DPC routine address. The first record of the profile data file is always CONTROL/XPROF_START. But a CONTROL/XPROF_STOP record is not guaranteed to be always present at the end of the file. For each function call your code makes, two records are generated. For example, if Foo calls Bar, you end up with two records: CALL-BEGIN(Foo, Bar, timestamp1) CALL-END(Foo, timestamp2) re currently only profiling the CPU clock cycles. But with the infrastructure in place, we can add options to profile other information (e.g. various perf counters in the processor) when needed.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Building and Maintaining Setup TitleBuilding and Maintaining Setup Jason Cahill Normal.dot Jason Cahill Microsoft Word 10.0DfMF@Building and Maintaining Setup Specification / FAQ Summary Now that we have moved from InstallShield to our own custom install engine, we hope that developers will be able to add their own files to setup. This document describes: How files get into setup How to build a test setup on your machine Our file layout philosophy, so you know where to add your files to setup What is our new setup technology? It is a home brewed installer written by JonT. It is a generic setup engine, but was specifically built with our project s needs in mind. SDK s are a little bit different that other applications like Office, and as such, we needed an installer that could do things like: Install a new build over previous builds without uninstalling When an  upgrade  is completed it needs to update the list of files to uninstall the new version as well as the previous version s files We wanted to support multiple  flavors  of install, including  Complete  and  Tools only.  We also wanted to support  English only files  as well as  Japanese only files. We needed custom code to run before and after file copy to check for specific  prerequisites  like Windows 2000, Visual Studio 6, Processor Pack, etc. Why did we write our own setup? Isn t that wasted effort and dumb? s sad that we had to resort to writing our own setup. We didn t want to write our own setup, but after examining all of the alternatives, it just made sense. We looked at a number of other setup technologies, including: Staying with InstallShield 6.22   fundamentally, I doubt that InstallShield is really as awful as it seemed, but the way our setup worked using it was  mystical  and only truly understood completely by one person. This made it unmaintainable and fragile. IExpress / ActiveSetup   This technology is so brain-dead simple and it did 80% of what we wanted very easily. The reason we chose not to use it was that it didn t provide for multiple install flavors, didn t easily support custom code, and required the use of a single CAB to contain all of the files we wanted to install. This was a real problem because the CAB cannot have hierarchy. On top of this, IExpress is no longer supported internally. These reasons ruled it out.  We took a very serious look at MSI, both rolling our own with tools like WIX (Windows Installer XML) or having hand-holding help with tools like InstallShield for MSI. We opted against this because of the complexity of understanding how it worked. Fundamentally, our installer installer just needs to install source files. The amount of complexity required to just install files with MSI was incredible. On top of that, QFE s and upgrade installs were a nightmare. So, at the end of our investigation, we decided that rolling our own was the only real way to get what we wanted. Where is setup s source code? It lives in our Source Depot tree at: \Private\Setup \common - files shared between the various parts of setup \docs - the home for setup information \mkplist \packer - the sources for xpacker (creator of the setup.exe) \test \uninstall - the sources for the uninstall.exe \unpacker - the sources for the setup.exe - this is where our setup manifest for the XDK lives Where do we store the information that builds XDK setup? \Private\Setup\XDK This directory contain the following contents: xdk.csv - our setup manifest for all build flavors xdk.ini  - the file that tells the setup packer how to build a complete, English setup xdk.ini  - the file that tells the setup packer how to build a complete, Japanese setup What command-line tools help build setup? Just one: xpacker.exe Usage: xpacker [flags] [filename] Packer builds a self-extracting executable as part of a simple setup engine.         -? This message         -t test build (don't emit any files but report errors) It requires a .INI file that describes where to locate the file packing list and the extractor .EXE to bundle in. It builds a .CAB file and a file manifest and attaches these to the extractor executable, which is a setup engine. How do I build a test setup? Follow these steps: make sure you have the setup command-line tools built: dir /s xpacker.exe If this file cannot be found, type: src setup [enter] set up the ini file to build with your configuration: src setup\xdk\eng sd edit xdk.ini notepad xdk.ini This file should look something like this: ; XDK_ENG.INI [PackerSettings] CabPath=.

The only settings you should need to change fall under the [PackerPaths] heading. This section lists the location of directories for files that the packer picks up when it builds the setup.exe file. Each of the paths in this section are referenced by commands in the CSV file, described below. We use environment variables to pick up most things directly from your source depot enlistment. Every file that doesn t come from source depot is a built file. The INI file (by default) assumes that all built files come from our build machine. The environment variable %pdrive% should be set (before running packer) to the location of the build machine. Specifically, you should have run: set pdrive=\\xbuilds\release\usa\3624 If you d like to have the packer test building setup against the files built on your machine (rather than picking up built files from the build machine) you need to modify the packer path: XBOXBINSRETAIL=%Pdrive%\free To point to your build directory: XBOXBINSRETAIL=%_NT386TREE% Save the file and exit notepad. build setup! set pdrive=\\xbuilds\release\usa\<build number> %_NT386TREE%\dump\xpacker  t xdk.ini This command runs the setup packer in  test mode . It will basically test to see if every file it is supposed to install is present. Any missing files will be flagged as errors. What are flavors? What flavors do we use / plan to use? Flavors are used to designate which files should live in which setups. We have multiple setup.exes depending on different user needs. For our setup s purposes, a flavor is a single letter identifier. This identifier has no intrinsic meaning to the packer. It only has meaning to a specific INI file that builds a specific setup.exe. We use flavors so that we can have a single source file (the xdk.csv) for all possible setup.exes that we could ever need or want. We then have multiple INI files (one per setup.exe) that processes the giant csv file and creates a specific install manifest for that flavor of setup.exe. Here are the flavors we currently use: Base. This flavor includes every file in a  Complete  install of the XDK. English. Files with this flavor exist in English setups. Japanese. Files with this flavor exist in Japanese setups. Here are the flavors we are planning to use in the future: CD. This flavor will be used for CD installs. Tools-only. Files with this flavor will exist in the Tools-only install. Can I have multiple flavors for a file? Yes, a CSV command can specify multiple flavors. For example a file marked as BE will only be included in  base+English  installs. Be careful how flavors get combined: A file marked BEJ will only get put in  base+English+Japanese  setups. That means it is unlikely to exist in any setup. Where is the big list of files that we install? What is the format? Source Depot: \private\setup\xdk\xdk.csv The format, as the file extension implies is comma-separated value. This file contains all of the commands to install files, remove old files and directories on upgrade, add and delete registry entries, and create Start Menu shortcuts. Each line of the file performs one action. There are three kinds of legal lines: comment   a line starting with a   symbol. Everything after the ; until the end of the line is ignored. blank line   has no effect. comma-separated value instruction   the action varies, depending on the command. The most common type of lines in the file are the CSV instructions. The number of comma-value pairs on a line depends on the command. We presently support six different commands. Each is described separately, below: Removing a directory and all of its contents: The removedir command is used to permanently kill a directory and all of its subfiles and folders. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <targetdir>, <targetpath>, <targetfile>, <flags> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is removedir. <targetdir> maps to one of the UnpackerPaths in the INI file specified to xpacker. <targetpath> a path to concatenate to the resolved <targetdir> <targetfile> this should be blank. <flags> this can be either empty or  . An   indicated that this removedir should only occur on the first install of the XDK. All subsequent installs will not cause this removedir to occur. Removing a file The remove command is used to permanently kill a file. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <targetdir>, <targetpath>, <targetfile>, <flags> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is remove. <targetdir> maps to one of the UnpackerPaths in the INI file specified to xpacker. <targetpath> a path to concatenate to the resolved <targetdir> <targetfile> this is the name of the file to remove. <flags> this can be either empty or  . An   indicated that this remove should only occur on the first install of the XDK. All subsequent installs will not cause this remove to occur. Deleting a registry entry The delreg command is used to remove a registry entry or tree of entries. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <root key>, <subkey>, <valuename>, <value>, <flags> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is delreg. <rootkey> maps to one of the following options: HKCR   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT HKLM   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE HKCU   HKEY_CURRENT_USER <subkey> is the   to the key you want to delete. <valuename> is the name of the key you want to delete. <value> not used for delreg. <flags> not used for delreg. Adding a registry key The addreg command is used to remove a registry entry or tree of entries. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <root key>, <subkey>, <valuename>, <value>, <flags> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is addreg. <rootkey> maps to one of the following options: HKCR   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT HKLM   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE HKCU   HKEY_CURRENT_USER <subkey> is the   to the key you want to add. <valuename> is the name of the key you want to add.. <value> the value of the key you want to add. <flags> unknown Installing a file The file command is used to install a file. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <sourcedir>, <sourcepath>, <sourcefile>, <targetdir>, <targetpath>, <targetfile>, <flags> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is file. <sourcedir> maps to one of the PackerPaths in the INI file specified to xpacker. <sourcepath> a path to concatenate to the resolved <sourcedir> <sourcefile> this is the name of the file to install. <targetdir> maps to one of the UnpackerPaths in the INI file specified to xpacker. <targetpath> a path to concatenate to the resolved <targetdir> <targetfile> this is the name of the file as it should be named when installed. If this is left blank, then the <sourcefile> name is used. You specify this field to do a  rename  from source to install point. We currently do this with English vs Japanese files that we want to have the same name. Adding a Start Menu shortcut The shortcut command is used to add an icon to the Start menu. Syntax: <flavor>, <command>, <targetdir>, <targetpath>, <targetfile>, <shortcutpath>, <shortcutfile>, <description> Where: <flavor> is the build flavor that this command should execute in. <command> is shortcut. <targetdir> maps to one of the UnpackerPaths in the INI file specified to xpacker. <targetpath> a path to concatenate to the resolved <targetdir> <targetfile> this is the name of the file that you want the shortcut to reference. <shortcutpath>  this is the path to the shortcut in the Start Menu. If this is left blank, then it will resolve to Start -> Program -> Microsoft Xbox SDK. If this is not blank, the value creates folders under this path. <shortcutfile>  the name of the shortcut to create (this ends in .LNK). <description>  the text that you want to appear in the  Description  area of the shortcut s property page. How are lines in the CSV file processed during install? Sequentially from top to bottom. This means you could have a command to remove file  , install file  , and then remove file  . This is a stupid example, but it is possible. Where do I install my files to? Below is a tree layout of our current setup philosophy for placing files. Please try to stick with this as much as possible if you add your own files. +---Doc [help files go here] +---Include [Win32 inc files for Xbox tools] +---Lib [Win32 lib files for Xbox tools] +---Samples s samples] |   +---Win32 [Samples for Win32] |   |   \---Misc [Misc.

Xbox Development Kit for the Xbox(tm) video game console from Microsoft 
March 2001 Release Readme File

Release Notes and Known Issues

This file contains information you need to know before installing 
or uninstalling the Microsoft Xbox Development Kit (XDK) software,
including the Xbox SDK (the tools and documentation). For all 
other XDK release note information, including setting up the XDK 
target system and your development environment, refer to the 
release notes included in your XDK.

This release of the XDK includes an updated target system recovery
disc that contains a new version of the Xbox System Software.
Refer to the Xbox SDK online help for information on updating your
target system. 
__________________________________________________________________

Installation

Installing the latest version of the Xbox SDK is the only step
required on the development system for the March 2001 XDK release,
provided you have already installed a previous version of the SDK.

It is not necessary to uninstall a prior release of the Xbox SDK
before installing this update. If you do not have a prior release
of the Xbox SDK installed, first perform the steps in the section
"No Prior SDK Installed" below.

You must have permissions at the level of Administrator in order
to perform the installation.  Refer to the Microsoft(r) Windows(r) help system
for further information.

To install, insert the March 2001 SDK disc into your development
system CD drive, select Install Xbox SDK - March 2001 from the
installation screen, and follow the instructions. Alternately,
you can download and install the March 2001 XDK Update from the
beta support Web site (www.betaplace.com).

Note: When the installation program copies an updated file to the
SDK directory on your hard disk, it will overwrite the existing
file even if that file has been modified by you since the last SDK
install. For example, if you have made changes to the sample or
tutorial code installed with a previous SDK, but left those modified
files in the same location and with the same filename, the update
will overwrite those files with new versions and you will lose any
changes you might have made. Copy any modified files you wish to
retain to a new location prior to installing the SDK.
__________________________________________________________________

No Prior SDK Installed

If you do not have a prior release of the Xbox SDK installed,
follow these instructions before downloading and running the SDK
update:

1. If you have not already done so, upgrade your development 
   system to Microsoft Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1. For 
   installation instructions, see the Windows 2000 Service Pack 1
   documentation.  

      Note: Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 is the only operating 
      system supported by the Xbox Development Kit. 

2. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Professional. For 
   installation instructions, see the Visual C++ documentation. 

      Note: This step is not necessary if a licensed copy of 
      Visual C++ 6.0 is already installed on the development 
      system.

      Note: It is not necessary to install the Visual C++ Service 
      Pack 3 (included with the copy of Visual C++ 6.0 in the     
      XDK). 

3. Install Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 4 from the Service Pack 4 
   disc included with the XDK. The install program runs 
   automatically when this disc is inserted into the development 
   system CD drive. To install, follow the instructions on the 
   screen. Service Pack 4 does not include an uninstall utility.
   If you want to uninstall Service Pack 4, you must uninstall and
   reinstall Visual C++ 6.0.

4. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Processor Pack from the XDK 
   March 2001 SDK disc. To install, insert the disc into your 
   development system CD drive, select Install Visual C++ 
   Processor Pack from the installation screen, and follow the 
   instructions (the Processor Pack is located in the VCPP 
   directory on the disc). 
__________________________________________________________________

Uninstallation

To uninstall the Xbox SDK:

1. Either run Setup.exe from the root folder of the XDK disc, or
   launch the Add/Remove Programs dialog from the Windows
   Control Panel, select Microsoft Xbox SDK, and then select 
   Change/Remove. 
   
2. Setup will detect the previous installation of the Xbox SDK.
   Follow the instructions on the screen. 

      Note: Uninstalling the Xbox SDK may not delete all files 
      installed with the Xbox SDK. To complete uninstallation, 
      manually delete the Xbox SDK root folder (located at 
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Xbox SDK, by default). 

For uninstallation of Microsoft Visual C++, see the Visual C++ 
documentation. You cannot uninstall Visual C++ Service Pack 4 or 
the Processor Pack separately.

This document lists the TCRs and identifies whether the title developer can conduct the objective measure part of the test. Most of the TCRs include in the object measure a simple series of steps that can be performed without additional tools or information (TCR). Other TCRs req or code does not exist. Though Microsoft has not published the tools used for this process, the title developer simply needs to avoid accessing the hardware directly in these areas to avoid failing the TCR. In a few cases, the TCR outlines a test that cannot be verified by the title developer.  In these instances, Microsoft performs the test using facilities or means not presently available to the title developer (

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Xbox for PC Developers TitleXbox for PC Developers Colin James O'Neill Normal Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 9.0ays: It has a hard disk, an Intel CPU, an NVIDIA graphics chip, a Microsoft  Windows  2000 based operating system, Winsock, and a Microsoft  Visual C++ based development system. However, the Xbox game system is not a personal computer; it differs from a PC in important ways. Although PC knowledge and skills will be easy to apply on the Xbox game system, developing great software for the Xbox game system is by no means the same as developing great software for a computer, and straight ports are not acceptable. That doesn't mean that developing software for the Xbox game system will be more difficult; to the contrary, many of the complications of PC development are gone, such as scaling across different hardware. By the same token, however, the technical bar for Xbox games will be very high, and meeting that bar will require careful attention to the unique aspects of the Xbox game system. This paper will introduce the major differences to be aware of to make a successful transition from development for computer games to development for Xbox games.  These are the main things to keep in mind:  The Xbox game system is a console that exists only for gaming.  The hardware is fixed and will never, ever change.  The Xbox system software is based on Microsoft  Win32 , but many of the Win32 APIs and features aren't there because they aren't needed on a fixed-hardware game system that doesn't have virtual memory. Also, many of the libraries that are present in the Xbox system software differ from their PC counterparts.  Users have specific expectations: plug and play, instant access to games, no installation, no patches, no extensive controller configuration, and the possibility of an arcade-like experience.  Xbox is a console This may sound obvious, but the Xbox game system is a console, built specifically to play games. This drives all aspects of the design; features that games cannot use are not present. The personal computer serves as a general-purpose appliance, built to support multipurpose software of any sort; the Xbox console serves as a game appliance, built to support the best games possible. Anything that detracts from that goal is not part of the design for example, adding system software support for multitasking (as opposed to threading, which is fully supported) at the cost of memory and full control of performance by the game. Keep this in mind while reading the rest of this document, because it defines the basis for the differences between the Xbox game system and the PC.  Fixed hardware The biggest difference between the Xbox game system and the PC is that the Xbox game system is a fixed, closed hardware platform. Every Xbox console will have the same Intel CPU, with a 16-kilobyte (KB)/16-KB code/data (32 KB total) L1 cache, a 128-KB L2 cache, and a 133-megahertz (MHz), 64-bit front-side bus. Likewise, each Xbox console will have the same NVIDIA graphics chip (GPU), running at the same speed; the same 200-MHz, 128-bit double data rate random access memory (DDR RAM) yielding 6.4 gigabit (Gbit)/sec memory bandwidth; the same 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM; the same hard disk and DVD drive; and the same input controller. Thus, software compatible with the Xbox game system will run exactly the same way on every Xbox console. This will be a new experience for developers accustomed to writing software that must span several generations of and many models of computer graphics chips, each with its own feature set and quirks (not to mention driver revisions) but it should be a good experience. If nothing else, the benefits of having to test a game on only one driver/hardware combination are tremendous. Just as gratifying is the ability to carefully tune a game's software, models, and artwork to maximize use of the hardware. These advantages alone should enable a good Xbox game to outperform a game running on an equivalently powerful computer. To put it another way, when you write a game on a PC, you don't push it to the limit because you have to span a wide range of hardware. On the Xbox game system, you do.  As another example, a game title can rely on the DVD's seeking and streaming speed to be the same in every Xbox console, so the game developer can assume a consistent level of performance when designing the game's model, texture, and audio management. Yet another example is that the input controller is fixed, so every feature of the buttons and controls can be used without complications.  Many things available on PCs are not available on Xbox The Xbox game system gives developers considerably more ability to leverage the hardware, but the flip side is that it demands more from them as well. As a prime example, the Xbox game system doesn't support virtual memory, so developers must carefully manage their memory footprint to stay within the 64-MB limit at all times. Memory management is no longer a matter of blindly allocating memory as needed and trying to stay  reasonably  small; every allocation must be accounted for and charged against the 64-MB limit. Basically, the resources in the Xbox game system are set for all time, with no   whatsoever. The developer has complete control and complete responsibility, and is given freedom to take the Xbox game system as far as it can go at the cost of a number of features that simplify development but interfere with getting the most from the hardware.  Again, the bottom line is that the Xbox game system is a console a console with some nice features from computers, but a game system nonetheless.  In addition to lacking virtual memory, the Xbox game system lacks some other features you would expect from a computer. Of course, the game system has no keyboard and no mouse. There's a screen, but normally it's a TV, although it can be high-definition television (HDTV) or a VGA-compatible monitor. In TV mode, the Xbox game system outputs 640   480 interlaced, and, due to the NTSC signal, can reliably support only 40-column text. The Xbox Dashboard that comes up when no DVD is inserted is nothing like Microsoft  Windows Explorer, and of course there's no windowing.  Also missing are many familiar Win32 APIs. The Xbox game system has no Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which means no system software support for fonts or bitmaps, and most of Win32 USER is missing as well. Unnecessary API sets such as printing and remote procedure call (RPC) are gone. The Xbox game system supports Unicode but not ANSI nor double-byte character set (DBCS). Microsoft  Direct3D , Microsoft  DirectSound , Microsoft  DirectMusic , and Microsoft  DirectPlay  are supported. However, there will be no support for Microsoft  DirectDraw  (integrated into Direct3D), Microsoft  DirectShow  (to be replaced by a new library), Microsoft  DirectInput , Microsoft  DirectSetup, and Application Manager (not applicable for the Xbox game system).  All supported Win32 APIs are listed in  Base Services Functions  in the Xbox Development Kit. Note that many APIs will change to meet the unique requirements of the Xbox game system, in particular because it lacks a general allocator backed by virtual memory for use by system software.  The Xbox game system has a hard disk, but it is organized quite a bit differently than under the Windows platform. The hard disk is sandboxed into several areas for saved games, game-controlled caching (contents saved between games), scratch space (contents not saved between games), system use, and online downloads. Games that need the higher performance of the hard disk (for faster random-access streaming of audio, for example) need to be able to copy the appropriate data over to the hard disk without making the user wait, so background copying while the game starts to run is mandatory. Also, the system can reclaim cached files whenever another game needs cache space, so a game has to be able to deal with deletion of cached files. There are limitations on how much space a game can rely on having available for scratch space and cached files, on what files and parts of the disk a program can access, and on how big saved games can be.  All controllers are universal serial bus (USB) devices, and games must be able to handle, on the fly, the case in which a user plugs in a controller during gameplay. Memory cards plug into the controllers and will be visible to the game system as a storage destination. Telephone and broadband modems are options, the former as USB devices and the latter as Ethernet devices. Games should be able to save to the hard disk or the memory cards. For this reason, saved games should be no larger than 8 MB. Many things are different because Xbox is different Even things that are familiar from the computer are often a bit different on the Xbox game system, both because the Xbox game system is a fixed platform and because it is a console. For instance, because the Xbox game system lacks virtual memory, the libraries have to be able to operate out of a fixed memory pool controlled by the game. Also, the system software runs at Ring 0 to support the best possible performance and to give games full access to the hardware of the Xbox game system. Lastly, all of the system software except the kernel is in the form of libraries stored on the game's DVD, so each game effectively ships with its own customized and tested version of the system software. Again, the game developer is responsible for resource management; only the bits of the system software that a game actually needs should be linked in.  DirectX for the Xbox game system differs substantially from the the PC version. For one thing, every feature of the GPU is exposed, such as the register combiners' support for dual multiplies, dot-products, conditional tests, three outputs per stage, and extra writable registers relative to the PC version of DirectX 8.0. For another, legacy support for older versions of DirectX has been removed. Also, the libraries have been changed to reflect the lack of virtual memory; the game has much more control over the memory footprint of DirectX than on a PC. Many cases can't fail on the Xbox game system, resulting in less need to check for error returns.  One significant difference in DirectX is the result of the Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) of the Xbox game system, in which the CPU, GPU, and audio processor all share a single memory space. In particular, the UMA eliminates the copying of vertices and textures from system memory to video memory, a process that can substantially slow down computers. An Xbox game can stream a texture from the DVD into memory and have the GPU use it immediately. One implication is that textures should be stored in the swizzled format that is most efficient for the GPU because there's no longer a copy step to perform the swizzle as part of unlocking the texture.  Bottom line: Xbox is a console The long and the short of it are that the Xbox game system is a console and PC games aren't going to port right over. However, the Xbox game system takes many good features from computers and adapts them for a fixed platform, so it'll be easy to apply PC knowledge and skills to programming for the Xbox game system. It'll be exciting to see how far developers can push the potent combination of computer technology and the fixed hardware of the Xbox game system.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox Secure Network Library Title _PID_HLINKSXbox Secure Network Library Colin James O'Neill Normal.dot Colin James O'Neill Microsoft Word 10.0y. Secure communication is one of the foundations of the Xbox. The Xbox Secure Network Library (SNL) handles all Xbox communication, whether that communication is Xbox(Xbox or Xbox(server. The Xbox SNL is based on the Winsock API, with one very important difference: it s cryptographically secured. Packets are encrypted (by default) and stamped with authenticating hash values. When an Xbox receives a packet, the packet can be verified against the hash value. If any data has been changed in transit, the packet will fail authentication and will be thrown away. This solves the issues of packet tampering at a very low level. Games themselves don t need to support any additional mechanism for preventing these types of game cheats. Authentication is always enabled. Encryption is enabled by default but may be turned off on a per-socket, per-message basis to increase performance. Converting existing Winsock code to use the Xbox Security Network Library is a matter of calling some new initialization functions and establishing a secure connection. Once a connection has been established, the standard Winsock calls apply. The code snippets below are based on the WinsockPeer sample in the Xbox SDK, a simple peer-to-peer Xbox game. See the WinsockPeer code for the full implementation of the concepts shown. In the code examples, error checking has been removed for clarity. Your game should check for and handle errors appropriately. Checking the Xbox Connection Status Xbox titles must allow the player to play a network multiplayer game only when the Xbox is physically connected to another Xbox via an Xbox System Link Cable or connected to a hub. A title can detect a valid physical connection by calling XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus(). This function can be safely invoked prior to calling any network initialization routines. If the function returns zero, the Xbox is not connected. Otherwise the Xbox is connected, and additional information about the connection is provided in the return value. BOOL IsXboxConnected()    DWORD dwStatus = XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus();    return( dwStatus != 0 ); To meet Xbox Technical Certification Requirements (TCRs), the connection status must be checked in the main game loop at least once per second, and the game must display appropriate UI informing the player that the network cable was disconnected. XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus() is very fast, on the order of three to four microseconds. Initializing the Xbox Network Library Once the connection status has been verified, the game can initialize the Xbox SNL. There are two initialization routines required: XNetStartup() and the standard Winsock WSAStartup(). For the default SNL parameters, call XNetStartup() with NULL.  // Default SNL initialization INT err = XNetStartup( NULL ); To customize the parameters, use the XNetStartupParams structure. Set the first field to the size of the structure (used for versioning). To obtain a default parameter, set that parameter to zero. The default settings are documented in the winsockx.h header file. // Change receive buffer size to 32 K (default is 16 K) // All other parameters will be set to default values XNetStartupParams xnsp; ZeroMemory( &xnsp, sizeof(xnsp) ); xnsp.cfgSizeOfStruct = sizeof(xnsp); xnsp.cfgSockDefaultRecvBufsizeInK = 32; INT err = XNetStartup( &xnsp ); Once the Xbox SNL has been successfully initialized, call WSAStartup() to do the standard Winsock initialization. The Xbox allows all versions of Winsock up through 2.2 (that is, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2), although it technically supports only and exactly what is specified in the Xbox network documentation, not necessarily the Winsock functional specification. // Init Winsock WSADATA wsaData; INT err = WSAStartup( MAKEWORD(2,2), &wsaData ); The network library can be shut down and removed from memory by calling WSACleanup() and then XNetCleanup(). System Link Play Xbox system link play is in effect when any of the following are true: An Xbox is directly connected to another Xbox using the system link cable. A system link cable is simply an Ethernet crossover cable.  An Xbox is connected to an Ethernet hub (bridge) with an Ethernet cable. To meet TCRs, a maximum of 16 Xbox consoles can communicate with each other via a hub. An Xbox is connected to a local area network (LAN). Up to 16 Xbox consoles on the same subnet can communicate with each other. The Xbox does not support communication across different subnets. The Xbox does not officially support LAN play. In other words, LAN play will work for many players (those on the same subnet), but not necessarily all players (those on different subnets). In general, system link play describes an Xbox that is  connected  but not on the Internet. Because games running in system link mode don t have access to any external servers, including DNS or Xbox servers, they must advertise and discover their own game sessions. The following sections describe how games can support system link play. Many of these techniques will also apply to Internet games, but this paper focuses specifically on system link play. Finding a Game Once a game has verified its connection status and initialized the SNL, it can discover if any Xbox consoles are hosting game sessions. With system link play, there are no external servers that track game sessions, so the only way to discover active game sessions is to send a message to all connected Xbox consoles via an Ethernet broadcast. To create a broadcast socket, create a UDP socket and set the SO_BROADCAST option. The following code creates a broadcast socket. // Create UDP socket SOCKET sBrd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP ); // Set broadcast option BOOL bBroadcast = TRUE; INT err = setsockopt( sBrd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_BROADCAST,                       (const char*)&bBroadcast,                       sizeof( bBroadcast ) ); Use this socket to broadcast a game discovery message. This message can contain any useful information about the requesting client, but it will typically have only two important pieces of data: A message ID. If multiple types of messages are issued on the same port, the message ID is used to distinguish the message payloads. If the only messages issued on a given port are game discovery messages, then the port itself is the identifier and the message ID is not required. A nonce used to uniquely identify the client. A nonce is a random number used for a single transaction. When an active game session is discovered, the host cannot reply directly to us, because we don t have a secure channel established yet. The host must instead broadcast a response to all connected Xbox consoles. To distinguish between our game discovery request and other requests, the host replies with the same nonce that it received. Use a nonce of at least 8 bytes to minimize the chance of duplicates. // Game discovery message payload struct FindGame    BYTE ID;    BYTE Nonce[8]; The Xbox API includes a function that can be used to generate nonces called XNetRandom(). For details on this function, see the section entitled Random Number Generation. // Generate nonce and fill out discovery message payload FindGame findGame; findGame.ID = MSG_FIND_GAME; INT err = XNetRandom( findGame.Nonce, sizeof(findGame.Nonce) ); Now the game discovery request can be issued by broadcasting the message to all connected Xbox consoles. For security, any broadcast message sent by an Xbox is always automatically encrypted. The following code shows how to issue a broadcast game discovery message. Use the broadcast socket created above. The port number you choose for broadcast messages is entirely up to the game. Any port number in the range 1 through 65535 is valid. // Create broadcast address SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_BROADCAST; saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); // Broadcast the message to all system link Xbox consoles INT err = sendto( sBrd, (const char*)(&findGame),                   sizeof(findGame), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                    sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN) ); The discovery phase must last no longer than three seconds (a system link TCR). If no responses have been received within that time, no game hosts are available and the title should display an appropriate message. If a response is received, it will contain information about the game host that will allow a secure connection to be established. Multiple responses may be received, indicating that there are multiple game hosts on the network. The Xbox SNL ensures that a title will only send messages to and receive messages from other Xbox consoles running the same game. Details about the host response are given in the next section. Hosting a Game Hosting a game requires the same networking startup sequence as described above. To host a game, a title must additionally acquire its Xbox address and create a session key that uniquely identifies the game. An Xbox address is called an XNADDR. The XNADDR structure contains the information required to completely and uniquely identify any Xbox on either a system link network or on the Internet, even if that Xbox is communicating through network address translation (NAT). The component of the XNADDR structure used by system link play is the Ethernet media access control (MAC) address of the Xbox. To acquire the Xbox address, call XNetGetTitleXnAddr(). This call is asynchronous, because it requires a few seconds to acquire the IP address. When linking with the current version of the secure library (XNETS.LIB), this call is synchronous, because it only acquires the Ethernet MAC address, but in future online releases, this function will also acquire the IP address, so it s important to check the return value and handle the XNET_GET_XNADDR_PENDING condition. XNADDR xnHostAddr; DWORD dwStatus;    // Repeat while pending; OK to do other work in this loop    dwStatus = XNetGetTitleXnAddr( &xnHostAddr ); } while( dwStatus == XNET_GET_XNADDR_PENDING ); // Error checking if( dwStatus == XNET_GET_XNADDR_NONE )    return FALSE; To create a session identifier, call XNetCreateKey() and XNetRegisterKey(). The XNetCreateKey() function generates an XNKID/XNKEY pair by filling both structures with random numbers. See the section Random Number Generation for more details. The XNetRegisterKey() function informs the network stack to  listen  for incoming requests from other Xbox consoles that are using the same session key. XNKID xnHostKeyID; XNKEY xnHostKey; INT err = XNetCreateKey( &xnHostKeyID, &xnHostKey ); err = XNetRegisterKey( &xnHostKeyID, &xnHostKey ); When a game session is finished, call XNetUnregisterKey() to stop accepting packets from any Xbox that is using the matching XNKID/XNKEY session. Once the title has acquired its Xbox address and has registered a session, it s ready to accept game discovery messages and reply with information about the game. The following code creates a socket that listens for broadcast messages. // Create UDP socket SOCKET sLBrd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP ); // Bind to INADDR_ANY SOCKADDR_IN sa; sa.sin_family = AF_INET; sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; sa.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); INT err = bind( sLBrd, (const sockaddr*)( &sa ),                 sizeof( SOCKADDR_IN ) ); // Make socket non-blocking DWORD dwNonBlocking = 1; err = ioctlsocket( sLBrd, FIONBIO, &dwNonBlocking ); In the main game loop, check to see if any game discovery messages have been sent from other Xbox consoles. // See if any game discovery broadcasts have been received FindGame findGame; INT iBytes = recv( sLBrd, (char*)(&findGame),                             sizeof(findGame), 0 ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(findGame) )    if( findGame.ID == MSG_FIND_GAME )       // reply with  game found  message Game clients need four important pieces of information to verify the discovery message, display useful information about the session, and establish a secure connection to the game host: The nonce received from the client must be sent back so that the client can verify that this response is meant for him. A secure connection between the host and the client hasn t been established yet, so the host must reply with a broadcast message. In order to distinguish the message, the client must compare the nonce it generated with the nonce it receives back from the host. If the nonces match, the message was meant for the client. If not, the client must ignore the message, because it was meant for a different Xbox console. The session name. If the client displays this name in the list of sessions that can be joined, the session name must be broadcast. The name must be a non-technical descriptive name for the session (system link TCR). The XNKID/XNKEY pair of the host session. This data will enable a secure session to be established between the host and the client. The XNADDR of the host. This address will allow messages to be sent directly to the host rather than broadcast to all Xbox consoles. // Game found message payload struct GameFound    BYTE   ID;           // message ID    WCHAR  GameName[32]; // generated by host    BYTE   Nonce[8];     // copy of nonce from client    XNKID  KeyID;        // from XNetCreateKey()    XNKEY  Key;          // from XNetCreateKey()    XNADDR HostAddr;     // from XNetGetTitleXnAddr() // Fill out game found message GameFound gameFound; gameFound.ID = MSG_GAME_FOUND; lstrcpynW( gameFound.GameName, gameName, 32 ); CopyMemory( gameFound.Nonce, findGame.Nonce, 8 ); // from client CopyMemory( &gameFound.KeyID, &xnHostKeyID, sizeof(XNKID) ); CopyMemory( &gameFound.Key, &xnHostKey, sizeof(XNKEY) ); CopyMemory( &gameFound.HostAddr, &xnHostAddr, sizeof(XNADDR) ); The following code shows a typical response by the host to a game discovery message. This message is sent using the same style of broadcast socket that the client used to send the discovery message. As mentioned earlier, broadcast messages are always encrypted.  // Create broadcast address using INADDR_BROADCAST SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_BROADCAST; saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_BROADCAST_PORT ); // Broadcast the message to all system link Xbox consoles INT err = sendto( sBrd, (const char*)(&gameFound),                    sizeof(gameFound), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                   sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN)); Depending on the type of game, additional information could well be included in this message, including the name of the hosting player, the number of players currently in the game, and game statistics. Connecting to a Game The client that issued the discovery request can wait up to three seconds to get the list of available hosts (system link TCR). The discovery response is received using the same style of listening socket that the host used when listening for discovery messages. Ignore messages with non-matching nonces, because they are intended for other Xbox consoles that are running the same game and also happen to be in game discovery mode. // See if any hosts have responded to game discovery GameFound gameFound; INT iBytes = recv( sLBrd, (char*)(&gameFound),                             sizeof(gameFound), 0 ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(gameFound) )    if( gameFound.ID == MSG_GAME_FOUND &&        memcmp( &gameFound.Nonce, findGame.Nonce, 8 ) == 0 )       // add the session info to the list of sessions Depending on the type of game and the number of sessions, a title may automatically select a session or present the list of sessions and allow the player to choose. Once a session has been selected, the client must register the game s session keys and translate the host XNADDR to an Internet address (IN_ADDR) that can be used to communicate directly with the host. The XNetRegisterKey() function informs the network stack to  listen  for incoming messages from other Xbox consoles that are using the same session key. INT err = XNetRegisterKey( &gameFound.KeyID, &gameFound.Key ); The XNetXnAddrToInAddr() function converts an Xbox XNADDR to an IP address that is usable by Winsock to communicate directly with that Xbox. The translation requires the session key ID. Be aware that this IN_ADDR is not a   IP address. It has the format 0.x.y.z. If an IN_ADDR is transmitted to another Xbox or a PC, the target Xbox/PC cannot use the IN_ADDR, because it is useful only in the context of the Xbox that converted the address. One way to think of the IN_ADDR is as a  handle  to the actual XNADDR. The Xbox SNL knows how to convert this handle into the XNADDR. IN_ADDR inHost; INT err = XNetXnAddrToInAddr ( &gameFound.HostAddr,                                &gameFound.KeyID, &inHost ); Now both the host and the client have registered the same session key and the client knows the host s unique Xbox address. Now the client can send messages directly to the host. No more broadcast messages are required. The port number you choose for non-broadcast messages is entirely up to the game. Any port number in the range 1 through 65535 is valid. Here s an example of how the client might issue a  join game  message to the host. struct JoinGame    BYTE ID;              // message ID    WCHAR PlayerName[32]; // name of player that wants to join // Generate the message payload JoinGame joinGame; joinGame.ID = MSG_JOIN_GAME; lstrcpynW( joinGame.PlayerName, playerName, 32 ); // Talk directly with the host SOCKADDR_IN saSendTo; saSendTo.sin_family = AF_INET; saSendTo.sin_addr = inHost; // from XNetXnAddrToInAddr saSendTo.sin_port = htons( GAME_DIRECT_PORT ); // Send message directly to host INT err = sendto( s, (const char*)(&joinGame),                    sizeof(joinGame), 0,                   (const sockaddr*)(&saSendTo),                   sizeof(SOCKADDR_IN)); From this point on, all messages sent between the player and the host can be sent using standard socket calls. The Xbox SNL automatically handles the underlying key exchanges, authentication and encryption of the messages. Any message that has been tampered with or is otherwise bogus will be detected and ignored by the Secure Network Library and will never be propagated to the game. Allowing Players To Join When the host game is allowing players to join, it must listen for join messages. Join messages are sent directly from a client Xbox to the host Xbox, so the host Xbox can determine where the message originated. This allows the host to determine the XNADDR of the client. In the game loop, check to see if any join messages have been sent from other Xbox consoles. Note the use of recvfrom() to determine the source of the message. // See if any game join requests have been received. // Socket s has been bound to INADDR_ANY, GAME_DIRECT_PORT. JoinGame joinGame; SOCKADDR_IN saFrom; INT iSize = sizeof( SOCKADDR_IN ); INT iBytes = recvfrom( s, (char*)(&joinGame), sizeof(joinGame),                         0, (sockaddr*)(&saFrom), &iSize ); if( iBytes != SOCKET_ERROR && iBytes == sizeof(joinGame) )    if( joinGame.ID == MSG_JOIN_GAME )       // handle join game message (see below) At this point, we have a valid  join game  message and we have some information about the Xbox who sent the message. Specifically, we have the IN_ADDR of the source Xbox. Again, this IP address is not a   IP address. The host can continue to use this IN_ADDR to communicate with the client Xbox for the duration of the session, but if the host wants to send this Xbox address to other Xbox consoles, the IN_ADDR must be translated to an XNADDR. To translate an IN_ADDR to an XNADDR, use XNetInAddrToXnAddr(). The last parameter of the function is the optional XNKID that can be used to retrieve the session key ID associated with the address. In this case, the host already knows the session key ID, so we pass NULL. XNADDR xnClient; INT err = XNetInAddrToXnAddr( saFrom.sin_addr, &xnClient, NULL ); s up to the title to decide how to handle join requests. If the game is already full, it will most likely issue a  join failed  response. If the join is allowed, the game will respond with a  join approved  message. It may also send additional information about the game and other players in the game. Distributing Xbox Addresses System link games can choose whatever policy they wish when it comes to player communication. The host can act as the server and all communication can happen between the host and each player (client-server model), or the host can distribute the addresses of all of the Xbox consoles participating in the game and each player can communicate directly with the other players (peer-to-peer model). To distribute Xbox addresses, the host typically sends the XNADDR of each existing player when a new player joins the game. After that, whenever a new player joins, the host sends the XNADDR of the new player to each existing player. When a game receives notification of a new player XNADDR, it translates the XNADDR to an IN_ADDR using XNetXnAddrToInAddr() and the game session key ID (XNKID). After the translation, the title can throw away the XNADDR (unless it intends to forward the address to another Xbox) and use the IN_ADDR for all future communication. Never send an IN_ADDR on the wire, because it is useless outside of the Xbox that owns it. Each Xbox must do its own translation of XNADDRs to IN_ADDRs, because each Xbox network stack has its own local table of XNADDRs / IN_ADDRs. Handling Player Disconnects Game developers that write networked PC games often assume that the way a player leaves a networked game is via the UI, which typically invokes a standard termination of sockets (for example, shutdown(), closesocket(), or WSACleanup()). On the Xbox, the ways a player will commonly leave a networked game are by turning off the Xbox or rebooting into a different game. Therefore a game should never rely on a socket getting closed to indicate that a player has left the game. There are two common methods for detecting when a player has left or a connection has been dropped. One way is to periodically send the other players an  are you there?  message (ping) and see if they respond. Another method is for every player to periodically broadcast an  m here  message (heartbeat). Each player keeps track of the other player s heartbeats, and when players don t hear a heartbeat in a fixed period of time, they assume that player left. The WinsockPeer sample in the Xbox SDK uses the heartbeat method, sending heartbeats three times per second and timing out players who haven t sent a heartbeat for two or more seconds. UDP vs. TCP The Xbox SNL supports both UDP and TCP protocols. Both protocols are always authenticated and both are encrypted by default. UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol. UDP packets may arrive out of order, and they may never arrive at all. UDP packets are smaller than TCP packets and generally exhibit better performance. Broadcast messages by definition require UDP. TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol. TCP packets are re-sent if they cannot be delivered and are guaranteed to arrive in the order they were sent. TCP packets are larger than UDP packets. For system link play, it s uncommon to see UDP packet loss or packet out-of-order issues. UDP is also a better protocol choice for performance reasons. Most multiplayer games choose UDP for these reasons, and many games create their own  reliable UDP  protocols on top of UDP. If performance is not an essential game requirement but reliable packets are key, choose TCP. XNet Library Versions There are four different versions of the Xbox SNL library, described below. In general, development work will take place using XNET.LIB or XNETD.LIB, and shipping titles will use XNETS.LIB. XNET and XNETD Developer Libraries XNETD version includes debugging information, assertions, symbols, and so on. XNET version does not have debugging enabled. Use these libraries for games in development. Allow remote debugging of the game. Allow communication with PCs and other untrusted hosts if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns the debugger IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. XNetGetTitleXnAddr() returns the title IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. XNETSD Secure Library Includes debugging information, assertions, symbols, and so on. Use this library for final debugging stages of game or security testing. Allows remote debugging of the game. Does not allow communication with untrusted machines, with the exception of the debugger, even if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns the debugger IP address in the ina field of the XNADDR. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() is empty. XNETS Secure Libraries Use this library for shipping titles. Titles must link with this library to pass system link TCRs. Does not allow remote debugging; must use hard disk logging or other methods for debugging. Does not allow communication with PCs, even if XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY is specified in XNetStartup(). XNetGetDebugXnAddr() returns XNET_GET_XNADDR_NONE. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() is empty. Communicating with Development Systems By default, an Xbox console may communicate with another Xbox console only using secure communication. All versions of the XNet libraries support secure communication between Xbox consoles. However, if you are linking with the XNet developer libraries (either XNETD.LIB or XNET.LIB), you can also communicate with  untrusted  devices, including PC development systems. To enable communication to untrusted hosts, set the XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY parameter when calling XNetStartup(). XNetStartupParams xnsp; ZeroMemory( &xnsp, sizeof(xnsp) ); xnsp.cfgSizeOfStruct = sizeof(xnsp); xnsp.cfgFlags = XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY; INT err = XNetStartup( &xnsp ); On Xbox development systems, the Xbox IP address is available on the main menu of the XDK Launcher. There are two IP addresses, because the Xbox has two network stacks. You can toggle through the addresses by pressing the Black button on the controller. The   address is the address of the debug stack. The debug stack is used by XBDM for remote debugging. Microsoft  Visual Studio  uses this IP address to communicate with the Xbox during remote debugging. The   address is the address of the title stack. The title stack is used by games for game networking. The Xbox title IP address can be retrieved programmatically by games linked with the developer library by accessing the XNADDR ina field from the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr(). The debug address can be similarly found using XNetGetDebugXnAddr(). From the PC side, an application may call DmGetAltAddress() to retrieve the title IP address for the Xbox. For more details, see the Debugger API section in the Xbox Development Kit documentation. The code shown above will compile and link successfully with the Xbox secure libraries (XNETS.LIB and XNETSD.LIB), but the XNET_STARTUP_BYPASS_SECURITY parameter will be ignored, and connections to untrusted hosts will fail. The ina field of the XNADDR returned by XNetGetTitleXnAddr() will also be empty. When linking with XNETSD.LIB, the debugging version of the secure library, only XBDM (debugger) communication is allowed to untrusted hosts. In other words, XNetGetDebugXnAddr() will return the IP address of the debug stack when linking with XNETSD.LIB, but XNetGetTitleXnAddr() will not return a valid IP address when linking with either XNETSD.LIB or XNETS.LIB. Random Number Generation For maximum security, use the XNetRandom() function whenever you need to generate nonces or other random data sent on the wire. All random keys (including XNKID/XNKEY pairs), nonces, and encryption initialization vectors created by the Xbox SNL are generated using this function. XNetRandom() uses an algorithm for generating random bits based on RFC 1750 (Randomness Recommendations for Security; see   HYPERLINK "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1750.html"  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1750.html ). Randomness is not based on predictable pseudo-random mathematical number generators. Instead, randomness is generated using a combination of random input sources, including physical sources of entropy such as hard disk seek time. This technique creates cryptographically strong random bits that prevent an adversary from guessing keys, nonces, or other generated values. Authentication All Xbox network traffic is authenticated. The authentication algorithm is a keyed message authentication code based on a one-way hash function. The hash is generated by the sender and included in each Xbox packet. The receiver generates a corresponding hash based on the incoming packet data and compares it with the hash that was sent. If the hashes don t match, the packet has been tampered with and is ignored. The Xbox SNL never propagates invalid packets to the title level. The authentication mechanism inhibits common network cheats, such as packet spoofing, buffer overruns, and other packet tampering. Encryption Broadcast packets are always encrypted. Encryption cannot be disabled for broadcast packets. Packets sent directly from one Xbox to another are encrypted by default. The encryption phase occurs prior to the authentication phase so that the hash is based on the encrypted bits. The encryption method is based on a symmetric encryption cipher. All encryption and decryption is handled automatically by the Xbox SNL. Any packet received by an Xbox that fails the decryption phase is considered invalid and never propagates to the title level. Although encryption and decryption are extremely fast (see the Secure Library Overhead and Performance section that follows), encryption may be turned off on a per-socket, per-message basis to increase performance. The setsockopt() function is used with the SO_ENCRYPT flag to change the encryption level of a socket. // Turn encryption off BOOL bEncrypt = FALSE; INT err = setsockopt( s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ENCRYPT,                       (const char*)&bEncrypt, sizeof(bEncrypt) ); // Use send or sendto to issue unsecured data . . . INT iBytes = send( s, . . . ); // Turn encryption back on bEncrypt = TRUE; err = setsockopt( s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ENCRYPT,                   (const char*)&bEncrypt, sizeof(bEncrypt) ); The encryption setting affects only the logical state of the socket, not the physical state. In this example, even if the message wasn t physically sent before encryption was turned back on, the network stack will remember that the message should be unencrypted and that the next message should be encrypted. To protect your game and your customers, we highly recommend that you always keep default encryption enabled. The only time you should consider disabling encryption is when turning off encryption provides a performance gain that significantly improves gameplay. When encryption is off, your message payloads will be completely evident to any packet sniffer. Once that data is exposed, a hacker may have all the information he needs to cheat in your game. Be aware that the following items must always be encrypted to meet TCRs: XNADDR This structure contains addressing data that would be useful to a hacker, including the Xbox Ethernet MAC address. XNKEY The session key and key ID are usually sent only via a broadcast message, which is always encrypted. However, if they are sent directly, they must be protected with encryption. XNKID Xbox Packet Format Xbox packets conform to RFC 2406 (IP Encapsulating Security Payload; see   HYPERLINK "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2406.html"  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2406.html ), with the addition of a UDP header immediately following the IP header. The general format of the packet is as follows: Description Size (bytes) Authenticated Encrypted IP header UDP header (NAT header) ESP header (security data) Encryption IV (for encrypted packets) True UDP or TCP header Message payload variable Padding ICV authentication data The outer UDP header forces all packets to use exactly one UDP source port no matter how many actual source ports the game uses. This is essential for Xbox packets to communicate through NATs, a key requirement for future Internet games. This also means that every port number in the range 1 through 65535 is available for Xbox games, because that port number is contained in the   UDP/TCP header; there are no reserved ports. The single UDP source port used by the outer header is the Xbox Game Port, 3074, registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Notice that the IP and outer UDP header are neither authenticated nor encrypted. The Xbox assumes that these fields can and will be spoofed. The Xbox uses the information in the authenticated UDP or TCP header only when reading the packet. The Encryption IV is the initialization vector (IV). The IV is random data used during the encryption process to guarantee that even if the same payload is sent more than once, it will always encrypt to different ciphertext. The ICV is the integrity check value, or the authentication hash. The size of the padding depends on the payload size. Two bytes are always required to store padding information. Unencrypted packets must have a payload size evenly divisible by four, so up to three additional bytes may be added as padding. Encrypted packets must have a payload that s divisible by eight, so up to seven additional bytes may be added. To avoid wasted space in your packets, always send a payload that is a multiple of 8 bytes (encrypted) or 4 bytes (unencrypted). The maximum UDP payload size is 1,430 bytes. The maximum TCP payload size for a single unfragmented packet is 1,418 bytes. TCP send buffers larger than 1,418 bytes are split automatically into multiple packets and reassembled automatically by the recipient. Secure Library Overhead and Performance Compared to typical UDP/TCP packets, an Xbox packet includes the additional UDP header (8 bytes), the ESP header (8 bytes), the IV for encrypted packets (8 bytes), and the ICV (12 bytes). Encrypted packets have a padding of 2 to 9 bytes. Unencrypted packets have a padding of 2 to 5 bytes. That means that unencrypted Xbox packets are 30 to 33 bytes larger than their unauthenticated PC cousins. Encrypted Xbox packets are 38 to 45 bytes larger than their unauthenticated and unencrypted PC cousins. Because the Xbox uses a broadband connection, this overhead is less significant than it would be for narrowband. The advantage is that all Xbox communication is secure. The authentication and encryption algorithms were chosen not only for their security but also for their performance characteristics. Sending a 1-KB payload with the Xbox SNL takes approximately 0.00012 seconds. That includes the time to allocate the packet, fill it in, compute normal UDP and IP checksums, encrypt the payload, compute the hash, and transmit the packet. With encryption disabled, sending a 1-KB payload requires one-third of that time (40 microseconds). The time overhead is linear based on packet size. Transmit and receive performance can be roughly computed as: x = payload size in bytes t = (10-8)x + 16-6 = transmission/receive time in seconds For example, sending a 512-byte encrypted payload takes approximately t = (10-8)(512) + 16-6 = 51.2-6 + 16-6  ranging in size from 32 bytes to 1 KB, assuming those payloads are sent 20 times per second. Payload size (bytes) Encrypted and Authenticated Authenticated only 0.04% 0.02% 0.04% 0.03% 0.05% 0.03% 0.08% 0.04% 0.13% 0.05% 1,024 0.23% 0.08% These results show that even when sending 20 KB of encrypted and authenticated data per second, CPU usage is less than a quarter of 1 percent! The results for receiving data are almost exactly the same. Because the performance of the secure library is so good, encryption is enabled by default. Performance can be improved by turning off encryption, but only at the price of less secure data. Note   This data was obtained on a DVT3 Xbox Development Kit running build 3704 (retail) using the XNETS.LIB secure retail version of the Xbox SNL. Although these numbers may vary slightly in the final consumer box, they are close estimates to what can be expected in production. Key Exchange For secure communication to take place between two Xbox consoles, the consoles must agree on the keys used to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate packets. When a title sends the first packet to an IP address obtained by the call to XNetXnAddrToInAddr(), the Xbox network stack detects that no security association is established between the game client and destination Xbox. At this point, the two Xbox consoles transparently and automatically engage in a key exchange transaction. In the examples shown above, this key exchange transaction happens whenever a client sends the  join game  message directly to the game host. Xbox key exchange uses a secure key exchange algorithm that requires significant CPU time. Approximately 13 milliseconds are required to compute keys. Both the host and client perform this computation. This performance characteristic may improve in future versions of the library. In the meantime, be aware of the potential performance impact, particularly for games that support  join in progress. How the Xbox Prevents Common Hacker Attacks The Xbox SNL is designed to prevent many common network cheats and hacker attacks. By handling these attacks within the network stack itself, the Xbox insulates network games from having to individually deal with these issues. It also ensures that network performance is maximized, because bad packets can be detected and ignored at a low level. The following table describes common game cheats and how the Xbox inhibits that cheat. Cheat Xbox Detection/Prevention Packet sniffing All broadcast packets are encrypted. Other packets are encrypted by default, so the packet format is concealed. Only the packet format of unencrypted packets is visible. Keep this in mind if you choose to disable encryption your payload will be visible to sniffers. Packet tampering The true TCP/UDP portion of the Xbox packet and the payload is always authenticated. It is also encrypted by default. Modifications to the packet cause the packet to fail authentication. Invalid packets are ignored by the Xbox SNL. Packet spoofing In a shipping game, an Xbox can send data only to other Xbox consoles and can receive data only from other Xbox consoles. Packets sent from a PC masquerading as an Xbox will be ignored, because a PC does not have the data required to emulate an Xbox. Buffer overruns Generating a buffer overrun requires a hacker to modify a packet so that it contains (or seems to contain) more data than the receiver expects. A modified packet will fail authentication and will be ignored. Replay attacks Xbox packets contain time-stamp values. The time stamp is authenticated, so any changes to the time stamp will cause the packet to fail authentication. If an unchanged packet is re-sent, the destination Xbox will detect that the time stamp is out of range and the packet will be ignored. Denial of service The first line of denial of service defense is the ESP header portion of the Xbox packet. It contains security parameters and sequencing data that are checked before any other items in the packet. A flooder program would have difficulty replicating this data. The ESP can be checked without performing the hash authentication, so it s a very fast check. The second line of defense is the authentication itself. Although a flooding program could force the Xbox to authenticate packets, authentication is so fast that the flooding program would have to have very high throughput to adversely affect a game.

Showcase Xbox games technology. Educate and inform RSPs and consumers. The demo disc will be updated at retail every other month using two different methods: Xbox Field Reps.  The demo disc will be updated and installed by the reps at their serviced store locations.  Direct-to-Store Mailings.  The demo disc will be sent directly to non-serviced and some specific account locations for the RSPs to update. Playable game demos not only give consumers an opportunity to play the game firsthand, but they also work as an invaluable marketing and PR tool. To that end, playable and non-playable demos should be an integral part of any marketing/PR plan. When a playable demo is not available, there is simply no better way to generate hype than through the use of non-playable demos. Screenshots simply can t do a game justice, particularly when it comes to portraying the incredible visual and aural experiences made possible by Xbox. Non-playable demos are a perfect way to showcase levels the playable demos won t cover, build consumer awareness, and stir up some excitement over your upcoming title. It is vitally important that publishers make developers aware of the need for a demo as early in the development process as possible. Publishers should make sure developers understand that a demo disc will ultimately bring better sales figures, and subsequently, more developer royalties. By preparing demos, movies, and so on to coincide with editorial coverage and ad campaigns, you can make a huge impression on gamers and really show them what your game is all about. CREATING A PLAYABLE DEMO  1. PRESENTATION AND USABILITY REQUIREMENTS The Presentation and Usability Requirements define how the demo should unveil, step by step, as well as how the user should interact with it. 1.1  PRESENTATION FLOW CHART The following chart summarizes the flow between the states of the game demo: 1.1.1  LAUNCHING THE INTERACTIVE DEMO DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER TITLE SCREENS This screen should contain the logo of the Developer and/or the Publisher. It s the first thing to be shown. It should stay on the screen for no longer than three seconds. GAME TITLE SCREEN The Game Title Screen is the main menu of the game. If the game demo doesn t feature menus, the Game Title Screen should read  Press START to begin  and  Press BACK to exit.  If the game demo does feature menus (limited or detailed), they should be displayed and should contain an option that can be selected to quit. GAME CONTROL SCREEN  A Game Control Screen is an image of the Xbox Controller with instructions about how to play the game. It should appear when the user starts the demo. This image should clearly read  Press START to continue  and should remain on the screen until the user presses START or A. At that point, the user plays the demo. 1.1.2  IN-GAME MENU While the user is playing the demo, if START is pressed, an In-Game Menu should appear. The following three options should be provided (with any other options that your demo must provide): View Game Controls This option should bring up the Control Screen. Restart Demo This option returns the user to the Game Title Screen. Quit to Demos Menu This option quits the Interactive Demo. 1.1.3  QUITTING THE INTERACTIVE DEMO Publishers may create an ending screen that states when the final game will be available, contains a list of features in the final game, gives hints, and/or displays any other marketing messages to the player that are pertinent to the demo or final game. From this screen, users will be returned to the Official Xbox Magazine Game Disc interface after a period of time no longer than five seconds. 2. TECHNICAL GUIDELINES The technical guidelines for Xbox interactive demos are detailed in the document  Xbox Demo Technical Guidelines,  which is available on the Xbox Developer Support Web site. The major benefit of following these guidelines is that it guarantees that the interactive demo will work equally well in any of a number of situations.  3. CONTENT SUGGESTIONS Suggestions to help in the preparation of the Interactive Demo. 3.1  GENERAL SUGGESTIONS The Interactive Demo should provide approximately 15 minutes of original gameplay. Xbox defines original gameplay as the time it takes to get familiar with the controls and complete the objectives of the demo. The playable demo should feature moderately challenging gameplay. The experience will be more enjoyable if the user doesn t run into problems they can t solve or into situations they can hardly overcome.  The game demo may use more than one game control screen. If this is the case,  the screens should simply be displayed one after the other.  If the game features some cinematic sequences for introduction, they can be presented either before the initial Game Title Screen appears or right after the game demo is launched. It should be possible to interrupt these sequences by pressing either START or A.  3.2  DEMO CONTENT SUGGESTIONS The developer is responsible for the content of the demo. Following are some general questions and ideas to help the developer choose the content of the demo, depending on the genre of the game.  GENERAL What are the features that are unique to your game? How can you emphasize some of these features in a game demo? Is there a gameplay element you should insist on? ROLE PLAYING GAME / STORY DRIVEN GAMES How much of the storyline do you have to reveal to catch the interest of the player? Does it make sense to use cinematic sequences to introduce the context of the game and the character? What do you want the player to accomplish? Is there a simple objective that can be aimed for so that the user gets a glimpse of the combat system, different attacks and spells, and different creatures? RACING GAMES What are the strong points of your racer? Is it how realistic it is? Is it how fast or how arcade-like it is? Is it the splendid environment of the tracks? How can you highlight this and make it stand out from other similar racers? ACTION / FIRST PERSON SHOOTER What actions are unique to your game? Can the character swim, fly, or jump? Does your game feature any innovative weapon or fighting system? What s the best way to let the player experiment with those? SPORTS GAMES How does your game improve on the other sports titles out there? For example, how is your hockey game different from all the other ones? Is it because of its advanced AI or because of its incredible level of realism? FIGHTING GAMES How do combos / special moves / counters work in your game? And how can you show the player how to execute these actions? What original characters should you show in a demo?  What should be the location of the fight? Should it display some exceptional graphical feature of the game engine? CREATING A NON-PLAYABLE DEMO PRESENTATION Non-playable demos are typically 45 second videos used to generate hype before a playable demo can be published. Traditional Hollywood movie trailers are great examples of the style, quality, and overall presentation. Non-playable demos should include a single title screen with the name of the publisher or game, footage of actual gameplay, and footage of intros and/or cut-scenes. Ideally the preview trailer should not only get the viewer excited about the way a game looks and sounds, but also hint at its underlying story or premise.  RECOMMENDED ELEMENTS Title screen (game name, publisher, developer). ESRB rating of the final game (if one does not exist,  Rating Pending  should be displayed). At least 30 seconds of actual in-game play. High production value, similar to Hollywood movie trailers. Rendered intro sequences and cut scenes (to help convey story). Narration is recommended to add impact. Text can be used to help convey features or story elements. LENGTH Ideal running time is approximately 45 seconds. Non-playable demos should not exceed one minute, but exceptions can be made   please contact us in advance if you wish to provide a longer sequence. ENDING A NON-PLAYABLE DEMO Publishers may consider displaying a single ending screen that states when the final game will be available, contains a list of features in the final game, gives hints, and/or displays any other messages to the player pertinent to the game being previewed. From this screen, users should be returned to the interface. This screen should be displayed no longer than five seconds. PLAYABLE DEMO SUBMISSION PROCEDURE PROCESS The first step is to submit your demo to Microsoft for certification. All playable demos must pass through the Xbox certification process before they are approved for publication. This process is very similar to full-game certification and is controlled entirely by Microsoft. It requires filling out a certification form and and delivering your demo to the certification team on appropriate media. Demo certification is done on a first come first served basis and can take anywhere from 7 to 14 days. Please account for this duration in your schedule, as demos that do not make it through certification in time will NOT make the targeted disc. Contact your Xbox Account Manager for schedule details. All playable demos must be certified prior to the noted  CONTENT DELIVERED  scheduled deadline. Please contact your account manager to make arrangements.  All demos must be submitted in full accordance with the requirements set forth in the Xbox Guide. All demos must be submitted with a launcher utility which launches the demo and passes it data in the same manner as described in the technical guidelines. The Xdemos launcher is provided on the Xbox Developer Support Web site for use in testing and submitting demos.  Playable demos can be submitted to: Xbox Certification Group Attention: Debby Engevik 18500 Union Hill Road Redmond, WA  98052 In addition to Microsoft s certification form, you must fill out a Retail Interactive Demo Disc Submission Form, which can be found at the end of this document. Please include a submission form with all playable demos to ensure proper processing.

The Xbox Guide can be found online at   HYPERLINK "http://xds.xbox.com"  http://xds.xbox.com , the Xbox support Web site for publishers and developers. Access to this Web site can be obtained through your account manager. If you do not know how to contact your account manager, please send e-mail to   HYPERLINK "mailto:xbox@xbox.com"  xbox@xbox.com The demos will be certified based on the full game TCR with additional restrictions placed.

This gives you the option of letterbox or standard 4:3 full-screen image size. NTSC (4:3) PAL (for European markets) Accepted submission formats: We strongly recommend that all materials be provided in digital format. DV or MiniDV formats are our first preference; however, Digi-Beta is also an excellent choice. While we do accept Beta-SP tapes, we recommend against this option as it does not always produce the level of quality we are shooting for. Each video trailer submission should contain two tapes: one VHS version for easy viewing and one professional quality version to be published. (See Submission of Materials for submission details.) DV/MiniDV (preferred) and VHS Digi-Beta (preferred) and VHS Beta-SP and VHS SIZE LIMITATIONS  The Xbox Retail Interactive Demo Disc is a DVD-9 (8.54-GB capacity) format DVD. The total amount of space available for demos, trailers, and other extra materials is 6.4 GB. Unless a special arrangement is made, please try to keep preview trailers under one minute in length.

System Requirements: IE5 or better Win2000/SP2 or Win98 (WebDrive will only work with Win2000) IE Configuration: In IE, go to Tools-Internet Options-Security. Click on Custom Level. Enable launching programs and files in an IFRAME. Now go to https://xds.xbox.com (Note the https) Enter your user name and password (CASE SENSITIVE) at this screen. This can be a  copy and paste  from your email. File Transfer Page. Click on  Transfer  on the navigation image and then click on appropriate upload page link on left (Yours will not say PublicDrop) You will then see a window similar to this. You can drag and drop to and from this window. You can also browse within the directory structure, view file properties and cut and paste. Possible problems are the inability to copy htm files (asp, htm, html, xml : all flavors), without first zipping them or renaming them. We don't recommend attempting to copy files larger than 20MB. Larger files (or a large group of individual files) should be spanned across multiple compressed files using a compression utility like Turbozip. This utility will allow you to compress and span a large file (or a large group of individual files) across a set of cab files.  We now have a site license for WebDrive, which allows you to map a local drive to any FTP or WebDAV site (XDS.XBOX.COM is a WebDAV site) if you are using Win2000. Once Webdrive is enabled you will be able to use command line utilities such as copy, xcopy and robocopy to move files up to our site. Robocopy supports Network Restartable, which will allow you to begin and complete your upload unattended. You can download it from us by clicking the WebDrive. See the WebDrive section at the end of this document for details. WebDrive Configuration After installing WebDrive, open the Site Manager and configure a new site. Use the  following settings: The Username and password will be your login information. The drive letter can be set to any letter. Note: You will need to contact your Account Manager for specifics on which Site Address/URL to use. The format will follow https://xds.xbox.com/xdsdirectory/[TITLE] where TITLE is the game title you are working. You can find this URL on the file transfer page under the navigation link for your site.

While the communication protocol remains the same as HID, the complicated descriptor parsing is eliminated. Instead, XID defines various device types and subtypes. From these, the set of reports and report structures are known. Hardware is constrained to using the report formats defined by the Xbox team and must scale their data appropriately. Future expandability is provided for by allowing later versions to append new fields to the existing reports and add additional reports. The host Universal Serial Bus (USB) software is designed to mask future extensions from legacy clients. The device type, subtype, and report lengths are reported in new XID defined VENDOR specific descriptor. Additionally, there is a VENDOR-specific GET_CAPABILITIES command that describes the validity of fields in a report. These additions are VENDOR, rather than CLASS specific, so that the device may continue to function (from a firmware standpoint) on a HID compliant system. Such firmware would simply support both sets of descriptors. A similar strategy will likely be pursued for force feedback devices in the future. New output reports would be added exactly as they are in Physical Interface Device (PID) standards, only the descriptor would not be provided. The Xbox team would publish the structure and format of the reports associated with force feedback devices. The vibration motors do not use this approach because PID is overkill for two motors. A simple vibration output report is defined instead. Goals XID is a proprietary USB class designed as a simplified alternative to the Human Interface Device (HID) class specification for USB devices. The goals of the standard are: A simple standard for Xbox game controllers and other Xbox input controls. Future expandability allowing backward compatibility for both titles and devices (i.e., the common supported features always work). Coexistence with HID so that a single firmware stock keeping unit (SKU) can support both XID and HID. Support for simple device output (vibration motors, LEDs (light emitting diodes). Operational Model Endpoints XID devices normally have three endpoints: the default endpoint, an interrupt-IN endpoint, and an interrupt-OUT endpoint. The interrupt-OUT endpoint is optional (for example, devices that do not receive output from the system vibration motors, LEDs, etc. do not require this endpoint). XID will use the first interrupt-IN and interrupt-OUT endpoints associated with the interface and neglect all others. Input and Output Reports XID uses the same system of input and output as HID. XID input reports are usually transmitted on the interrupt-IN endpoint, and output reports on the interrupt-OUT endpoint. Unlike HID, XID reports must be less than or equal to the maximum packet size (wMaxPacketSize in the endpoint descriptor) of the applicable endpoint. Since the Xbox game system only supports full-speed devices, this is not too onerous. Additionally, all XID reports begin with a one-byte Report ID. Under HID, this is true only if a Report ID item appears in the report descriptor. The standard HID commands GET_REPORT and SET_REPORT (defined later in this document) can be used to transmit reports over the default control endpoint rather than the interrupt endpoints. The packet size of the device must be big enough to contain a complete report. No report may be larger than 64 bytes the largest allowed packet size. Device Types and Subtypes The device type defines the primary use of the device (game controller, DVD remote controller, and so on). If a game supports a device type, it supports all devices of that type. The number of reports, their direction (input or output), and their format (field offsets, sizes, default values, and ranges) are determined by the device type and version. Future versions will never remove reports or alter the size or offset of existing fields or alter their meaning in a way that would make them incompatible with existing titles. The Xbox system software ensures that devices built for future versions appear identical to the version a game was compiled against. The device subtype implies additional information about the device, such as form factor and specific mapping of controls to the report fields. For example, a wheel subtype of the game controller type would indicate the position of the steering wheel in field determined by the subtype. The published mappings are designed so that most games will be able to ignore the subtype. However, a driving game (as an example) would probably want (and for some certifications, would be required) to tune gameplay to the standard controller and a steering wheel independently. These games would use the subtype to choose which mapping and tuning parameters to use. Games will most likely have to use subtype when designing their controller remapping interfaces. Field Scaling and Unused Fields Devices should provide a minimum set of controls to be usable with the intended genre of games. (The standard Xbox Controller is intended to work well with all games.) A device is not required to provide a physical control for every field in every report. Such controls should always report the specified default value. Additionally, devices are expected to scale the reported values to published specifications (see Appendix A).  The following guidelines should be applied when scaling and clipping raw data. For displacement controls, the processed data reported should be an affine transformation from the actual axis displacment.  For pressure sensitive controls, such as proportional buttons, this guideline does not apply. Axes should be clipped at the extremes such that all axis go to full scale in both directions.  Be sure that the extreme values are really full scale and not merely close. Each axis should be processed independently.  For example, a thumb stick with a circular range of motion will report at full scale in the X or Y axis only. Games expect a certain amount of jitter in axis position.  At most only minimal smoothing or filtering of raw data should be done. In keeping with c), firmware should not attempt data processing report the median value of the range in the center position of thumbsticks.  Games will expect as much as +/- 12% in the reported center value.  They will also expect good fine control in the center, so do NOT implement a dead zone in firmware. GET_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES (defined later in this document) is intended to allow the interested title to determine which controls actually exist on the device and to determine their intrinsic resolutions. Not all games are expected to use this information. Compound and Composite Devices The standard Xbox Controller is a compound device. There is an internal hub that has port 1 hard-wired to the controller functionality. The two slots are USB ports, and the expansion devices are USB devices. Xbox system software also supports composite devices. A composite device is defined in the USB Common Class Feature Specification: Logical Devices.  A USB device that provides more than one function to a host by declaration of class codes at the interface level.  XID audio and memory unit devices are all classes defined at the interface level. Xbox software supports composite devices of these three types. Such composite devices will be indistinguishable at the title library level from similar compound devices. The order of the interface should be the same as the slot number in the similar compound device in order to maintain this indistinguishability. Xbox games will not take advantage of composite device features that are added after release of the game.  Polling Interval and Idle Rate The Xbox game system does not, in general, honor the bInterval in the endpoint descriptor of XID devices. It has two polling modes, auto-poll and manual poll. In auto-poll mode, the interval is 8 milliseconds. In manual poll mode, the game issues an IN request directly at its predetermined rate, most often at 16-millisecond intervals, in sync with the video frame. The Xbox game system does not support SET_IDLE as defined in the HID specification; the idle rate is effectively infinity on the Xbox game system. Regardless of polling rate and mode, which are unknown to the device, the device should be prepared to respond to IN requests at random intervals. It should always respond with the latest unreported state. If the state changes multiple times between IN requests, only the last state should be reported. If the state does not change between IN requests, the device should negatively acknowledge (NAK) the IN request, regardless of the time since the previous acknowledge (ACK). For practical reasons, a device may occasionally NAK a request even if the state has changed. Firmware should be designed to minimize this as much as possible. All current game devices are absolute devices (the standard input report contains the absolute state of the device). In the future, it may be desirable to support relative devices, such as mice, or relative controls on game devices. Devices with relative controls will need to coalesce changes between poll requests. Note: In our development program we have encountered problems with numerous chipsets in the area of overwriting data that has already been submitted to transfer.  This may make coalescing data difficult or impossible on some USB function chip implementations. Descriptors This section defines the various descriptors a XID device must support. Gray areas of the tables show standard fields that are not accessed by the Xbox system software. Italics indicate special handling.  Standard Device Descriptor Offset Field Value Description BLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes BDescriptorType Constant DEVICE descriptor type BcdUSB USB version BDeviceClass Class XID is an interface standard BDeviceSubClass SubClass Ignored BProtocol Protocol Ignored bMaxPacketSize0 Number (8, 16, 32, or 64) Maximum packet size for endpoint 0 IdVendor Vendor ID IdProduct Product ID Offset Field Value Description BcdDevice Device release number iManufacturer Index Index of string descriptor describing manufacturer iProduct Index Index of string descriptor describing product iSerialNumber Index Index of string descriptor describing the device s serial number bNumConfigurations Number Number of possible configurations The Xbox game system does not provide any way of accessing the manufacturer, product, or serial number strings. All Xbox XID devices must be defined in the first configuration. Standard Configuration Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant CONFIGURATION Descriptor Type. wTotalLength Number Total length of data returned for this configuration. This includes this descriptor, all the interface descriptors, and their endpoint descriptors. It may also include vendor-specific descriptors.  The Xbox game system constrains this value to be less than 256 bytes. bNumInterfaces Number Number of interfaces associated with the configuration. bConfigurationValue Number Value to use to set this configuration. On the Xbox game system, this must be 1. iConfiguration Index Index of string descriptor describing this configuration. bmAttributes Bitmap Ignored. MaxPower Ignored. The bmAttributes and MaxPower fields both refer to the power behavior of a device. In general, the Xbox game system does not support power features such as suspend mode and remote wakeup. Overall power consumption is regulated by strict limits on power consumption in the hardware specification of Xbox certified devices. The software does not refuse devices based on power consumption. It will handle current overload and overheating conditions. Standard Interface Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes bDescriptorType Constant INTERFACE Descriptor Type bInterfaceNumber Number Number of interface bAlternateSetting Number XID does not use alternate settings bNumEndpoints Index May be one or two, depending on whether the device has outputs bInterfaceClass Class 0x58 (or same as HID, 0x03) 1 bInterfaceSubClass SubClass Ignored bInterfaceProtocol Protocol Ignored iInterface Index Index of string descriptor describing interface  The XID interface class is 0x58.  However, the Xbox Game Console will also support a device that reports the HID class ID of 0x03.  This allows a single firmware SKU to support both XID and HID. While the Xbox System Software currently ignores bInterfaceSubClass, this should be set deliberately.  A value of 0x42 is recommended if 0x58 is used for the bInterfaceClass.  If 0x03 is used for the bInterfaceClass, then 0x00 must be used for the bInterfaceSubClass for compatibility with Windows.  Standard Endpoint Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant ENDPOINT Descriptor Type. bEndpointAddress Number Bit 3..0 Endpoint Number Bit 6..4 Reserved Must Be 0 Bit 7 Direction: 1 = IN, 0=OUT bmAttributes Bitmap 3 = interrupt endpoint. XID has only interrupt endpoints aside from the default endpoint, which does not have a descriptor. wMaxPacketSize Number For XID, the packet size must accommodate the largest report in a single packet. (8, 16, 32, and 64 are allowed values.) bInterval Number Polling interval in milliseconds. See Polling Interval and Idle Rate for details regarding why bInterval is ignored. XID Descriptor Offset Field Value Description bLength Number Size of this descriptor in bytes. bDescriptorType Constant XID descriptor type. bcdXid Number XID version. bType Number The type of device. bSubType Number The subtype of device. bMaxInputReportSize Number Size of the largest input report. bMaxOutputReportSize Number Size of the largest output report. wAlternateProductIds Number Up to four-word alternate Product Ids for the purpose of identifying similar devices from the same manufacturer.  Unused entries should be 0xFFFF. The XID descriptor is obtained by using a VENDOR-defined version of GET_DESCRIPTOR (defined later in this document). The bMaxInputReportSize field is used to determine the required buffer size for reports on the interrupt-IN endpoint. bMaxOutputReportSize is the largest output report the device is expecting. The XID driver will truncate any reports longer than bMaxOutputReportSize, and bLength will be altered to reflect the size of the report the title expects. WAlternateProductIds   This field is currently unused.  There are no criteria at this time for a device to be listed as similar.  All entries should be treated as unused and filled with 0xFFFF. Requests Standard Requests XID devices should support the list of standard requests below. Refer to the USB Specification Revision 1.1 for details. CLEAR FEATURE for ENDPOINT_HALT GET_DESCRIPTOR for all standard descriptors SET_ADDRESS SET_CONFIGURATION HID Class Requests Only GET_REPORT and SET_REPORT from the HID specification need to be supported. SET_REPORT is only necessary for devices with output. In order to reduce the cross referencing, the format of these requests is duplicated here. GET_REPORT bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 10100001B GET_REPORT (0x01) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report wValue: The high byte is the report type (0x01 for input) and the low byte is the report ID. The data returned has the exact format as a report sent over the interrupt-IN endpoint. GET_REPORT may also be used to retrieve reports not normally sent over the interrupt-IN endpoint. The XID device type determines the existence of such reports. Details can be found in the appendixes. If the device does not support the specified report type and report ID, it should STALL the request. All report ID s not currently specified for a particular device type are reserved for future use with that device type.  Test reports should set the VENDOR bit in bmRequestType. SET_REPORT bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 00100001B SET_REPORT (0x09) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report wValue: The high byte is the report type (0x02 for output) and the low byte is the report ID. The data sent has the exact format as a report sent over the interrupt-OUT endpoint. XID devices that report non-zero bMaxOutputReportSize but do not have an interrupt-OUT endpoint will receive output reports with SET_REPORT. Devices that require low-latency output must support the interrupt-OUT endpoint. If the device does not support the specified report type and report ID, it should STALL the request. XID VENDOR Requests These requests are newly defined for XID. They are defined as VENDOR-specific so that they will not interfere with future changes to the HID specification. GET_DESCRIPTOR (for XID_DESCRIPTOR) bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 11000001B GET_DESCRIPTOR 0x4200 Interface Length XID_DESCRIPTOR GET_DESCRIPTOR is the same as the standard GET_DESCRIPTOR, except that bmRequestType indicates VENDOR-defined and that the request is for an interface rather than the whole device. GET_CAPABILITIES bmRequestType bRequest wValue wIndex wLength 11000001B GET_CAPABILITIES (0x01) Report type and report ID Interface Length Report Capabilities GET_CAPABILITIES returns the capabilities of the device with respect to a particular report. If the device does not support the specified Report Type and Report ID, it should STALL the request. If the device supports one or more fields, it should return a packet of the same structure as the report with a bit set for every bit that is functional in the report. This does not include calculated bits. If a field is 8-bits wide and scaled from 0 to 255, but the device only has six-bit resolution, the device should return 11111100B in that field. A device need only return data up to the last bit that would be set. In practice, USB requires whole bytes be returned. Fields after the last data returned are assumed to be unsupported. This is necessary to support future extensions of reports. Devices must support GET_CAPABILITIES for every report supported. Interaction with HID Protocol Without consideration of the proprietary connector, XID devices do not generally work with standard HID-compliant systems. Nothing in this specification should preclude an XID firmware-compliant device from also incorporating support for all of the HID requirements to work on a HID-compliant system. The only minor loss of functionality is that the reports must be scaled in firmware, and a HID-compliant system would not be able to determine their true physical range. Appendix Sections detailing each device will be added as they are further defined.

This value is subject to growth with future versions. Interpretation of Fields All devices must normalize the values they report and should report the full range. Where items in the table represent arrays, the min and max are given for each item in the array. Bits and bytes are stored in little-endian order (least significant bit (LSB) first, most significant bit (MSB) last). bmButtons Layout (lsb) (msb) S: Start Button B: Back Button U: Directional Pad Up D: Directional Pad Down L: Directional Pad Left R: Directional Pad Right LT: Left Thumb Stick Button RT: Right Thumb Stick Button N: Not Used When a button is pressed, the corresponding bit will be 1. When it is released, the corresponding bit will be 0.

Interpretation of Fields The speed is normalized. Devices should respond to the entire range. 0 indicates the motor is off. How wLeftMotorSpeed and wRightMotorSpeed map to the physical motor speeds will be determined later (linear, exponential, other?).

How to run the hardware test harness:

1. Make sure you have launcher listed under section [TestList] in TESTINI.INI
2. Copy TESTINI.INI to C:\TDATA\103be6d2 on test machine
3. Copy HWTEST.XBE to C:\XBOXOS\SYSTEM32\DEFAULT.XBE
4. Reboot Xbox machine and establish telnet session from Windows 2000 machine
5. Under telnet window, type "help" to display help message or type "run" to run test, for example "run memtest" will run memory read/write test

; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory.
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off
; the root of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).
; If there are multiple class names for a single image, use a colon to separate
; each.
;
; All bits that ship in the NT base product and are installed with winnt32,
; must have a class name of retail.
;
; If you add a new file to the list, please refrain from creating your own
; special section.  Doing so makes it difficult to detect duplicates.  If
; you're unable to add your image due to a collision with an existing name,
; work it out with the other developer.  Options include creating another
; placefil.txt for your project or using the ALT_PROJECT_TARGET macro in your
; sources file to change the base of the distribution point (doing so means
; your project will not install as part of base NT).
;
;     sort /+17 < placefil.txt > placefil.srt
;
; will generate a list sorted by class name if you want.
;
; IMPORTANT NOTE:
;
; If you add a file to the system, YOU MUST make sure layout.inf is updated
; before you start depending on it or else you will cause a BVT break. Do
; not attempt to modify layout.inf yourself, but follow instructions on:

Direct3D IM Translucent Palettized Texture Stress Test -- alphpal2.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    alphpal2

Description:

    This test stresses the creation and rendering of translucent 
    palettized textures.  It begins by creating six 8 bpp textures
    and ninety-six 4 bpp textures, each of which has a 50% chance
    of being created as a mipmap.  These textures are then rendered
    in various permutations every frame.  The way the textures are
    drawn can be broken into three categories, randomly chosen from
    at the beginning of a frame: homogenous palettes, heterogeneous 
    palettes, and recurring palettes.  When homogeneous palettes are
    selected, only 4 bpp or 8 bpp textures will be rendered in the
    frame.  Either four 8bpp textures are chosen from the pool of six,
    or sixty-four textures are chosen from the pool of ninety-six
    (for a total of 1024 unique palette entries used in the frame, the
    maximum supported by the hardware).  When heterogeneous palettes
    are selected, both 4 bpp and 8 bpp textures are rendered in the 
    frame.  The depth of the textures used alternates in a somewhat
    random order, but still does not exceed the palette entry limit
    in the hardware.  When recurring palettes are selected, both
    4 bpp and 8 bpp textures are rendered, but unlike hetergeneous
    palettes, individual textures are rendered multiple times in the 
    frame.  Whichever category appears in a frame, the textures that
    are drawn have two identifying numbers to verify they have been
    correctly rendered.  The larger number in the lower half of each
    texture is simply a 4 or an 8, corresponding to the bit depth of
    the texture.  The smaller number at the top of the texture is
    a number identifying its location within the texture pool.  When
    looking at the textures from left to right and top to bottom, these
    numbers should increase by one sequentially from a base number
    within a string of textures of the same depth.

    In addition to the variety of rendering combinations, each texture 
    is assigned a decay rate (measured in frames).  When a texture 
    decays, it is released and a new texture or mipmap is created in 
    its stead.

    When rendered on the screen, each texture is drawn on a quad.
    The quads are arranged in a grid of rows and columns.  They should
    appear translucent on the screen in front of a background texture
    that has been rendered opaque.  The alpha information for the
    translucency is stored in the palette entries of the textures.

Detailed Description: The test verifies vertex blending transformations with different number of transformation matrices (from 2 to 4) by rendering a sphere with non-linear distribution of blending coefficients across its Y axis. At any given time only 2 matrices are used. Other matrices are set to identity (second matrix in 1, 3 case) or undefined (fours matrix in 1,3 case). During the loop test also goes across three different scenarios: (1) geometry only, (2) texture with texture coordinates, (3) texture with texture generation.

Usage:

    fvertex1

Description:

    This application tests the rendering of geometry composed of
    vertices defined by a number of different flexible vertex 
    formats.  In each case the vertices define a teapot, but they
    vary in terms of the transformation state of their coordinates,
    their lighting information, and the number of their texture 
    coordinates.  In general, the top row of teapots on
    the screen corresponds to untransformed, unlit vertices.  The
    middle row corresponds to untransformed, pre-lit vertices.
    The bottom row is made up of transformed, pre-lit vertices.

    state    A state identifier specifying the initial state to render

Description:

    This test stresses the run-time generated, dynamic code of
    the inner rendering loop of DDHAL.  It cycles through all
    permutations of the following render states and draws spheres to
    the screen for each of them using different primitive and vertex 
    types: fill mode, front-clipping, texturing (untextured, textured, 
    multitextured, or bump mapped), wrapping (no wrapping or wrap u 
    and v), lighting (no lighting, single directional lighting, or 
    complex lighting with directional, point, spot, and parallel point 
    lights), vertex fog, and specular.

    For each frame rendered using the states above, 36 spheres are
    drawn to the screen using different primitive types, vertex types,
    and index types.  The spheres are arranged on the screen as
    follows:

                 |--------Untransformed-------|    |-Transformed-|

Direct3D IM Multitexture Test -- mstage2.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    mstage2

Description:

    This is a test of multitexturing using both color and alpha
    operations in four stages.  The test renders three spheres:
    the one to the left is textured with a 4444 surface containing
    alpha information and modulating the alpha in each stage;
    the center sphere is textured using surfaces of different
    formats with all alpha information set to opaque, but takes 
    translucent alpha values from a material modulated in during
    the first stage; the sphere to the right modulates colors 
    in the stages, but disables alpha operations and appears opaque.

    The vertices defining the spheres contain four texture
    coordinate pairs.  While rendering, one pair is offset in the +v
    direction, another in the -v direction, a third in the +u
    direction, and the last in the -u direction.  This has the 
    effect of scrolling each of the four textures in different
    directions.  On the spheres, each of the different colored
    arrows should be moving in a different direction from the
    rest.  But the texture of each of the arrows should be moving
    in the same direction that its arrows are facing.

Direct3D IM Multitexture Mipmapping Test -- mstage5.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    mstage5

Description:

    This is a test of multitexturing in four stages using mipmaps
    whose filter modes differ from stage to stage.  The test renders
    eight quads, each drawn using four texture stages.  The mipmap
    in a given stage is a mostly white surface with a strip 1/4 the
    width of the mipmap containing a brick image with yellow number
    on it indicating the level of the mipmap.  The brick strip runs
    the height of the mipmap and is placed on the far left of the
    mipmap if it is used in stage 0, 1/4 the way in to the mipmap if
    it is used in stage 1, 1/2 the way in to the mipmap if it is
    used in stage 2, and 3/4 to way in to the mipmap (on the far right)
    if it is used in stage 3.  When the colors of all mipmaps are
    modulated together they will produce a solid brick background
    for the quad with four numbers on it indicating the mipmap levels
    used in each of the stages.

    The four quads in the top row are all opaque mipmaps and the four
    quads on the bottom are translucent mipmaps with their translucent
    alpha values coming from a material and modulated with opaque
    texture values in the alpha cascade (different formats are
    used for each of the mipmaps).  The quads in the first column are
    rendered with the filtering set to none for all texture stages.
    The quads in the second column are rendered using a point
    filter in all stages.  The quads in the third column are rendered
    using a linear filter in the first and last stage and a point
    filter in the middle stages.  The quads in the last column are
    rendered with filtering set to none in the first and last
    texture stages (and the fourth texture in the cascade switched
    from a mipmap to a regular texture) and with filtering set to
    point in the middle stages.

Graphics memory integrity test -- vigil.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    vigil

Description:

    This test allocates nearly all available memory (from the lower
    64M on 128M development kits) and uses it for resources in the
    form of vertex buffers, textures, and index lists.  All
    allocated resources are read by the GPU every frame to build an
    image in the frame buffer.  The frame buffer (color and alpha)
    and depth buffer (z and stencil) are written to every frame by
    the GPU.  The CPU reads from all resource memory as well as
    front, back, and depth buffers every frame and verfies the
    memory contents have not changed since the time of initialization.

Environment variable options:

    VIGILVERBOSE            - Output detailed debugging information.

    VIGILNORESOURCECHECK    - Only verify the frame buffers and
                              depth buffer each frame.  Errors in
                              the textures, vertex buffers, and
                              index lists will still likely propagate 
                              to the frame buffer and cause errors to
                              be reported, but the specific resources
                              with corrupt memory will not be 
                              identified until an error first appears
                              in the frame buffer.  Compiling with
                              this option will significantly boost
                              the frame rate.

    VIGILNOTEXTUREWRITES    - Do not perform GPU writes to all created
                              textures every frame.  If this option is
                              not defined, the system will perform a GPU
                              copy of the memory from all textures into
                              a temporary buffer, a CPU clear of the
                              textures, and another GPU copy of the
                              memory from the temporary buffer back
                              into the textures to restore them.

    VIGILGENERATECRCS       - Generate the CRC file used to verify
                              the frame buffer, depth buffer, and
                              resources.

Direct3D IM Texture Wrapping Test -- wrap1.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    wrap1

Description:

    This test verifies wrapping in the u and v directions for a 
    texture.  When running correctly a quad should appear in the
    center of the screen displaying a small red rectangle in its
    upper left, purple rectangles to the right and bottom of it, 
    and a larger blue square in the bottom right.

User Input:

    Keyboard        Gamepad         Action

For what releases? What level of parameter checking will be present?  Will all error conditions cause an ASSERT? Differences Between Xbox and Desktop Implementations Supported API Currently, the DirectPlay8 interfaces are only documented in Beta versions of the DirectX 8 SDK.  From looking at the information there, I ve come up with the following basic list of API s.  The DirectVoice API s are made up of 3 interfaces   IdirectPlayVoiceClient, IdirectPlayVoiceServer and IDirectPlayVoiceTest.  These interfaces have been left out of this test plan pending an Xbox spec.

This harness allows for complex network events, such as hosts leaving and being disconnected from a session, to be scripted.  Much of the early effort for testing DirectPlay for Xbox has come via porting the TestNet harness and running the existing tests on the Xbox client.  Now that it has been decided that the Xbox version of DPlay will uses a polling model and Xbox will not support DLLs, it will be difficult to port the TestNet harness in its entirety.  Instead, the only modules that make up the DPlay8 TestNet tests will be ported (as much as is directly applicable to Xbox) and Netsync will be used as the synchronizing agent for tests, which require coordination between multiple machines.  If, at a later date, there is enough time available to look at porting the entire TestNet harness to Xbox, then it will be considered. To install the DirectPlay team s TestNet tools, run this batch file.

The quality bar is set below that of a beta product but should still be basically usable by developers.  Memory leaks and stress scenarios aren t as important as the basic ability to be able to set up communication sessions and exchange data.  Peer interfaces will be targeted above client and server cases.  For this release, the DirectX 8 SDK will be taken as the spec reference.  In later releases, when DirectPlay for Xbox changes from a callback model to a polling model, this dependence on the DirectX 8 SDK will be relaxed somewhat. DirectVoice will be tested to the extent that it integrates with DirectPlay.  DanRose will test all audio specific portions of DirectVoice. All IDirectPlay8Peer, IDirectPlay8Address and IDirectPlay8AddressIP functions must pass BVT and API level tests.  Some testing may be done on client and server interfaces, but these won t be a requirement for Alpha 2.  For Alpha 2, the majority of the API level testing will be done on a local machine without communicating via the network.    These tests are listed under the BVT/API Testing section. Must pass all network state tests such as host migration, connection/disconnection and enumeration.  These tests are listed under the Network State Testing section. Must pass thirty minutes of basic send/receive/group-management stress on the IDirectPlay8Peer interfaces in a session with 4 players.  This stress test will either be a ported version of DNSalvo, or a simple Xbox app that does something similar.  More information on these tests will be added to the Stress Testing section. Unless mentioned otherwise in the Xbox DirectPlay spec, all DirectPlay functions in the DirectX 8 SDK must at least have basic functionality.  Bugs will be RAIDed against anything that doesn t match these two sources.  These bugs must be resolved either by updating the Xbox DirectPlay spec, or fixing the function that has the problem. Must be able to setup and run a DirectVoice session over DirectPlay for 5 minutes.  More details on this Test Methodology Overview The initial goal of DirectPlay for Xbox testing will be to leverage tests from the DirectPlay team by porting them to the Xbox environment as quickly as possible.  Because the DirectPlay team s TestNet harness has dependencies on many things that are not present on Xbox (i.e. DLLs, callback model, local file system, registry, etc.) this will not be directly ported to Xbox at this time.  Instead, Netsync for Xbox will be used as a synchronizing agent for DirectPlay tests.  Many of these tests will be ported from TestNet test modules.   Several DirectPlay stress tests will also be ported.  Once porting is done and these tests can be run, any holes will be filled by creating Xbox-specific tests. BVT/API Testing Goal: Cover every DirectPlay8 API that will be supported by Xbox and call it with A case for each category of success (e.g. asynchronous, secure, etc.) A case for each error code

call as many DirectPlay API s in as many states and with as many parameters as possible over time. Network State Testing Goal:  Create special test cases for issues that are dependent on network state (e.g. host migration due to timeout).  These test cases come from the DirectPlay Core Test Plan and will be dependent on the TestNet test harness being ported to Xbox.

This style gives the system a uniform appearance that allows group members to read, modify, and maintain each other's modules without learning several different coding conventions. The following items are standardized: Module headers Function headers and declarations Header file format  Names of variables, data types, structure fields, macros, and constants Control structure indentation and placement of braces Module Headers The following prototype should appear at the beginning of each module.  The source to the prototype can be found in file \nt\bak\inc\modhdr.c.

Revision History:     22-Feb-1989     markl         Modified module to conform to the new naming and coding         standards agreed to 21-Feb-1989.     20-Feb-1989     markl         Added module and function headers. Note that the revision history portion is not completed. Until we get further along in the project, we will not keep a revision history. The /*++ <text> --*/ construct is used by a comment extractor program that will be developed to assist in our documentation efforts. Function Headers The following is a prototype function declaration.  This declaration is to appear with the implementation of the function.  The source to the prototype can be found in file \nt\bak\inc\prochdr.c. Notice the following details in the function declaration: A form-feed character should appear one line before the    "return-type" line.  This convention is noted in this document with the  string "<form-feed>". All formal arguments are preceded by one of the following macro definitions:  Indicates that the argument is a non-modifiable input value (i.e., call-by-value semantics) Indicates that the argument is an address which refers to a variable or structure that will be modified by the function (i.e., call-by-reference semantics) IN OUT Indicates that the argument is the address of an input variable or structure that is both read and written by the function (i.e., call-by-reference semantics) The OPTIONAL macro appears after a formal argument of type pointer, HANDLE, or ULONG when the function accepts either a NULL or non-NULL value.  To determine whether the actual value supplied is NULL or non-NULL, the programmer must use the macro ARGUMENT_PRESENT, which takes the pointer, HANDLE, or ULONG variable as an argument and returns a value of type BOOLEAN. The order of the arguments in the comment block is the same as the order in which they appear in the function declaration. The function declaration follows: <form-feed> return-type function-name(     direction type-name argument-name,     direction type-name argument-name...     ) Routine Description:     description-of-function Arguments:     argument-name - [Supplies | Returns]  description-of-argument     .     .     . Return Value:     return-value - description-of-return-value     None         .     .     . The following is a sample of a completed function declaration: <form-feed> IoBuildPartialMdl(     IN PMDL SourceMdl,     IN PMDL TargetMdl,     IN PVOID VirtualAddress,     IN ULONG Length OPTIONAL     ) Routine Description: This routine maps a portion of a buffer as described by an MDL.  The portion of the buffer to be mapped is specified via a virtual address and an optional length.  If the length is not supplied, then the remainder of the buffer is mapped. Arguments:     SourceMdl - MDL for the current buffer.     TargetMdl - MDL to map the specified portion of the buffer.     VirtualAddress - Base of the buffer to begin mapping.     Length - Optional length of buffer to be mapped;  if zero,  remainder. Return value:     None. When a function is declared externally in a header file, its declaration contains only the function prototype and not the comment section. For example: IoBuildPartialMdl(     IN PMDL SourceMdl,     IN PMDL TargetMdl,     IN PVOID VirtualAddress,     IN ULONG Length OPTIONAL     ); Header Files The following sections define the requirements for inclusion and format of header files. Header File Inclusion There are three types of header files in the NT OS/2 system:   Header files that are private to a single operating system component (the kernel or the I/O system, for example) A header file that is shared by the internal components of the operating system (the kernel and the executive) A public header file that defines external application programming interfaces (APIs) for system components outside the kernel and executive Each component of the operating system has a private header file.  The naming convention for these header files is <component-name>p.h.  For example, the private header file for kernel component, ke, is called kep.h. The NT OS/2 shared header file, \nt\private\src\ntos\inc\ntos.h, is included by each component of the executive and by the kernel, using the following statement: #include "ntos.h" (This file is included by a component's private include file.) File ntos.h contains a list of #include statements, one for each operating system component. Each operating system component has a corresponding header file that defines prototypes for the functions that are shared with other components within the executive.  The naming convention for these header files is <component-name>.h. For example, the header file containing shared prototypes for kernel component, ke, is called ke.h. The public header file, \nt\sdk\inc\ntos2.h, is included by all components outside the NT OS/2 kernel and executive, using the following statement: #include <ntos2.h> Header File Format Modules should be able to nest header files without causing multiple definition problems.  To accomplish this, each header file should be conditionally expanded to itself, or to nothing if it has already been expanded. In the example below, if the module pool.h was not previously included, then the macro _POOL_ is defined and the header file is expanded.  Otherwise, _POOL_ is already defined and the remainder of the header file is ignored.  This results in the header file being included only once. The following header file style should be used: Copyright (c) 1989  Microsoft Corporation Module Name:     pool.h Abstract:     This module defines the NT OS/2 pool data structures and     function prototypes. Author:     Mark Lucovsky (markl) 16-Feb-1989 Revision History: #ifndef _POOL_ #define _POOL_ #include "ntdef.h" #include "list.h" #include "process.h" typedef enum _POOL_TYPE {     NonPagedPool,     PagedPool     } POOL_TYPE; #endif // _POOL_ Note that if module list.h were shown, the conditional would appear as follows:    #ifndef _LIST_    #define _LIST_    //    // body    //    #endif // _LIST_ Naming The following sections describe the naming conventions for variables, structure fields, types, constants, and macros. Variable Names Variable names are either in "initial caps" format, or they are unstructured.  The following two sections describe when each is appropriate. Note that the NT OS/2 system does not use the Hungarian naming convention used in some of the other Microsoft products. Initial Caps Format All global variables and formal argument names must use the initial caps format.  The following rules define this format: Words within a name are spelled out; abbreviations are discouraged. The first character of each word in a name is capitalized.  Acronyms are treated as words, that is, only the first character of the acronym is capitalized. The following list shows some sample names that conform to these rules: NumberOfBytes  TcbAddress BilledProcess Unstructured Format Local variables may appear in either the initial caps format, or in a format of the programmer's preference.  The following list shows some possibilities for local variable names: loopindex LoopIndex loop_index Data Type Names A set of primitive data types for use in the NT OS/2 system is defined in the file \nt\sdk\inc\ntdef.h.  All NT OS/2 software  must declare variables using these defined types rather than standard C types, where appropriate.  The following are some examples of NT OS/2 types: PVOID UQUAD STRING All new type names should be created in uppercase using typedef.  Words within the name may either be packed together or separated by underscores.  All types should have a corresponding typedef which defines a pointer to the type.  The name for the pointer is the type name with a "P" prefix. The following example illustrates how to use typedef to create a structure type: typedef struct _POOL_LIST_HEAD {     ULONG CurrentFreeLength;     ULONG TotalEverAllocated;     LIST_ENTRY ListHead; } POOL_LIST_HEAD, *PPOOL_LIST_HEAD; The following example illustrates how to use typedef to create an enumerated type: typedef enum _POOL_TYPE {     NonPagedPool,     PagedPool,     MaxPoolType     } POOL_TYPE; Structure Field Names and Enumeration Constants Structure field names should follow initial caps format.  They should not have field name prefixes tied to a type.  The following is a sample structure: typedef struct _POOL_LIST_HEAD {     ULONG CurrentFreeLength;     ULONG TotalEverAllocated;     LIST_ENTRY ListHead; } POOL_LIST_HEAD, *PPOOL_LIST_HEAD; As illustrated in the previous section, enumeration constants should also follow initial caps format.  Macro and Constant Names All macros and manifest constants should have uppercase names.  Words within a name may either be packed together, or separated by underscores. The following statements illustrate some macro and manifest constant names: #define PAGE_SIZE   4096 #define CONTAINING_RECORD(address, type, field) \         ((type *)((LONG)(address) - \                   (LONG)(&((type *)0)->field))) Note:  Any macro that is likely to be replaced by a function at a later time should use the naming conventions for functions. Indentation and Placement of Braces The following skeletal statements illustrate the proper indentation and placement of braces for C control structures.  In all cases, indentations consist of four spaces each. All control structures should routinely use braces even if there is only a single statement that will be executed. <form-feed> FooBar(     INT ArgumentOne,     PULONG ArgumentTwo     ) Routine Description:     This is the routine description. Arguments:     ArgumentOne - Supplies the value for argument 1.     ArgumentTwo - Supplies the address of argument 2. Return Value:     0 - Success     1 - Failure     //     // Local variables are indented one tab (tabs are 4 spaces)     //     ULONG LocalVariable1;     LONG Counter;     //     // for loops     //    - all for loops must have braces     //    - closing brace is at same indentation level as     //      for statement     //     for ( Counter = 0; Counter < 10; Counter++ ) {         //         // Body of loop         //     }     //     // if statement     //     //    - All if statements should use braces     //     if ( Counter == 0 ) {         //         // Then statements         //     }     //     // if then else     //     if ( Counter == 1 ) {         //         // Then statements         //     } else {         //         // Else statements         //     }     //     // switch statement     //     switch ( Counter ) {     case 1 :         //         // case 1 statements         //         break;     case 2 :         //         // case 2 statements         //         break;     default :         //         // default case         //         break;     } Constructs to Avoid NT OS/2 is written in portable, ANSI C. Due to differences in C compilers, there are a number of coding constructs that need to be avoided in order to promote portability. Left Hand Side Typecasts Some C compilers allow the cast operator on the left hand side of an assignment. This is not allowed by standard C and must be avoided in NT OS/2. Zero Length Arrays in Structures Zero length arrays embedded in structure definitions are not handled uniformly by all C compilers. They should not be used in NT OS/2.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Compliance and Compatibility Test Process Title _PID_HLINKSCompliance and Compatibility Test Process MarkMc Normal.dot MarkMc Microsoft Word 9.0Compliance and Compatibility Test Process Created by: Mark McNulty Compliance and Compatibility Test Lead Date Created: 6/20/01 Highlights: Deliverables to ISVs: In order to help prepare ISVs for Certification, we are providing them with means to test the TCR Compliance of their own game.  Included with the future releases of the XDK will be: A complete list of all test cases to be run by the Xbox Compliance team A set of Certification tools, added to the XDK Launcher.  The tools will handle things from fragmenting the Hard Drive to corrupting saved games. The tools will allow ISVs to have a better sense of comfort while awaiting the results of their game through the Certification process. Compliance and Compatibility will be housed in to labs One dedicated to Final Compliance Passes Lab consists of 6 Test Stations: Storage Audio/Video Networking System User Interaction Stress Wall One dedicated to Compatibility and Pre-Certification Lab consists of 5 Test Stations: 3 Compatibility 2 Pre-Certification  Team Structure: Compliance and Compatibility Test Lead: Mark McNulty (FTE Test Lead) Final Compliance Lab Supervisor: Robert Rodrigues (FTE STE) Final Compliance Lab Support and Test Process support: TBH (FTE STE) Compatibility and Pre-Certification Lab Supervisor: TBH (FTE STE) Final Compliance Lab Test Team: 12 CSG TBH (STE 1) Compatibility and Pre-Certification Lab Test Team: 5 CSG TBH (STE 1) Max Game Throughput per lab: Final Compliance Lab: 2 Games per day 4 to 5 hours per game (12 Testers per game) Per Day is based upon 8 to 10 hours depending on size and type of game Compatibility and Pre-Certification Lab:  Compatibility: 3 Games per day 8 hours spent per game (1 Tester per game) Pre-Certification: 2 Games per day   4 hours per game (2 Testers per game) Pre-Certification Pass: The testing goal behind the pre-certification pass is the following:  The Compliance team will run all tests that the ISV has not been given the means to run (majority are system level hardware access tests) and to observe the game for any potential problem areas that may cause the game to fail during final certification. All contact between Compliance/Compatibility test and the Cert Coordinator or Account Managers will be handled through the Compliance Test Lead.  This will help to minimize confusion and present one story to all involved who need information regarding Xbox games going through the Certification process. Compliance and Compatibility Test Process: Final Certification: Game Files distribution from Certification Burn Lab: Once the tapes are received from the publishers, the Certification burn lab will prepare the RAW data dumps and FST image files (DVD emulator files) for use by all parts of Certification. The Certification burn lab will also create directories on their server with all of the submission media (saved games, covers, documentation, etc..) handed in by the publishers on CD. The bits will be given to the Compliance and Compatibility team one of two ways: The Certification Build lab server will auto pushes the bits to the Compliance Lab server.  Along with all required submission materials. The Compliance lab server has an automatic pull script that will grab all data for the current day. Once bits are received for a given game, the Compliance Lead will update the tracking materials on the internal server.  These are comprised of: Certification Tactics DB This is a Tracking Database used to log the certification process for a given title.  Marketing, Operations and Account Managers will use this as the overall tracking mechanism for Xbox games from proposal till it is sitting on store shelves.  Compliance will log that all test cases for the TCRs pass or fail Game Eval will enter their feedback or tracking issues for games Functional Test will enter any game related bugs as well as verify some TCR requirements When the games are received for the day, the XMIDs and release dates will be entered into the Database Certification Web Page  HYPERLINK "http://complianceX"  http://complianceX  will be the home of the Certification tracking system.  Any authorized user Tactics can visit this web page and find out the current status of a given game through certification.  Various reports and tracking statistics will be made available Compliance Lab Spreadsheet Overall history of Xbox Games that go through the compliance lab will be documented in a tracking Excel Spreadsheet.  This will be made available on the website if needed (This will also be archived daily) Internally this will be used as a quick means for the Compliance Lead to track a game through all phases of Compliance and prepare to send the final report once the game has completed. Once the data is on the Compliance lab server: The FST Images will be transferred to the Game Stress Wall to begin the 72-hour Stress pass. The Stress wall is comprised of: 12 TVs 12 XDK Consoles 12 PCs Each game will be moved to one TV where it will run for 72 hours, in the Attract/Initial Start screen loop. Xbox PerfMon will be used to track performance measurements over the 72 hours The FST Image will then be transferred to all TCR test stations, to prepare them for the days test pass There will be five main test stations: Storage All Hard Disk and Memory Unit read/write TCRs will be verified 3 Testers at station (CSG STE 1) System All system level game interaction TCRs will be verified 2 Testers at station (CSG STE 1) Audio and Video All Video (NTSC, HDTV, etc.) and Audio (Analog, Dolby, Digital, DTS, etc.) related TCRs will be verified 2 Testers at station (CSG STE 1) Networking All online and system link game play TCRs will be verified 1 Tester at station (CSG STE 1) User Interaction All peripheral, game disc, error message and UI TCRs will be verified 4 Testers at station (CSG STE 1) Once at the stations, the Compliance Lab Test Team will begin to verify the game against the Xbox TCRs. All testers will execute pre-made test cases from the Compliance Tactics DB  (  HYPERLINK "http://complianceX"  http://complianceX At all times there will be at least one if not two full time STEs in the lab to ensure that all tests are being run and to offer support to our CSG staff. All tests will be logged as a pass or fail (or N/A) against the requirements set forth by the Xbox TCRs. If a failure is found, one of the FTE Tester on site will verify the failure is valid, mark the test case as a fail and inform the Compliance Lab Lead of the issue. The Compliance Lab Lead will then verify the severity of the failure.  Using the TCR Priority guide, the Compliance Lead will make a determination of the severity of the failure. Once the severity is determined: If the TCR failure is a Priority One failure, mail will be sent to the Certification Coordinator immediately, detailing the failure. Else, the TCR failure will be documented and future failures of the same type will be tracked.  If a pattern if formed surrounding the failure, the Certification Coordinator will be mailed with detailed information regarding the failure and it s spread through the title As Compliance areas are finished, the testers assigned to the area will sign off on the Compliance Sign-Off sheet.  The Compliance Sign-Off sheet will be a web based internal lab tracking tool.  Each XMID will be tracked to ensure all areas are tested and signed off. Once an area (test station) is finished, the FTE lab support will also sign off to signify completion. When the current game is signed off on from an area, they will immediately move on to the next game for the day. If no other game is available, the testers will be assigned other areas to test in order to help out those stations that have yet to complete their pass. ***Throughout the day, the tracking website will be updated with a title s progress through all areas of Certification The updates will be derived from reports generated from Tactics as well as data pulled directly from the Database itself. *** Upon a completed pass for a game, the Compliance Test Lead will generate a final summary report This document will detail the entire Final Certification pass.  It will detail all TCR failures and their cause.  The report will list all information in a consistent and very clear manner as to minimize any confusion. The report will be sent to the Certification Coordinator and the appropriate Account Manager (This is still pending) as soon as possible, once a game has finished it s complete Compliance pass. Complete Compliance pass includes: Generally this will be a 6 day process Final Cert station pass 72 hour Stress pass Compatibility Pass TCR validation being done in conjunction with Functional Test It is not possible for the Compliance lab to verify all TCRs throughout the entire game.  It is not the charter of the Compliance lab to play through the complete game.  Due to this, certain TCRs will be assigned to Functional Test to have them verify over the course of a complete play through of a game.  Certain TCRs will be given a conditional pass and will await a full pass status after functional has signed off that they have indeed passed. Other issues of note: Compliance Server will be backed up daily.  Currently the exact scheme for this is still under discussion. FTE Testers will be responsible for Server upkeep and maintenance and creation of Certification Tools and process. Over initial launch cycle, process will be streamlined and optimized.  After initial wave of games, an automation review will take place.  Any new opportunities for automation will be exploited to the fullest to maximize lab efficiency and to alleviate any unnecessary burden upon personnel. Pre-Certification: Once the data is on the Compliance lab server for Pre-Certification submissions: The FST Image will be transferred to all Pre-Certification stations in the Compatibility Lab Once at the stations, the Pre-Certification testers will begin to verify the game against the Xbox TCRs. All testers will execute pre-made test cases from the Compliance Tactics DB  (  HYPERLINK "http://complianceX"  http://complianceX There will be an FTE tester acting as a lab supervisor to handle any issues that arise with the Pre-Certification process or testers. All tests will be logged as a pass or fail (or N/A) against the requirements set forth by the Xbox TCRs. During the Pre-Certification pass, the testers will also use the  Common Failure Areas  document and keep track of any issues that meet the criteria set forth in this document.  Upon completion of the Test pass, any notes regarding areas from this document will be passed into the Compatibility Lab supervisor. Common Failure Areas  document will be a growing list of the most common failures in Final Certification.  The tester will use this information as a guide for looking at the game through Pre-Certification.  The tester will look for potential areas that could cause failures in Final Certification.   Once a Pre-Certification pass is finished:  The Pre-Certification testers will sign off on the Compliance Sign-Off sheet.  The FTE Lab Supervisor will review the  Common Failure Areas  feedback and sync it to actual TCRs and review the Tactics data for TCR failures A Pre-Certification form will be filled out by the FTE and sent to the Compliance lead Once the Pre-Certification is done and form sent to Compliance lead, the FTE Tester will also sign off to signify completion. When the current game is signed off on, the Pre-Certification testers will immediately move on to the next game for the day. If no other game is available, the testers will be assigned to help out the Final Compliance team stations that have yet to complete their pass. Upon a completed pass for a game, the Compliance Test Lead will generate a final summary report This document will detail the entire Pre-Certification pass.  It will detail all TCR failures and their cause. Also any potential areas that may cause failures at final certification. The report will list all information in a consistent and very clear manner as to minimize any confusion. The report will be sent to the Certification Coordinator and the appropriate Account Manager (This is still pending) as soon as possible, once a game has finished it s complete Compliance pass. Other issues of note: Over initial launch cycle, process will be streamlined and optimized.  After initial wave of games, an automation review will take place.  Any new opportunities for automation will be exploited to the fullest to maximize lab efficiency and to alleviate any unnecessary burden upon personnel. Compatibility: Compatibility testing will begin when the game arrives back on official green discs.   Green discs are expected 6 days after original game DLT tapes are received. Once Green Discs are received: 30 Copies will go to the Compatibility lab 10 copies will go to each Compatibility tester 8 copies for use in each Hardware revision for running 24 hour stress pass 2 Copies for Compatibility Test Pass (All disc and machine numbers will change as more hardware revisions are made) The following details what a Compatibility tester will do: Each Tester will have 16 Xbox Consoles (2 full sets of Hardware) 8 of the consoles will be setup to run a 24-hour Stress pass, each running a copy of the game on Green Disc. The other 8 consoles will be used to run a 8 hour Compatibility test, one hour per hardware revision The Compatibility tests will cover basic game functionality, performance and stability.  All core tests are designed to hit all major areas of the hardware to ensure game/hardware synchronicity (ex. Save/Load games, watch Cinematics, etc.)  All test cases will be logged in Tactics. The Compatibility lab is staffed for 3 testers to cover up to 3 games per day.  If less games come in to test for compatibility the following will be done: 2 Games: 2 Testers will spend 8 hours on one game running through Tactics cases.  The third tester will select 2 of the hardware revisions and spend 4 hours per revision playing the 2 games. The tester will try to visit each level (will vary per game) and play a ways through the level.  This will provide a more in depth coverage over some of the hardware revisions. 1 Game: 1 tester will run through the 8 hour Tactics test pass.  The other two testers will select 2 hardware revisions each and spend 4 hours per revision playing the game.   The tester will try to visit each level (will vary per game) and play a ways through the level.  This will provide a more in depth coverage over some of the hardware revisions. No Game: All testers will re-assigned to work with the Pre-Certification or Final Certification test teams based on the current days needs and schedule. Any compatibility failures will be immediately brought to the attention of the Compatibility Supervisor, who will verify through a repro that the bug does exist and then report it to the Compliance Test Lead The Compatibility lead will review the data and send the necessary info to the Certification Coordinator. Once a game has finished the Compatibility 8 hour tests across hardware revisions and the 24-hour test, the compatibility tester will send mail to the Compatibility lab supervisor that the game has completed Compatibility and if it passed or failed.  If it failed the Test Case failure numbers will be sent in mail. The Compliance Lead will review all cases to ensure they are true reasons to fail the game for Compliance.  An email will be sent to the Certification Coordinator and Hardware contact that details the hardware incompatibilities and how they were found.

The hardware configuration for the build machine only requires one FAT32 partition. For the BVT machine, create two partitions (again, both FAT32). Connect the two machines using the null modem cable from port 1 on the BVT machine to port 1 on your  debugging  machine. This  debugging  machine can be your build machine. Software Setup 2.3.1 Setting up the Build machine Install (stock) Windows 2000 professional. Install Visual C++ 6 (with SP3) *DO NOT REGISTER ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES* Enlist in the XBox SLM tree (see   HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xcomer.doc"  \\cpitgcfs01\xboxro\src\public\idw\xcomer.doc install  file for the SLM project is   HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xboxenlist.cmd"  \\cpitgcfs01\xboxro\src\public\idw\xboxenlist.cmd Follow the rest of the instructions for setting up a razzle window. Create two folders on the root drive;   pvtrelease  and  release Share the  release  folder. Allow read-only access to the following cost centers: Hardware/Toddhol                   12686 BizDev/3rd Party/Jallard          12689 Mktg Jbooth/Dcoyner               12687 Platform/Toddro,Cameronf      12043 Mktg/Bethfe                           10991 Mktg/Done                             10987 Mktg/Edbland                         11184 / 12166 DX test  10892 DX dev  10894 2.3.2 Setting up the BVT machine The BVT machine should be a standard XBox Development Kit with 5 partitions and a DOS and Windows 2000 installation on the C drive. Create an  xboxbins  directory on the C partition.  This is where the latest build is copied before running the BVT.  Enable file sharing (RW) on the new directory, security setup is user discretion. Before The Build  re almost ready to begin the BVT. The following steps prepare you for the build. Build Machine: From a razzle window under  C:\xbox , run  ntsync  to update the SLM source tree.  You must baby-sit this process incase SLM requests user input. Under the   (type   in the razzle window) directory, edit the  setenv.cmd  file. Add / edit  SET _BUILDVER=[build #]  to reflect the latest build number. In %_NTROOT%\public\sdk\inc\ check out (using the out command)  xboxverp.h  and change the VER_PRODUCTBUILD accordingly. Don t forget to check in the file using the in command. Add three sub directories to %_NTDRIVE%\pvtrelease\usa\%_BUILDVER%\ ;  Checked Results Do this to the %_NTDRIVE\%\release\usa\%_BUILDVER%\ as well, without the  Results  folder. The Build / BVT Building the XBox OS: Build Machine: Start this process at 1:00 daily. From the root xbox directory in a razzle window, type  ntsync Once the sync has completed, in the razzle window, type  xbuild Running the BVT Once the build has completed, it should have copied itself to the %_NTDRIVE%\pvtrelease\usa\%_BUILDVER%\[Checked]/[Free] directories. BVT Machine: Copy the latest build (either checked or free) to the %_NTDRIVE%\xboxbins directory. Reboot the machine to the XBox OS partition. Type:  to run just the BVT tests. Stress   to run just the stress tests.  to run all tests. Build Machine: Before you execute the aforementioned commands on the BVT machine; Run either  BVT1.bat, BVT2.bat, BVT3.bat, BVT4.bat  to open a remote razzle window. Within these windows, type  i386kd Execute the appropriate command on the BVT machine. Watch the BVT go! Post BVT If the BVT has completed successfully, perform the following: BVT Machine: Copy the test logs from d: partition to the  results  folder on the build machine under the respective [free/checked] directories. Delete the logs on the BVT machine. Repeat section 4.2 for the other version. Build Machine: Copy the  verified  builds from the  pvtrelease  directory to the  release  directory under the proper build directory. Ensure the test logs are in their respective  results  directories.

It contains guidelines and rules, which, if followed, will help maintain consistency among test team members. One important document all new comers to the Xbox OS Team should read is the   HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xcomer.doc"  Xbox Newcomer Orientation  document.   Here is the original schedule of the Xbox OS, dated Feb 28, 2000. Here is the current schedule of the Xbox OS, dated ??? ??, 2001. Enlisting The Xbox Test Team will use the same SLM server as the Xbox Dev Team which is located on   HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xbox"  \\cpitgcfs01\xbox When following Section 4.1.1.3 ( Installing yourself as a New Developer ) in the    HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xcomer.doc"  Xbox Newcomer Orientation  document, you will need to enlist in these 4 SLM projects: PRIVATE, NTOS, SDKTOOLS, TEST.  To do this you will need to edit your \xbox\private\developr\%USERNAME%\setenv.cmd file to read as: Set NTPROJECTS=private ntos, sdktools test After successfully enlisting in these 4 projects your directories should look like this: Tree Structure and Rules All work done by members of the test team will be located under the \xbox\private\test directory.  The main subdirectories here are: Docs   Test team documents Tools   Test team common tools (such as our test harness, common libraries, logging tools, log parsers)  Test team common headers (such as logging header, common library headers)  Prop directory for test team common libraries.  All common libraries should be placefil d here.  Any components that have a dependency on a common library should link to this directory. Kernel   Kernel teams  tests SDK -- SDK teams  tests Network   Network teams  tests Online   Online teams  tests TestDll   A sample DLL you can build  TestExe   A sample EXE you can build It is important that directory names reflect the component they test   we should NEVER use a tester s name as the name of directory.  Test names should be related to their function to help identify them. Test Harness Overview The test harness consists of a process that runs on the Xbox test machine that loads test DLLs.  The test DLLs are executed in threads managed by the test harness and the DLLs log results (to a text file stored on the Xbox, or through OutputDebugString() statements to be captured using NTSD, or to a network location).  Another tool is then used to summarize the log files and then automatically posts the results to a web page which tracks the build number the test was ran on and the pass/fail/investigate status of the results and a link to the log files containing the results. The tool used to parse the logged output will verify that the output data is of the correct version before coalescing the data into a summary report.  This will allow us to update our log output as needed, or even to create custom logging modules, if needed.  (do we need this?) Writing Your Tests The tests you create will be DLLs that run within the test harness engine.  Your DLLs will need to provide specific test functions, but common test tool functions (such as logging) will be contained in a global library, which your DLL must load and use.  To get started quickly there is a sample DLL you can use a template in the directory \Xbox\private\tools\<harness_name>\SampleDLL of the SLM enlistment on your dev machine. Functional  Tests A full functional test run of the entire IIS test suite will be ran against DataCenter to ensure general functionality. Lab Stress Lab stress will be run to ensure DataCenter survives heavy-loads to a sustained period of time without failure. Ship Criteria (based on Win2000 opinion) is to survive: Beta (March 15, 2000), 21 days of long haul RTM (June 30, 2000), 28 days of long haul There are 4 types of machines that need to survive long haul: Single big box (8 proc, 8 GB RAM) 4-node cluster (specific 4 node enabled machines) 2-node cluster (can be any 2 machines) Regular server-class box (single/dual proc with 512 KB RAM) Office Stress Nightly office stress, how many machines/cyberbricks are required?  50 machines per night with 92% pass rate? CPU Scale-Testing Previously, Windows 2000 supported scaling to 8 CPUs.  DataCenter will support 16 CPUs (possibly 32 CPUs by OEMs).  Tests will be performed to ensure IIS makes proper use of 8 CPU and 16 CPU configurations with the expectations that increased client load can be handled (assuming no hardware bottleneck such as network I/O or disk I/O) when moved from 8 CPU to 16 CPU configuration.  All CPUs should be pushed to 100% CPU usage. RAM Scale-Testing Previously, Windows 2000 supported up to 8 GB of RAM.  DataCenter will support 16 GB (possibly 32 GB) of RAM.  Tests will be performed to ensure IIS makes proper use of 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM configurations with the expectations that increased client load can be handled (assuming no hardware bottleneck such as network I/O or disk I/O) when moved from 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM.   IIS should demonstrate that it benefits from increases in RAM because IIS will have access to a larger (in-memory) cache.    Note, we think we ll have an issue about IIS tsunami cache being restricted to a 4 GB max! Setting Up Your XBox Test Machine Overview Your Xbox test machine is the machine in which most resembles an actual Xbox console.  In the early stages of development it ll basically be a PC that uses video/sound/net/disk components that are similar to those which will be used on the actual console.  These early PC-based machines will also have keyboards, and monitors.  In later development stages we ll have custom-built mainboards and chassis s, which will contain custom burned EEPROMs/ROM chips, which will more accurately resemble the final console.  These later-stage machines won t have a keyboard and may have a TV (instead of a computer monitor). Setting Up a PC-Based XBox To set up a PC-based Xbox, you should read Section 4.2 ( Setting Up Your Xbox Target Machine ) in the    HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xcomer.doc"  Xbox Newcomer Orientation  document. Briefly, these are the steps: Make your Xbox PC dual bootable with 2 partitions.  Put Windows98 on C: and  Win2000 Professional on D: Boot into Windows 2000 Professional and tweak some settings (MUST do this before installing the Xbox OS). Make a backup of the Windows 2000 Professional files. Modify your C:\BOOT.INI file so that your Windows 2000 Professional boot entry will appear as the Xbox boot entry (and enable /DEBUG). Boot into your Windows 98 partition. Copy the Xbox OS files to your Windows 2000 Professional installation directory/partition. Reboot your machine into the Xbox OS boot entry!  At this point you should have a machine that is Dual Bootable between  Windows 98  (C: drive) and  Xbox OS  (D: drive). Running Tests During  Step 6  (Section 4.2 of this document), you can also copy the test harness binaries and the test DLLs.  When your Xbox OS boots the test harness will automatically run.  When the harness runs it will load information from an .INI file which tells it which test DLLs should be loaded and executed.  Setting Up a Console-Based XBox To set up a Console-based Xbox    tbd.

Injector Automated testing Hardware needed:  For alpha-2 release: standard Xbox dev-kit, including nv20 card For Beta release: xbox hardware with UMA architecture Exposed Methods and Enumerations: enum D3DMEMORY { D3DMEMORY_AGP = 0, D3DMEMORY_VIDEO = 1, D3DMEMORY_FORCE_DWORD = 0xffffffff HRESULT IDirect3DDevice::MoveResource(IDirect3DResource8*, D3DMEMORY); MoveResource will: Successfully move the resource to the memory location provided Do nothing if the resource is already in that memory location Return an error code if not enough memory is available Return D3D_OK if everything worked (note: MoveResource may be changed (before alpha 2) to return VOID) Description: MoveResource will be used to move various resources (vertex buffers, texture maps, etc) into video memory (and back to UMA-Emulated / AGP memory) in order to have speed similar to the final hardware. In addition to speed, nv20 requires that all render targets be in video memory, so MoveResource must be used to move any resources used as render targets into video memory. Test Methods: Focus: The goal of testing is to ensure that MoveResource will allow speedy transfers of resources between the two memory locations, without corruption, leaks, or crashing. MoveResource must also not be bloated in size, and must work while also using various other xbox routines (Sound, usb, networking, etc). In addition, the transition between Alpha hardware and final hardware must be as minimal as possible. For beta release, MoveResource will be changed to an empty inline function, with same return type, in order to minimize work for the game developers. Tests must also ensure that the resources function properly once in the new memory location. It should be noted that UMA emulation will be covered pretty thoroughly by the rest of D3D tests, since all resources except auto-frame/depth buffers will be created in UMA-emulated / AGP memory. Tests: Performance: Tests will provide performance data for moving the resources, and their speed after moving. Code Reviews: MoveResource will be included and reviewed in d3d code reviews. MoveResource will be included in all appropriate types of d3d tests (api, perf, bvt, etc) Test complete criteria: Once all appropriate tests have been written, test development for D3D UMA emulation can be declared complete Release criteria: All tests should pass in order to sign off on a release candidate.  If a shipping build is being considered for a specific title, all tests covering the features used by the title must pass.  The only failure cases acceptable in a release are those whose repro steps are declared too obscure to be hit by ISVs, a determination made by triage on a case-by-case basis.

We need a process to create these for each cost reduction cycle / each cost reduced component. The process for figuring this out will be part of this overall process: hardware team proposes cost reduction change / component change and notifies all interested parties, and provides a proposed schedule for this hardware to be introduced so we can plan the testing. hardware and software team sit down and figure out how to test this Major components, like a DVD Rom drive, have gone through this cycle before, we have release criteria established for them (sort of   marcw/johndaly), and test tools / processes we use that we use to see whether the items meet the required performance and functional specifications. Minor components, such as a the TV encoder chip, may require an original or improved plan so we can target testing that component. A good spec is provided to the vendor so they can make sure they are making what we want. This spec must include measurable release criteria that then be taken into account when writing the test tools. A test plan (specifically, the test plan from step 2 above) is provided to the vendor so they can pre-test. This can be the same test plan we use, or one more tailored to their situation. For devices that we can write test software to use for testing, the tools are provided to the vendor along with complete instructions for their use. Tools may need some modification to work off-site. Tools will ideally provide data the vendor can use to determine whether their item meets our release criteria. When appropriate, a hardware test platform is supplied to the vendor to use for the duration of the testing. For items such as a DVD Rom drive, we can supply retail consoles, and retail signed tests for them to use. If the vendor requires debugging capabilities, the vendor will need to be supplied with devkits and the appropriate software. When the vendor has demonstrated that their component is ready for testing, it will be submitted to us in quantity sufficient for our testing as determined in the test plan created in step 2. At this point, the hardware and software test team stage in their respective labs and start testing. Once the tests have started, we need to get a feel for how things look and adjust the plan. Schedule another round of what happened in step 2 to make sure that we are doing the right thing. If we need to make a change, we iterate through the appropriate steps above to make the plan conform to reality. If we did everything right, there will be minimal iteration here. If we messed up, this is our chance to correct it. If we keep messing up, we ll have the same kind of fun that we did with the DVD Rom drives Once we have the tests running and adjusted as needed, the results are added to the weekly hardware test report. Results need to include failure data, pass rates, bug #, etc. Here I will enumerate the types of testing that we do for Xbox (mostly from the software perspective, but a lot of it will apply across the board) Kernel software testing File System Memory manager Threads Startup / system boot / initialization XDK library testing Graphics Sound Input Xbox-specific APIs (saved games, etc) Win32 APIs Network APIs Dashboard Sample code tests Debugger / development system tests Test for setting up the debugger / development tools Hardware Test Support DVD ROM tests Hard drive tests Memory tests Graphics tests Input / USB tests / USB simulator Stress testing Run all of the software tests above simultaneously to stress the system BVT Tests Run all the tests above sequentially after each build to uncover bugs in the current build Spec reviews For each proposed hardware change, these questions must be answered: Who owns the spec<provide a pointer>? 2.)  Where is the spec<provide a pointer>? 3.)  Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? Tools needed For the purpose of testing cost reduced / 2nd sourced hardware components, we ll need 2 classes of tools, some of which we already have and can be adapted for this purpose, some of which we ll have to develop as needed. Class 1, support and test framework tools XDK launcher (need docs - jimhelm) This tool provides a menuing system from which specific tests can be selected by the console operator using a controller XLog logging system (test\docs\logging.doc) This provides logging to disk, to kernel debugger, and to server, the logging can be controlled from the testini.ini file that the test harness uses to initialize the test. Test Harness (test\docs\x-box test harness.doc and test\docs\ini file structure and functions.doc) This is an executable image that has all the required tests bound into it. It runs the tests as specified in the testini.ini file. Test Server (need docs - jpoley) Test Results web page (need docs - jpoley Class 2, specific tests (some of which are written and ready to integrate, some of which can be adapted from existing test code and made to conform to hardware test needs) hard disk functionality and perf test tools (jpoley/t-msanto/johndaly) DVD ROM drive functionality and perf test tool (jpoley/t-msanto) USB / Input functionality and perf test tool (jpoley/t-msanto) Network functionality and perf test tool (jimhelm) Memory functionality and perf test tool (jpoley/t-msanto) Graphics / TV encoder functionality and perf  test tool (mattbron) Automated power cycling tests (jpoley/johndaly) What the finished Hardware test product needs to look like and do use the harness for control / management / logging support use the launcher for test start if possible, display test status / pass fail / %complete stats on the screen if possible, control input through the USB   for example, stop / start test, etc  Test run logs to server, and web page for test run created for results distribution Hardware needed To do this, we need new hardware, or components mounted in old hardware / XDKs. We prefer XDK type kits, we can attach a kernel debugger and debug low-level problems more effectively. Test methods Test code This was covered above. Manual tests Currently, we are contracting out the manual final integration / manual power cycling tests. Automated power cycling tests are good, but the power-cycle interval is fixed, which does not cover real world scenarios. The manual power cycling tests cost ~$50k / week to perform. And automated solution to this would be nice, but would require specialized hardware (sethmil can probably make this for us, a programmable interval electronic switching thing that could run a bench of 25 boxes would be cool). Also covered by manual tests has been media detect testing for the Dashboard / DVD ROM drive. I don t see any way to automate most of this, since the disk needs to be changed. The service costs ~$50k / week. Last but not least, game testing. All hardware must perform the same, all games must play the same. Something that changes can make a game play better, but that same change may degrade another game. We have been using vendors managed by the certification test team for game testing. The group that does the functional testing part of cert testing will most likely be responsible for backwards compatibility testing new consoles with old games. Configuration tests All configurations must be tested using the entire test process, from component-level to game play before release. Performance testing The tools described above must also test performance using techniques that give meaningful results so that components may be compared with like components. If a performance change is noted, then game play testing must occur to make sure that no titles get broken. If no performance change is noted, game play must still be tested, but can be done so less intensively than for the case where there is a significant change. After low level component testing happens, the appropriate game play test must be scheduled.  Catastrophic failure testing Any component that suffers catastrophic failure must be evaluated for frequency of failure, and that data analyzed by competent, senior management before it is allowed to ship. We have not done a whole lot of thinking in that area, so our criteria are spotty. Marc Whitten and John Daly have written criteria for aspects of the DVD ROM drive, criteria of a similar nature must be developed for any changed components. Test complete criteria The test is complete when the test us usable by suppliers, the hardware team, and the software team. Tests must be easy to use, and provide numbers that are compatible with the release criteria mentioned elsewhere in this doc (the release criteria must be developed for each changed components). Release criteria Release criteria, as mentioned above, must be developed for each item as early as possible in the process outlined above so that the test tools know what to look for. This should be part of the spec process.

INI file structure and functions TitleINI file structure and functions johndaly Normal.dot Sakphong Chanbai Microsoft Word 9.0INI file structure and functions By John Daly, Kernel Test Lead To use INI files effectively, we need to access them in a consistent way. We ll steal the following API s from Win2K and implement them ourselves. We can also get the source code from Win2k. We may want to Unicode-ize them. If we have all of these API s, we can make the INI file as complex as we wish, but if we want to stick with the simple version below, we can cut several of these. Copied from MSDN, you can look at full descriptions there: Initialization-File Functions Initialization-file functions obtain information from and copy information to a system- or application-defined initialization file. The Windows initialization file (Win.ini) is a special file that contains entry-value pairs representing run-time options for applications. These functions are provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8microsoft Memory and Resource Leak Detection on NT Title _PID_GUID _PID_HLINKSMemory and Resource Leak Detection on NT john daly Leaks Matt Bandy Microsoft Word 8.0zy,inMemory and Resource Leak Detection on NT What are leaks and why are they bad?: A leak is a loss of resources caused by creation or allocation of a resource and failure to free the resource.  You can leak resources such as memory, user and gdi objects, handles, threads, etc. Leaks are a problem because system resources are limited, even under NT, and when the system becomes low on resources, it can impact not only the leaking process, but other process and the entire system as well. Symptoms of leaks: There are many ways customers are affected by leaks.  We have seen machines slow down, problems with apps ranging from not being able to start to not displaying text correctly.  Some of these things are caused by a low memory situation brought about by the leak.  Sometimes there may be a lot of memory left, but there are lots of allocations left around that slow down memory management functions.  Other times we have seen handle counts increase.  There are also pool leaks, which occur when the pool memory (memory used by the NT kernel and drivers) is consumed.  This can occur when an app leaks bitmaps, for example, which cause memory to be allocated in the kernel s pool.  When the app exits or frees the bitmaps, the memory is freed.  Bad drivers may also cause pool leaks.  There is a finite amount of memory allocated for usage by the pool, you can use pmon to see what that amount is. Customer impact of leaks: When a customer s machine enters a low memory condition that was caused by a leak, they will perceive several things.  There is a popup  System out of virtual memory .  If the customer has only one app open and sees this message, it can be very confusing.  You can do easily this with many versions of MS-Word. Strange app and system behavior.  When the machine is out of memory, applications that do not behave well in low memory are stressed, and this can cause problems like improper displays, abnormal termination, etc. Slowdown in the system.  When there is a lot of memory allocated, it can cause excessive swapping which will slow down the system. When the above situations are encountered by users, it isn t always obvious to them that there is a leak.  All they see is their system acting abnormally.  Bugs that cause faults and exception in a repeatable manner are less of a problem since they usually have causal actions associated with them.  The customer sees this and can work around it.  Leaks can manifest themselves in a way that appears to be random failure.  An application can fail at many different points in a situation where there are not enough resources to carry out the desired operation. When customers start seeing apparently  random  failures, their first thought is not  I have a bad app leaking memory and that is causing instability in my system , it is  this is an unstable operating system Pool leaks - these can be especially mysterious since you can exhaust pool memory even though you have plenty of swapfile left. Tools: Bounds Checker. (Nu-Mega Technologies) There are versions of this tool for Win31, NT, and Win95, and a less than fully functional version ships with Visual Test.  It provides parameter validation for API s, checks memory accesses, has memory and resource leak detection.  It is suitable for stand alone processes, it cannot be used to test system components (you can t test the kernel with it!).  It is easy to use, it will take you to the line of code that caused the problem.  It requires binaries to be built with debug information.  Suitable for testers and developers. PMON.EXE (MS) This is a very easy to use tool.  It is available from   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\<buildnum>\\  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\<buildnum>\ <x86 | alpha>\<fre | chk>.<wks | srv>  (ie \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks\mstools).  It provides a wealth of information on processes running on the system.  Many common leaks can be found using this tool. You need to pay special attention to the commit charge and to the number of handles, these are usually the best leak indicators.  Commit charge is the amount of memory in pages that is allocated to a process.  Here is a sample display: Memory:   65072K Avail:   4108K  PageFlts:   251 InRam Kernel: 3020K P:10196K  Commit:  96340K/  60568K Limit: 176416K Peak: 182560K  Pool N: 4312K P:19504K                 Mem  Mem   Page   Flts Commit  Usage   Pri  Hnd Thd  Image CPU  CpuTime  Usage Diff   Faults Diff Charge NonP Page     Cnt Cnt  Name               17936    0  5270504    6                             File Cache 99  93:27:32     16    0        1    0      0    0    0  0    0  2 Idle Process  0   0:11:53     24    0     4657    0    252    0    0  8  222 32 System  0   0:00:02      0    0     6146    0    168    1    4 11   32  6 smss.exe  0   0:14:56   2672  112   176533  207   7084    6   25 13  429 20 csrss.exe  0   0:00:06    648    0    12658    0   1760   14   19 13  172 12 winlogon.exe  0   0:00:21   1072    0    31432    0   2572  240   21  9  499 31 services.exe  0   0:00:10    656    0    48168    0   2116   50   21  9  288 13 lsass.exe  0   0:00:01   1076    0     8042    0   1620   13   16  8   98 10 spoolsv.exe  0   0:00:02    360    0    19194    0    928  180   12  8  226 10 RpcSs.exe  0   0:00:00      0    0      767    0   1020   11   16  8   49  2 scesrv.exe  0   0:00:01    124    0     9147    0    828  107   17  8   79  6 MSTask.exe  0   0:00:03     80    0    62217    0   1292    4   18  8   80  8 ntmssvc.exe  0   0:00:00    388    0    16520    0   1356    5   16  8  105 10 sens.exe  0   0:00:00    132    0    17509    0    648    2   11  8   47  4 esserver.exe  0   0:00:04    120    0     6645    0   1012    4   18  8   43  1 SysTray.Exe  0   0:00:01    360    0    16576    0   1828   22   21  8  208 11 svchost.exe  0   0:19:25   6788    0    74848    0   5152  152   36  8  199  8 exchng32.exe  0   0:40:21   1700    0   583789   24    444    2   14 13   30  3 taskmgr.exe  0   0:00:02    780    0     9706    0   1388   85   22  8  103  8 MAPISP32.EXE  0   0:00:00    100    0     6134    0   1120   12   15  8   86 11 tapisrv.exe  0   0:00:45    940    0    10821    0   2920    2   16  8   21  1 vs.exe  0   0:02:47   1740    0    74002    0   4304    7   28  8  177  8 Explorer.exe  0   0:01:39    372    0    20379    0   3728    4   20  8   61  2 raid4.exe  0   0:00:09    952    0     6265    0   2372    5   39  8   81  4 excel.exe  0   0:00:00     20    0      326    0    348    1   14  8   23  1 CMD.exe  0   0:00:01      0    0      593    0    576    1   14  8   22  1 CMD.exe  0   0:00:25    668    0     8801    0   3884    4   18  8   50  3 Opera.exe  0   0:00:00     24    0      751    0    676   11   14  8   45  9 netdde.exe  0   0:00:20   7216    0     4757    0   4232    5   30  8  206  4 IV5.EXE  0   0:00:00    488    0      685    0    344    1   14  8   23  1 CMD.exe  0   0:00:45  11832    0     9662    0   4236    8   65  8  150  3 Winword.exe  0   0:00:00    484   20      228   14    360    1    6 13    9  1 pmon.exe CPU: % of the CPU used in the last 5 seconds.

They are good for developers to use for tracking down leaks.  They are easily incorporated into batch files and can be called from scripts. dh.exe:   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\<buildnum>\\  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\<buildnum>\ <x86 | alpha>\<fre | chk>.<wks | srv>  (ie \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks\idw) dhcmp.exe:   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\<buildnum>\\  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\<buildnum>\ <x86 | alpha>\<fre | chk>.<wks | srv>  (ie   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\latest.tst\\x86\\fre.wks\\mstools  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks\ Usage:  DH: Default _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to D:\WINNT\Symbols Usage: DH [-p n | -p -1 | -p 0 [-k] [-o]] [-l] [-m] [-s] [-g] [-h] [-t] [-f file Name] where: -p n - displays information about process with ClientId of n in DH_n.dmp        -p -1 - displays information about Win32 Subsystem process in DH_WIN32.DMP.        -l - displays information about locks.        -m - displays information about module table.        -s - displays summary information about heaps.        -g - displays information about memory hogs.        -h - displays information about heap entries for each heap.        -t - displays information about heap tags for each heap.        -b - displays information about stack back trace database.        -i - ignore information about stack back trace database.        -p 0 - displays information about kernel memory and objects in DH_SYS.DMP.        -o - displays information about object handles (only valid with -p 0).        -k - displays information about processes and threads (only valid with -p 0).        -f fileName - specifies the name of the file to write the dump to.        -# n - sets buffer size to n Meg        -- specifies the dump output should be written to stdout.        Default flags for -p n are -s -g        Default flags for -p 0 are -m -s -g -t -k -o DHCMP has two modes: 1)  DHCMP [-d] [-v] dh_dump1.txt dh_dump2.txt     This compares two DH dumps, useful for finding leaks.     dh_dump1.txt & dh_dump2.txt are obtained before and after some test     scenario.  DHCMP matches the backtraces from each file and calculates     the increase in bytes allocated for each backtrace. These are then     displayed in descending order of size of leak     The first line of each backtrace output shows the size of the leak in     bytes, followed by the (last-first) difference in parentheses.     Leaks of size 0 are not shown.  Specifying  v will include the full     stack backtraces and the increase in number of allocations for each      backtrace as well as the information listed above. 2)  DHCMP [-d] dh_dump.txt     For each allocation backtrace, the number of bytes allocated will be     attributed to each callsite (each line of the backtrace).  The number     of bytes allocated per callsite are summed and the callsites are then     displayed in descending order of bytes allocated.  This is useful for     finding a leak that is reached via many different codepaths.     ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap@12 will appear first when analyzing DH dumps of     csrss.exe, since all allocation will have gone through that routine.     Similarly, ProcessApiRequest will be very prominent too, since that     appears in most allocation backtraces.  Hence the useful thing to do     with mode 2 output is to use dhcmp to comapre two of them:         dhcmp dh_dump1.txt > tmp1.txt         dhcmp dh_dump2.txt > tmp2.txt         dhcmp tmp1.txt tmp2.txt     the output will show the differences.

This help To use DH, run x86 checked builds (these are the only builds that support this, in the future, this capability may be extended to free builds ant to RISC builds) with the following global flag settings and application flag settings (manipulate with gflags.exe) To enable checking with DH on your application, build with NTNOFPO=1 set in your environment. (which means, for those of you not using NT build, disable the FPO optimization as explained here: frame pointer optimization: the /Oy option for the cl386 compiler Syntax The /Oy option suppresses creation of frame pointers on the call stack. This option speeds function calls, since no frame pointers need to be set up and removed. It also frees one more register, EBP, for storing frequently used variables and subexpressions. The /Ox (full optimization) and /O2 (fast code) options imply /Oy. The /Oy  option overrides /Oy whether it is explicit or implied. So, to build your component for leak checking on NT, use this compiler switch: /Oy- ) System registry settings to use DH (set using gflags.exe): For user-mode stack traces, select the following options in gflags: Select  Create user mode stack trace DB Click  Apply Click  For kernel-mode stack traces, select the following options in gflags: Select  Create kernel mode stack trace DB Click  Apply Click  Application registry settings to use DH on a particular process (set using gflags.exe): In the  Image File Options  box in gflags, enter the name of the executable (ie windbg.exe) Select  Create user mode stack trace DB Click  Apply Click  How to read DH and DHCMP logs: DH Logs: *********** Module Information ******************** Number of loaded modules: 20 Module01 (00,19,65535): [015b0000 .. 015f9fff] D:\WINNTCHK\Explorer.exe Module02 (01,01,65535): [77f30000 .. 77fa6fff] D:\WINNTCHK\System32\ntdll.dll *********** Heap 00340000 Information ******************** information about each heap in a process *********** Heap 00340000 Hogs ******************** stack traces for largest heaps *********** Lock Information ******************** NumberOfLocks == 80 Lock1 at 77f903a0 (CriticalSection)     Contention: 0     Usage: 502     Owner:   (ThreadID == 54) sample stack trace from a heap allocation: 000010f8 bytes by: BackTrace02658  (NTDLL!LDR Database)         ntdll!RtlDebugAllocateHeap+0x14d         ntdll!RtlAllocateHeapSlowly+0x4e         ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+0x9ef         SHELL32!_InitializeTask+0x5b         SHELL32!SHGetHandlerEntry+0xd3         SHELL32!_CreateInstance+0x18         SHELL32!SHCoCreateInstance+0x1ee         SHELL32!DCA_CreateInstance+0x23         SHELL32!HDXA_AppendMenuItems+0xfa         SHELL32!CDefFolderMenu_QueryContextMenu+0x200         Explorer!StartMenuFolder_ContextMenu+0xcf         Explorer!TrayWndProc+0x721         USER32!DispatchClientMessage+0x7f         USER32!__fnDWORD+0x24         ntdll!KiUserCallbackDispatcher+0x13         USER32!ButtonWndProcW+0x60 You can see that there is lots of information available from this tool.  By using some of the other switches, you can get even more, I am just showing you the basics. DHCMP Logs: these logs show the difference between 2 DH dumps, and they look like this: +    10f8 ( 10f8 -    0)        BackTrace02658  (NTDLL!LDR Database) +     bf8 (  bf8 -    0)        BackTrace03705  (BASEDLL!LMEM) +     a00 (  f00 -  500)        BackTrace01532  (BASEDLL!LMEM) +     810 (  d70 -  560)        BackTrace00623  (NTDLL!LDR Database)  means an increase in size, the next number is the size of the change, the numbers in brackets are the computation of the size difference (log1 size - log2 size),  the BackTraceXXXXX is a reference to the stack trace in the DH log.  So, for the first listing in the DHCMP log, the corresponding DH log entry is the preceding stack trace.   The best way to use these tools is to run test variations several times in a row, and run DH between the iterations, then at the end use DHCMP to diff the logs. At the end of this document, I will discuss test case design to help you get the most out of this technology. In a nutshell, you can run the tests like this: Testvar DH -p <pid of test process> -f log1 Testvar DH -p <pid of test process> -f log2 DHCMP log1 log2>comp.log Debug Heap Manager (MS) (information courtesy of Tom McGuire) Instructions for enabling and using the PageHeap testing feature in Windows NT. 1) Overview of PageHeap testing feature. 2) Configuring your system to enable the PageHeap testing feature. 3) Using the PageHeap testing feature. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) Overview of PageHeap testing feature. A common problem in application development is heap corruption.  This typically occurs when an application allocates a block of heap memory of a given size and then writes to memory addresses beyond the requested size of the heap block:     pszString = malloc( strlen( "SomeText" ));     strcpy( pszString, "SomeText" ); In this example, pszString references a heap allocation of 8 bytes (strlen of "SomeText"), but the strcpy function will write 9 bytes into the pszString allocation because strcpy also copies the terminating NULL character which is not included in the strlen calculation.  This particular example is probably the most common source of heap corruption. Another common cause of heap corruption is writing to block of memory that has already been freed:     pStruct = malloc( sizeof( *pStruct ));     free( pStruct );     pStruct->Member = 0; In this example, consider what would happen if the heap manager assigned the block of memory freed by the "free( pStruct )" statement to another allocation (possibly in another thread) before the "pStruct->Member = 0" statement was executed. There are various testing tools and techniques available to application developers for catching heap corruption problems in applications, but most of these techniques only catch the corruption at some point after the corruption occurs.  Even after learning that corruption did occur, it can still be difficult to trace through the code to find the source of the corruption. To help developers find heap corruption problems faster and more reliably, we designed the PageHeap testing feature into the Windows NT heap manager.  When the PageHeap feature is enabled for an application, all heap allocations in that application (including heap allocations from all DLL's in that process) are placed in memory such that the end of the heap allocation is aligned with the end of a virtual page of memory with the following page of virtual memory set to NO_ACCESS.  With the heap allocation aligned at the end of virtual page, any memory reads or writes beyond the end of the heap allocation will cause an immediate access violation in the application which can be caught within a debugger to show the developer the exact line of code that is causing heap corruption.  And similar for freed heap allocations, the PageHeap manager changes the freed allocation's virtual page protection to NO_ACCESS so that an access violation will occur if the application attempts to read or write memory in the freed heap block. The PageHeap feature will work for all heap allocations made through the Win32 heap APIs (HeapAlloc, GlobalAlloc, and LocalAlloc) as well as any C-runtime heap functions (malloc, calloc) that are implemented with the Win32 heap APIs. It will not work for C-runtime heap functions where the C-runtime library implements its own heap manager rather than using the Win32 heap manager. With the PageHeap feature enabled for an application, the application will run a little bit slower and require quite a bit more virtual memory (pagefile size) than normal because each heap allocation requires two full pages of virtual memory (a virtual page is 4096 bytes on most systems or 8192 bytes on some systems).  Depending on an application's heap usage, it might be necessary to increase the size of the system's pagefile while using the PageHeap testing feature to avoid getting "Out of Virtual Memory" error messages.  It is not advisable to run more than one application with the PageHeap feature enabled at the same time unless the system has a very large pagefile. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2) Configuring your system to enable the PageHeap testing feature. The PageHeap testing feature is only available in Windows NT 4.0 and above, and it is only available while running the "checked" version of NTDLL.DLL (we did not want to add the overhead of this testing feature in the "retail" version of NTDLL.DLL for obvious performance reasons) except on NT 5.0, where it will run on  the free version.  While the recommended method of using the PageHeap testing feature  is to install and run a "checked" version of Windows NT (install Windows NT from the  Windows NT "checked" CD), it is possible to use the PageHeap testing feature on an  ordinary "retail" installation of Windows NT by replacing the retail version of  NTDLL.DLL with the checked version (note that this is not necessary on NT 5.0). Here are the instructions for replacing the system's retail NTDLL.DLL with the checked version.  WARNING: if any of these steps fail, or if for some reason the checked NTDLL.DLL doesn't run correctly, the system will fail to boot.  It will then be necessary to restore the original NTDLL.DLL either by using the emergency repair option in Windows NT Setup, or by booting another operating system and re-copying the original NTDLL.DLL. Assuming the Windows NT SDK has already been installed such that the rebase.exe program is in the PATH, and assuming Z: is the CD-ROM drive containing the Windows NT checked version, and assuming the system is an x86 system (change as necessary), from a CMD prompt:     cd /d %SystemRoot%\system32     copy z:\i386\ntdll.dll .\ntdll.chk     rebase -b 60100000 ntdll.chk     ren ntdll.dll ntdll.sav     ren ntdll.chk ntdll.dll     <shutdown and reboot> The rebase step is necessary to avoid DLL address collisions with other system DLLs because the checked version of NTDLL.DLL requires a larger address range than the retail version.  If the rebase step is not performed, the system will fail to boot. If renaming ntdll.dll fails indicating that ntdll.dll is in use by another process, Windows NT may be started with the /debug load option.   Remove the /debug option to rename ntdll.dll. Once the Windows NT system is running with a checked version of NTDLL.DLL, the PageHeap feature can be used. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) Using the PageHeap testing feature. The PageHeap testing feature can be enabled and disabled for individual applications with the pageheap.exe program or with gflags.exe on NT 5.0.   The pageheap.exe program takes the name of the application followed by  either the /enable or /disable option.  The application binary is not read or  modified by the pageheap.exe program   the program merely stores some  information in the system registry that is later referenced when the application  is started. Once the PageHeap feature is enabled for an application, every time the application is started it will run with heap allocations placed at the ends of virtual pages.  It is recommended that the application be started under control of a debugger while using the PageHeap feature so that access violations can be caught by the debugger rather than by the application's own structured exception handling mechanism.  Even if the application is started outside of a debugger (like with the Start menu), it will still run with the PageHeap feature enabled and fault if/when it encounters a heap violation. So, the steps to run an application with the PageHeap feature enabled are:     pageheap.exe appname.exe /enable      (or use gflags.exe on NT 5.0 and select  Place heap allocations at ends of pages     start appname.exe (or launch the app from a debugger)     use the app normally until an access violation occurs     debug the app to determine why it referenced memory         outside the allocated heap block (or inside the         freed heap block). To assist developers in debugging applications that fault while using the PageHeap feature, we've included some debugger extensions for the NTSD debugger program.  The NTSD debugger program can be found on the Windows NT checked CD under the \support\debug\i386 directory (or \support\debug\mips etc).  To use the NTSD debugger with PageHeap extensions, the NTSDEXTS.DLL file must be in the system PATH.  Once the application faults under the NTSD debugger, the PageHeap debugger extensions can be used from the NTSD debugger prompt.  For example, if the application caused an access violation attempting to write memory at address 0x455000, type this at the NTSD prompt:     !ntsdexts.dphfind 455000 The debugger will respond with something like this:     PAGEHEAP: 455000 is 0x1 bytes beyond the end of allocated heap block at               454ff8 of 0x8 bytes, allocated by:               77f3794b ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+a0e               77ed5e09 kernel32!LocalAlloc+0x71               0040101d testapp!main+0x1d               004010f5 testapp!mainCRTStartup+0xc1 Note that the stack backtrace of the point where the heap block was allocated is only available on x86 systems, and the symbolic names of the stack backtrace addresses are only available if the appropriate .dbg files have been installed (see the SDK documentation). In addition to the "!ntsdexts.dphfind" debugger extension, there are also "!ntsdexts.dphdump" and "!ntsdexts.dphhogs" debugger extensions that are specific to applications running with the PageHeap testing feature. If the app you're trying to debug uses the msvcrt.dll malloc/new for its heap allocations, the NT5 version of MSVCRT.DLL contains its own small block suballocator.  To get the pageheap behavior on malloc/new calls going through MSVCRT.DLL, you need to disable the small block suballoctor when you start your app.  Assuming you have good msvcrt symbols, at the initial breakpoint in the debugger (or whenever you want the msvcrt malloc/new calls to start going to the Win32 heap apis), set the msvcrt!__sbh_threshold value to zero.  In ntsd, it would look like this: 0:000> ed msvcrt!__sbh_threshold<Enter> 7803e3ec 000001e0 0<Enter> 7803e3f0 ffffffff <Enter> 0:000> g If you have good msvcrt symbols, the __sbh_threshold default value should show up initially as 0x1E0. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We hope you find the PageHeap testing feature useful for tracking down heap corruption problems in applications. This heap tool has already helped track down many bugs throughout the system.  If you have any questions or problems using this heap tool, contact Tommcg. Memsnap.exe, Poolsnap.exe, Memfilt.exe, Poolfilt.exe, Sortlog.exe (MS) Memsnap works like pmon, except it puts all the information in a file.  Poolsnap works like poolmon, except it puts all the pool information into a file.  Pool tagging must be enabled to do this, and it works on a free build, use the gflags.exe application to enable pool tagging.  Sortlog sorts the file so you get the information in an easier to understand format.  Memfilt and Poolfilt are used after sortlog on Memsnap and Poolsnap output respectively to produce a brief summary of the information contained in these files.  Poolsnap.exe, Poolfilt.exe and Sortlog.exe are available on    HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\<buildnum>\\  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\<buildnum>\ <x86 | alpha>\<fre | chk>.<wks | srv> \dump Memsnap.exe and Memfilt.exe are available on   HYPERLINK \\\\ntbuilds\\release\\usa\\<buildnum>\\  \\ntbuilds\release\usa\<buildnum>\ <x86 | alpha>\<fre | chk>.<wks | srv> \idw (ie \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks\dump).  Just run them with the /? switch and they will tell you what command line parameters are used.  memsnap.exe log entry: Process ID           Proc.Name Wrkng.Set PagedPool  NonPgdPl  Pagefile    Commit   Handles   Threads          0              (null)     16384         0         0         0         0         0         1          2              System     24576         0         0     40960     36864       304        23         18            smss.exe    122880       929      1224    167936    167936        30         6         22           csrss.exe   1011712     15500      3824   1155072   1122304       204         7         32        winlogon.exe     16384     12090     10820    479232    471040        41         2         38        services.exe    876544     15889    109936   1241088   1232896       246        21         41           lsass.exe    675840     11234     16112    684032    675840       105        13         68         spoolss.exe    286720     12991     16060   1064960   1056768       103         8         83           RpcSs.exe    131072     10684   1314076    622592    602112        95         7        112        nddeagnt.exe     20480      9288      1796    286720    278528        16         1        121        Explorer.exe    610304     14000      3668    921600    876544        69         5         54         taskmgr.exe    774144     10663      2160    323584    294912        28         3         56             cmd.exe    892928     10836      1848    380928    372736        21         1        125         tapisrv.exe    389120     12400     11756    655360    651264        88        12        106          rasman.exe   1675264     15115      5176    880640    876544       156        11        144           ntvdm.exe     36864     25864      3544   1933312   1843200        50         2        173             cmd.exe    446464     10836      2004    438272    421888        21         1         92         WINWORD.EXE   5988352     43545      4344   1966080   1617920        85         2        163           sleep.exe    454656      3762       964    118784    114688         9         1    169         memsnap.exe    557056      3778      1120    249856    245760        10         1 sortlog-sorted memsnap entries: Process ID           Proc.Name Wrkng.Set PagedPool  NonPgdPl  Pagefile    Commit   Handles   Threads          0              (null)     16384         0         0         0         0         0         1          0              (null)     16384         0         0         0         0         0         1          2              System     24576         0         0     40960     36864       304        23          2              System     24576         0         0     40960     36864       304        23         18            smss.exe    122880       929      1224    167936    167936        30         6         18            smss.exe    122880       929      1224    167936    167936        30         6         22           csrss.exe   1011712     15500      3824   1155072   1122304       204         7         22           csrss.exe   1024000     15626      3928   1155072   1122304       209         7         32        winlogon.exe     16384     12090     10820    479232    471040        41         2         32        winlogon.exe     16384     12090     10820    479232    471040        41         2         38        services.exe    876544     15889    109936   1241088   1232896       246        21         38        services.exe    876544     15889    109936   1241088   1232896       246        21         41           lsass.exe    675840     11234     16112    684032    675840       105        13         41           lsass.exe    663552     11234     16008    667648    659456       104        12 Sample memfilt output (note that this does not correspond to the example sortlog/memsnap output above):           8              System                                 654->      3049 !

By default, processes for which neither the number of open allocations nor the number of bytes allocated increase are not listed in the poolfilt output.

Ntlog.dll (MS) Ntlog.dll that is used by NTGUI for logging has the functionality of memsnap built in.  The information is incorporated with the other logging information. You can find it in the nttest project. Debugger Extensions.(MS) These are DLL s that contain procedures to dump important data structures, etc.  The procedures are called from the debugger.  These are subject to change.  To find out what we have, copy *.exts into your \system32 directory.  In the debugger, type !<extname>.help for a current listing of the functions in the DLL. There is more documentation of debugging available: \\ntstress\docs\debug.* Checked system.(MS) You should run you application under the checked build of NT and monitor all debugger output.  This can reveal problems that you might otherwise not see.  It is also required for other leak checking tools. Oh.exe/Ohcmp.exe (MS) Oh.exe lists the open handles held by a particular process, their types, and the names of the objects they are handles to.  In general, you will want to invoke it as oh  p PID  a.  (-a causes handles to unnamed objects to be reported.)  Ohcmp.exe can be run on two OH outputs to find differences between the two.  By default, Ohcmp reports only increases, but this can be configured with a command line option.  Run ohcmp /? for details.

Test Design: Simple leak testing model. This is a very simple test model. Run the same variation at least twice in a row, and measure your memory usage between each run and at the end (more runs can be better if you have to deal with caching behavior that can appear to be leaks).  You may see an increase in memory usage in system components between the first measurement and the second measurement, this is usually due to caching and is normal.  If you see an increase between the second measurement and the third, there is probably a leak.  The last test run and measurement is just to help you spot trends in the leak.  Here is the sequence: run test scenario take memory measurement (use memsnap and poolsnap) (use DH here if you are trying to track specific leak) run test scenario take memory measurement (use memsnap and poolsnap) (use DH here if you are trying to track specific leak) run test scenario take memory measurement (use memsnap and poolsnap) (use DH here if you are trying to track specific leak) (run DHCMP to sort out the allocations) Long Duration testing model.  This model is designed to reveal resource problems encountered during extended use of your product.  This model has been used in the NT group to find many leaks and other memory related problems, and it is important because your products will be used over longer periods of time as they are adopted by large businesses.  Basically, you want to design tests to run over and over again for hours or days.  You should start by using existing tests, and making only the changes required to run the test without exiting your application.  For example, if I wanted to do a long duration test on MS-Word, I would take the word regression test and run it 50-100 times on the same instance of word, and take memory snapshots with memsnap.exe every 10th time, to see what was happening.  If I noticed that the commit charge was growing by 5 megabytes each time, I would then get a checked copy of Word (or use bounds checker or a similar tool) and run the test again to try and pinpoint where the leak is. This model is very important! People will start your application and leave it running for days if they can.  If you leak memory, you will cause performance to degrade not only in your application, but in the OS and in other applications, which reflects very badly on Microsoft. Repetition. A key aspect of leak detection is repetition.  If you do the same scenario over and over, and your memory usage goes up, then you have found a leak.  This can be as simple as running your app and pmon.exe at the same time, and watching your commit charge.  If you notice it go up, just re-do the last thing you did and see if it goes up again.  If it does, you have probably found a leak.  People have used this method to find leaks in many apps, including the new shell.  There was a leak caused by dropping down the listbox in explorer a while back, a very simple scenario, leaked 8k every time.  This is also a good way to catch leaking handles. System leak detection vs. Process leak detection. There is a distinction between system leaks and process leaks.  Many times we have seen apps from other vendors (as well as from the apps group) that had serious memory leaks.  These are usually pretty obvious, the process size increases as you use the app. On the other hand, there are leaks in system processes that are exposed by the application you are using.  For instance, if the spooler is not releasing memory after it prints a document, this shows up in the commit charge of the spooler.  You need to look for both system leaks and app leaks. Using memsnap, poolsnap, and having a good long duration test strategy will help reveal these things. Server Testing Testing for leaks on servers requires a slightly different approach to testing simple applications.  In the NT group, we are currently looking for leaks using the following method.  First, we run a batch file that uses memsnap.exe and poolsnap.exe to check the memory status every hour on print servers while they are running as targets for client printer stress.  Then every once in a while we copy those logs off the server and sort them using sortlog.exe, and look at the memory status for each process as the server runs.  When we detect leaks, either as increases in process commit charge or handle count, (which we have found in lsass.exe, spoolsv.exe, explorer.exe, services.exe, and winlogon.exe), we switch over to a checked server and enable stack trace databases for the leaking process. Then we run dh.exe on them after they boot, run the stress for a day or two, run dh.exe again, run dhcmp.exe on the logs, and see where the leaks are.  This is very effective, even though we were only looking for printer spooler leaks, we found very serious problems in several other components. It is critical that all groups that own components that run on servers test like this, the payoff is two-fold.  First, you will find the leaks in your server apps, which is critical if we are to provide a robust, never-need-to-reboot product to our customers. Second, you will help us track problems down in other parts of the OS, which is another thing that will boost our reliability. Outside of bad hardware, bad drivers, and other obvious  crashing  types of bugs, leaks are the 1 thing we can fix that will have a huge impact on our reliability. Increasing our reliability is crucial to having NT being perceived as  enterprise ready Another part of the server testing is running with PageHeap turned on.  Simpley turn this on for your server application and run with it for a few days (or weeks if possible) to look for heap corruption. Simply running your server apps  until they die  is a very good idea, this way you can learn what will most likely cause them to need a restart.  Your goal should be that they never need to be restarted, the goal is appliance-like stability, the thing should run until the power goes out! Testers: What tools are most effective for testers. Bounds Checker, pmon, memsnap/sortlog/poolsnap/memfilt/poolfilt, ntlog.dll. Developers: What tools are most effective for developers. Bounds Checker, ntdll.dll, DH/DHCMP, debugger extensions. Costs and Benefits: Costs:  The  costs are relatively minor.  The most important cost is time, you will have to use one of your best testers for this.  The person should have good observation skills, good operating system knowledge, and patience.  Another cost is equipment.  This is much less of a factor now that fast Pentiums are fairly cheap.  Fast systems are helpful, as is having at least 32 mb of memory and a large hard drive.  Many of these testing strategies require a checked build, and a fast machine lessens the impact of running these.  Test development costs can be negligible, this is a very good opportunity to leverage existing tests.  I used RATS test and Winstone 94 for most of my testing, mostly it is a matter of packaging them up in a suite and running them.  Batch files are ideal for this, anything beyond that (like a nice GUI, etc) is extraneous. Benefits: Your customers will not call you up and tell you they are out of memory.  The memory leaks in your component will not negate all the memory reduction work that has been going on lately. You will achieve appliance-like reliability, more and more large and small companies will adopt NT as their server software. The following information can be used to help ensure the integrity of memory use by drivers and other kernel components. If you have a driver or other kernel component, you should enable special pool for it s memory, and run long duration tests to help you find any instances of pool corruption. KERNEL POOL (information provided by Daniel Lovinger (danlo)) Kernel pool is to kernel components what malloc() and other memory allocators provide to usermode components. However, unlike usermode components which are kept in separate address spaces and cannot share memory, all kernel components share a single set of "pools" of allocable memory. In the simplest form, the kernel pool allocator takes each page (4k on x86, 8k on alpha) of a pool and considers it as a set of 32 byte pool blocks. As memory is allocated by kernel components, the allocator finds consecutive runs of pool blocks large enough to contain the request plus a small header (of information for the allocator) and returns them to the caller. Note: 32 byte pool blocks are an implementation detail of the current NT 5 allocator and are subject to change at any time. For instance, one reason 32 byte blocks are used currently is that this corresponds to the size of a cache line on current processors (a cache line is the unit of a memory cache - in multiprocessor configurations careful consideration of cache effects are often required). No kernel component should ever assume that even a single byte beyond the allocation requested is accessible in any way. In fact, special pool (described later) will catch many such errors. The !pool debugger extension shows how pool pages are allocated. Here is an example: kd> !pool ffa21b28  ffa21000 size:   c0 previous size:    0  (Allocated)  File (Protected)  ffa210c0 size:   20 previous size:   c0  (Free)         ffa210e0 size:   40 previous size:   20  (Allocated)  ReSe  ffa21120 size:   40 previous size:   40  (Allocated)  ReTa  ffa21160 size:   20 previous size:   40  (Free)       MmCa  ffa21180 size:   40 previous size:   20  (Allocated)  VadS  ffa211c0 size:  100 previous size:   40  (Free)       VadS  ffa212c0 size:   40 previous size:  100  (Allocated)  ReEv  ffa21300 size:  1a0 previous size:   40  (Free)       MmCa  ffa214a0 size:   40 previous size:  1a0  (Allocated)  FatN  ffa214e0 size:   60 previous size:   40  (Allocated)  FatE  ffa21540 size:  180 previous size:   60  (Free)       Irp  ffa216c0 size:  440 previous size:  180  (Allocated)  Npfs  ffa21b00 size:   20 previous size:  440  (Free)       Irp *ffa21b20 size:  140 previous size:   20  (Allocated) *Irp  ffa21c60 size:   e0 previous size:  140  (Allocated)  File (Protected)  ffa21d40 size:  280 previous size:   e0  (Allocated)  Thre (Protected)  ffa21fc0 size:   40 previous size:  280  (Allocated)  VadS Each allocation is given a pool tag,(shown at the right) by the caller, a four character unique stamp that should serve to track down the owner. These pool tags are listed in \nt\private\ntos\inc\pooltag.txt on an NT enlistment. With these tags, it is possible to track down pool leaks with the !poolused debugger extension or the poolmon tool from the mstools collection. Note: allocation sizes shown in !pool and elsewhere do not reflect the amount requested by the caller, only the actual size in a multiple of pool blocks. Since pool allocations are in close proximity, errors in one component - writing or reading beyond an allocation, perhaps an allocation already freed, and even perhaps freed by another component in error - can have impact on completely unrelated components. This is pool corruption, and is one of the hardest to find and unfortunately more common errors. SPECIAL POOL Special pool is a powerful mechanism that can catch a pool corrupter in action. Since pool is by design a shared area for all kernel components, what special pool does is fragment allocations in a way that causes erroneous access to trigger a page fault. These page faults then lead to the memory manager realizing that an invalid access was made, and it can bugcheck the system (code 50)  and show exactly where an error occurred. Special pool does this in (at least) these ways: every other page of special pool is invalid (cannot be touched without triggering a fatal page fault) each allocation is given its own valid page each allocation is placed against the end of the page as each allocation is freed, its page is made invalid for a period of time This attacks many of the common routes to pool corruption. Causing pool allocations to come out of special pool has to be done selectively since it uses up a lot of pages of kernel address space and unless a machine has a also has lot of RAM, not all pool allocations can be made from it. This selection is done by specifying pool tags or a specific allocation size. The persistent registry key to set is HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PoolTag DWORD (or  you can set it by using the  Kernel Special Pool Tag  selection in gflags.exe) after which the machine should be rebooted. If the registry key is set, though, it should be removed before running regular stress. Stress will manipulate this key in normal operation so we get good coverage, but it checks to see if it has been set explicitly first. The kernel variable this affects is nt!MmSpecialPoolTag, which can be successfully changed at runtime if nt!MmSpecialPoolTagRotate is also set to zero. Rotation of the MmSpecialPoolTag is done automatically under certain conditions, again insuring reasonable coverage in stress runs. Since pool tags for a component usually have a common prefix, this "pool tag" can include wildcard characters, ? or *, to match a set of pool tags. To match an allocation size instead, set this "pool tag" to a size expressed as a multiple of pool blocks (for instance, an allocation of 0x37 bytes would occupy two 0x20 byte pool blocks, or 0x40 bytes). Note: DWORDs on NT systems are little endian (the least significant byte occupies the lowest byte address). To construct the DWORD for the pool tag "FatI", convert each character to its ASCII hexadecimal equivalent - 0x46 (F) 0x61 (a) 0x74 (t) 0x49 (I) - and put the first character in the lowest byte, second in the next, etc. So "FatI" == DWORD 0x49746146.

It proceeds by monitoring a resource use of interest during a test variation (or run) and then repeating that variation while causing each of the resource uses detected to fail, one per repeat of the variation.

Additional changes to the specifications will be necessary in adapting Direct3D to the XBox platform.  These changes will primarily entail a removal of features unsupported by the platform (windowed mode for example) but will also include new features supported by the hardware that we wish to expose.  Some of these new features will be provided as Direct3D extensions approved by the DirectX team, while others may be exposed in a separate library.  Although these specifications are in flux (especially in the areas of syntax), they still provide a sufficient foundation on which to begin test development. Tools needed Performance: DTrace Custom benchmarks Code coverage: ICECap Static analysis: PREfix PC-Lint Typo.pl Leak: Automated testing Corruption: Windows 2000 Driver Verifier Injector Automated testing Hardware needed Test development has begun using the standard PC SDK development machine (Intel PIII 800 Mhz, 128M RAM, ASUS 6800 32M AGP/DDR) as a reference platform.  As XBox prototype hardware becomes available (especially NV-20 and NV-25 cards from NVIDIA) it will be used for testing the driver, extensions, and performance.  NTSC, PAL, and HDTV televisions will also be required for display mode testing. Direct3D support on XBox From the perspective of an application, Direct3D on XBox should match its counterpart on the desktop as closely as possible.  However, due to certain restrictions in system and hardware support, and in the interest of code size and performance, not all features of Direct3D will appear on the XBox.  The following is a list of differences between the XBox and desktop in Direct3D and related areas.  Since the XBox will support the majority of features contained in Direct3D 8, the list is mostly limited to what we will not support. Only the HAL device will be supported (no software emulation or reference rasterizer).  Software vertex processing may not be supported either. No legacy Direct3D interfaces or methods will be supported, including D3D_OVERLOADS. No windowed mode -- all applications will run full-screen.  Only the implicit swap chain owned by the device will be exposed. With UMA memory, the only valid pool for resources will be non-local video memory.  Direct3D will not perform any resource management.  The device on the XBox can never become lost.  Resetting the device should have no effect on currently allocated resources (other than the swap chain) and vice versa.  The system has no support for paging. No multithreaded rendering support. No GDI or User (so no device contexts, fonts, bitmap APIs, etc.). No registry support. The D3DX utility library may not be supported in its present form. Available display mode dimensions may be restricted (i.e. 640x480 only).  Video output will include NTSC, PAL, and HDTV.  No support for stereo displays or multiple monitors. The mouse cursor API will not be supported. No COM support (CoCreateInstance cannot be used to create a Direct3D object) N patches will not be supported by the hardware. Edge antialiasing will not be supported. Shader debugging support will depend on support for software vertex processing and support in the NV-2x. Shader tuning can be performed since the XBox is a closed system.  Instruction timing should be well documented.  DirectShow will not be supported.  A custom method will be provided for streaming video to textures. Test methods Focus The goal of testing Direct3D on XBox is to ensure the following: Compatibility at the API level with Direct3D 8.0 on the desktop (where possible). Functional correctness as compared to the desktop.  (Tests will generally assume that the reference device on the desktop generates correct video output). Stability for well-behaved applications (no crashes, no memory leaks, etc.). Speed approaching that which can be achieved by writing directly to the metal.  Direct3D should be as thin a layer as possible between the application and the hardware, with minimal performance overhead. Small in size.  All code not directly related to the NVIDIA hardware and the XBox OS must be removed (legacy versions of Direct3D, multiple adapters, multiple devices, windowed mode, etc.). Ease of development.  Development-time error checking should be correctly performed on debug builds.  If vertex and/or pixel shader debugging is available it should work well with our tools.  Extensions for NVIDIA-specific features should closely map to those features while still conforming to the style of Direct3D. Successful integration with the XBox OS and XAPIs/XTL.  Functionality, stability, and speed must be maintained when simultaneously rendering, mixing sound buffers, pounding on joysticks, sending packets across the network, etc. Test code Two primary resources are available from which existing Direct3D tests can be taken and adapted.   The first source for tests is from the DirectX test team itself.  These tests have the benefit of being current for DirectX 8 and providing a good level of code coverage.  Test suites for the Direct3D utility library should prove especially useful.  However, these tests are targeted at a PC environment with PC resources.   The major obstacles to adapting Direct3D 8 tests developed for the PC are a reliance of these tests on the reference rasterizer for verification and the use of multiple processes in their Direct3D test framework.  Another challenge may lie in finding an efficient means of remaining in sync with these tests as they evolve.  Investigation of the feasibility of porting these tests is currently underway. Another useful set of tests comes from Direct3D for Dreamcast.  These tests have the advantage of being targeted at a console platform.  They do not require the reference rasterizer to be present on the test system and better take into account the console environment (focus on limited memory, test NTSC and PAL television displays, etc.).  Although they were written to use Windows CE, it should be fairly straightforward to port them.  The two main drawbacks of these tests are that they target version 6 of Direct3D (the version released for Dreamcast) and they include some features specific to the PowerVR chip (i.e. bump mapping is performed using perturbed normal maps rather than UV delta maps).  The work in porting these tests will concentrate on expanding them to include DirectX 8 functionality and adapting them to the NVIDIA chipset. Once all useful tests have been ported, their coverage of Direct3D on the XBox platform will be evaluated.  All exposed areas that remain will be addressed by new test development.  This will include all new extensions written specifically for our platform. As much test code as is meaningful, whether adapted from existing tests or developed from scratch, will be structured in such a way as to allow it to be easily migrated across multiple test scenarios.  Test modules will be built as libraries that can either be linked into the common OS test team harness in serial or stress modes taking full advantage of the logging engine, or be linked into separate executables that can be provided to a developer without access to the harness for bug reproduction.  In the latter case, logging output may be directed to the debugger, a file, the screen, or all of the above.  In generating output, tests will at the very least make use of the pass, fail, warn, block, exception, and info logging levels to detail their status.  The data generated by the tests during a run will generally fall into four categories: the results of individual method and function calls; the verification results of frame buffer composition in a test as compared to frame buffer composition on a reference platform; performance data; and system status detailing such things as memory usage. Manual tests Although some tests will allow changes the view and device states using the joystick, no tests are currently planned that will require manual interaction. Configuration tests Configurations in the graphics area will be restricted to video output devices.  Currently, these include NTSC, PAL, HDTV, and potentially VGA.  Display mode, swap chain, and FSAA tests will cover these devices. Code reviews Code reviews will be conducted after major check-ins and when release candidates are declared.  Reviews will typically involve the tester, the developer, the test lead, and the PM. Debug walkthrough  Debug walkthroughs will be useful in analyzing code for performance, identifying superfluous code from the desktop not relevant to our platform, and gauging test coverage. Security Direct3D should have no direct security implications. Performance testing All tests will support general performance measurements (frame rate, etc.).  In addition, a number of custom performance benchmarks will be developed to gauge the performance of specific areas (throughput, fill rate, fixed function shading, HOP tessellation, multi-sampling, particles, state changes, function call overhead, etc.)  The specifics of these benchmarks are still to be determined, but the focus of them should be less on quantifying hardware capabilities and more on reducing the performance impact of using Direct3D (over going straight to the metal) as much as possible. Catastrophic failure testing Fault injection will be the primary means of catastrophic failure testing.  In the event of graphics driver and/or Direct3D run-time DLL corruption, the system recovery disk must be able to restore the files and return the system to a working state. Interfaces with other components Components that are to rely on Direct3D are TBD. Localization impact None.

working IDirect3D8 interface Incorrect or incompatible SDK version numbers will cause the method to return NULL CoCreateInstance Successfully returns a working IDirect3D8 interface IDirect3D8::Release Correctly frees all memory allocated for Direct3D Returns a reference count of zero Leaves the system in a state in which a new functional Direct3D8 object can be created Correctly cleans up even if the device and resource objects were not explicitly released by the application (even if the application is in the middle of rendering a scene on release all memory should be freed and the display hardware should be left in a functional state). This is a lower priority test since rarely will the method get called by shipping games (the user will generally just shut the machine off) but it will be important for developers debugging their applications and running them multiple times in succession. Adapter(s) Enumeration IDirect3D8::GetAdapterCount Always returns 1 (and only 1) Information IDirect3D8::GetDeviceIdentifier Correctly initializes the D3DADAPTER_IDENTIFIER8 structure on success Correctly sets the WHQLLevel member of the identifier structure to 0 when the D3DENUM_NO_WHQL_LEVEL flag is specified Fails when given any adapter ordinal other than 0, any flag other than D3DENUM_NO_WHQL_LEVEL (including the D3DENUM_HOST_ADAPTER flag), a NULL identifier pointer, or an identifier pointer to read-only memory. Returns the correct development-time error on failure Does not modify the D3DADAPTER_IDENTIFIER8 memory on failure Display modes Enumeration IDirect3D8::GetAdapterModeCount Correctly returns the number of display modes available (TBD).  This number should be a constant and never change. IDirect3D8::EnumAdapterModes Returns the correct display mode information for all supported native modes, including NTSC, PAL, and HDTV (modes TBD), and all unknown format combinations corresponding to the native modes.  Only supported modes are enumerated, supported modes are only enumerated once for each refresh rate, and no unsupported modes are enumerated.  Fails when given any adapter ordinal other than 0, a mode of D3DCURRENT_DISPLAY_MODE, a mode ordinal equal to or exceeding the number of supported modes, a NULL display mode pointer, or a display mode pointer to read-only memory. In all failure cases other than a NULL or read-only display mode pointer, the D3DDISPLAYMODE structure is zeroed out.  REVIEW: Is this true of all information retrieval methods? Current mode IDirect3D8::GetAdapterDisplayMode Returns the correct display mode information for the adapter s current display mode.  The correct information is returned both when the device is set to each of the supported modes on creation (IDirect3D8::CreateDevice) and on resize (IDirect3DDevice8::Resize).  TBD: What is the display mode of the adapter on boot-up (before any device has been created)?  Will that display mode be restored when the device is released? Fails when given any adapter ordinal other than 0, a NULL display mode pointer, or a display mode pointer to read-only memory. Does not modify the D3DDISPLAYMODE structure on failure caused by an invalid adapter ordinal. Setting IDirect3D8::CreateDevice All supported display modes are correctly set in the device on creation. Fails with [TBD] on unsupported modes. IDirect3DDevice8::Resize All supported display modes are correctly set in the device on resize (including resizing into the current mode). Fails with [TBD] on unsupported modes. REVIEW: Potentially fails when any outstanding references to the swap chain or depth buffers are present (i.e. buffer interfaces obtained from IDirect3DDevice8::GetBackBuffer, IDirect3DDevice8::GetDepthStencilSurface, IDirect3DDevice8::GetRenderTarget, and IDirect3DDevice8::GetSwapChain methods).  If Resize does not fail then new buffer objects are created and existing objects are decremented (being released once the application releases them). REVIEW: Implications of performing a Resize when the device is still drawing or when one of the swap chain or depth buffers is being used as the destination in a copy operation that has not completed. Unknown formats The correct display modes (TBD) are set for each of the unknown format types, both on device creation and resize. Refresh rates The refresh rates for all supported display modes are correctly set in the device on creation and resize.  The refresh rate is verified by counting v-blanks per second using IDirect3DDevice8::GetRasterStatus. Dimensions and format of swap chain buffers The dimensions and format of all buffers in the swap chain correctly correspond to the display mode into which the device has been placed, both when the device is created and when it is resized, for all supported display modes. The dimensions of all buffers in the swap chain correctly reflect both the current display mode and the current multi-sampling set in the device, both when the device is created and when it is resized, for all supported display modes and multi-sample types. The formats of swap chain buffers are restricted to the following in DX8: D3DFMT_X1R5G5B5, D3DFMT_R5G5B5, D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8, and D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8. When a device is resized from one display mode to another, the correct amount of memory is allocated or released for the dimension and format change in buffers and the number of buffers in the swap chain. When a device is resized from one multi-sample type to another, the correct amount of memory is allocated or released for the multi-sample change in buffers and the number of buffers in the swap chain. Dimensions of depth/stencil buffer The dimensions of an implicitly created (auto) depth/stencil buffer correctly correspond to the dimensions of the display mode into which the device has been placed, both when the device is created and when it is resized, for all supported display modes. The dimensions of an implicitly created depth/stencil buffer correctly reflects both the current display mode and the current multi-sampling set in the device, both when the device is created and when it is resized, for all supported display modes and multi-sample types. When a device is resized from one display mode to another, the correct amount of memory is allocated or released for the dimensions and format change in depth/stencil buffers (including changing from having an implicit depth buffer to not having one and vice-versa). When a device is resized from one multi-sample type to another, the correct amount of memory is allocated or released for the multi-sample change in depth/stencil buffers. Implicit texture formats If certain texture formats are supported in some display modes and not in others and if those texture formats can be the default in unknown format selections, verify that they are not selected when an unknown texture format is specified and the current display mode does not support the format. Frame buffer Enumeration Supported render target formats IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceFormats Succeeds with D3DFMT_X1R5G5B5, D3DFMT_R5G5B5, D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8, and D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 formats when checked against all supported display mode formats (and D3DFMT_UNKNOWN) with the D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET usage.  Fails for all other render target formats. Fails when given any adapter ordinal other than 0 and any device type other than D3DDEVTYPE_HAL. Implicit swap chains Single back buffer Multiple back buffers If the maximum number of back buffers in a device is limited by hardware (or DX8 itself), IDirect3D8::CreateDevice and IDirect3DDevice8::Resize should succeed for all back buffer counts up to the maximum.  For any counts that exceed the maximum, the methods should fail but modify the BackBufferCount member of D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS to equal the maximum. Unless a hardware or DX8 limit is placed on the maximum number of back buffers in a device, the back buffer count is constrained only by available memory.  After attempting (and failing) to create or resize a device with 0xFFFFFFFF back buffers, the BackBufferCount member of the presentation parameters structure should be set to the maximum number of back buffers that can fit in available memory.  The device should be successfully created with as many back buffers as memory allows and should correctly swap them for each of the supported effects. Repeated changes to back buffer count Direct3DSwapChain8 interface testing of implicit chain (assuming the interface is supported for the implicit chain) IDirect3DDevice8::GetSwapChain Correctly returns a swap chain interface corresponding to the implicit swap chain in the device. Should return E_NOTIMPL (or D3DERR_x equivalent) if the interface is removed IDirect3DSwapChain8::Present Behaves identically to IDirect3DDevice8::Present.  All cases of success or failure apply to this method as they would to the device method. IDirect3DSwapChain8::GetBackBuffer Behaves identically to IDirect3DDevice8::GetBackBuffer.  All cases of success or failure apply to this method as they would to the device method. Explicit swap chains Unsupported since windowed mode is unsupported and only one swap chain can be full screen at any given time on a single adapter IDirect3DDevice8::CreateAdditionalSwapChain should fail with E_NOTIMPL. Recommend the removal of the IDirect3DSwapChain8 interface altogether so any attempts to use swap chains will result in compile time errors (and code size may be reduced as well) Multi-sample swap chains Enumeration IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceMultisampleTypes Succeeds for D3DFMT_X1R5G5B5, D3DFMT_R5G5B5, D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8, and D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 formats (including D3DFMT_UNKNOWN) with the D3DMULTISAMPLE_16_SAMPLES multi-sample type.  Fails with D3DERR_INVALIDCALL for all other render target formats.  Potentially fails with D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE for all other multi-sample types (TBD). Fails with D3DERR_INVALIDCALL when given any adapter ordinal other than 0, TRUE for windowed mode, and any device type other than D3DDEVTYPE_HAL. Retrieving the back buffer IDirect3DDevice8::GetBackBuffer Returns the correct surface interface for each back buffer in the swap chain. Fails with E_INVALIDARG when given a back buffer index equal to or exceeding the number of back buffers in the swap chain, a NULL surface interface pointer, or a surface interface pointer located in read-only memory. Clears the back buffer interface pointer on failure from an invalid buffer index. REVIEW: Are we providing any support for stereo displays? REVIEW: How are swap chain buffers represented internally in a device?  Will GetBackBuffer yield an interface on a Direct3DSurface8 object for the back buffer requested?  How will reference counts be affected by the method?  Will the back buffer interface have a reference count of two?  If reference counts are affected, verify them. IDirect3DDevice8::GetRenderTarget Returns the correct surface interface for the first back buffer (ordinal 0) in the swap chain. Correctly increments the reference count of the first back buffer. Fails with E_INVALIDARG when given a NULL surface interface pointer or a surface interface pointer located in read-only memory. Retrieving contents of the front buffer (debug) IDirect3DDevice8::GetFrontBufferRectangle Succeeds for all render target formats and multi-sample types, performing the correct conversion from the target format to the A8R8G8B8 format of the image buffer. Creates an image buffer of the same dimensions as the source rectangle and with an A8R8G8B8 format.  The image buffer should have a reference count of 1. Fails when given a source rectangle with invalid dimensions (i.e. coordinates outside the dimensions of the front buffer, right or bottom coordinates less than left or top coordinates, etc.). Fails when given a NULL surface interface pointer or a surface interface pointer located in read-only memory. Swap effects Discard Causes the back buffer at the end of the swap chain to be filled with noise on debug builds after the Present method has been called. Succeeds for all supported multi-sample types. REVIEW: The presentation method is unknown for discard swaps.  Can it be assumed that multiple back buffers will be rotated serially (as with Flip) for this effect? REVIEW: The first operation on every pixel in the back buffer after Present must be write-only for discard swaps.  Is this rule enforced in any way?  If so it must be verified for things like destination alpha blends and stencil operations. Correctly causes a serial rotation of back buffers. Preserves contents of the front buffer after presentation (the back buffer with the highest index contains the data). Synchronizes with v-blanks. Fails when used in presentation parameters where MultiSampleType has been set to any other value than D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE. Preserves the contents of the back buffer after presentation (the contents of the back buffer and the front buffer will be identical after presentation). Not necessarily synchronized with a v-blank, image tearing can result. Fails when attempted with multiple back buffers (BackBufferCount > 1). Fails when used in presentation parameters where MultiSampleType has been set to any other value than D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE. Copy with VSync Behaves identically to the copy swap effect with one exception: presentation is synchronized with the v-blank. Presentation intervals Enumeration All supported intervals are masked together in the PresentationIntervals member of D3DCAPS8. Setting All supported intervals yield a correct frame rate for all supported display mode refresh rates (i.e. a refresh rate of 60 Hz and a presentation interval of four would give a frame rate of 15 fps). Immediate presentation intervals yield frame rates exceeding refresh rates for swap effects that do not wait for v-blanks (copy).  Gamma correction IDirect3DDevice8::SetGammaRamp Correctly sets the red, green, and blue gamma ramps in the device. REVIEW: Do we have support for a gamma calibrator? If a calibrator is not installed, both calibration flags have the same effect on the gamma ramps in the device. REVIEW: If a calibrator is installed, D3DSGR_CALIBRATE will modify the given ramps.  Will these modifications be reflected in the ramps retrieved by GetGammaRamp or will retrieved ramps always be identical to what has been set? Fails when given a NULL gamma ramp pointer. IDirect3DDevice8::GetGammaRamp Correctly retrieves the red, green, and blue gamma ramps set in the device by SetGammaRamp. Correctly retrieves the gamma ramps initially set in the device on creation. Depth/stencil buffer Enumeration Supported depth buffer formats IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceFormats Succeeds for all depth buffer formats when checked against all supported display mode formats (and D3DFMT_UNKNOWN) with the D3DUSAGE_DEPTHSTENCIL usage.  Fails for all other resource formats. Fails when given any adapter ordinal other than 0 and any device type other than D3DDEVTYPE_HAL. Implicit depth buffers Formats The format of an implicitly created depth/stencil buffer correctly matches the format specified in the presentation parameters, both when the device is created and when it is resized, for all supported depth buffer formats in all supported display mode formats. Explicit depth buffers Surface resources IDirect3DDevice8::CreateDepthStencilSurface Succeeds in creating depth/stencil buffer surfaces in all depth buffer formats. REVIEW: The method includes a usage parameter and expects it to be set to D3DUSAGE_DEPTHSTENCIL.  But it doesn t make much sense to call the method without specifying the DEPTHSTENCIL usage.  So why even have the usage parameter at all why it could be implicitly set within the method? Other resources If DX8 supports other depth/stencil buffer resources (i.e. cube map depth buffer for dynamic environment mapping) they will have to be tested for creation and setting as render targets (using their surface interfaces).  All surface interfaces of these resources need to be verified.  All depth formats of supported resources must be created and set in all display mode formats. Setting IDirect3DDevice8::SetRenderTarget Association: Succeeds in setting depth/stencil surfaces of all formats in all supported display mode formats. Succeeds in setting all surface interfaces of any other supported depth resources (i.e. cube maps) using all depth formats for the resource and all surface interfaces on the resource. For all supported render target resource types, fails to set each frame buffer that has not been created with the D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET usage.  Fails to set each depth/stencil buffer that has not been created with the D3DUSAGE_DEPTHSTENCIL usage. Fails for all supported render target types when given a depth/stencil buffer with dimensions smaller than the frame buffer.  Fails in cases of both new and existing (SetRenderTarget passed NULL) frame and depth buffers. Preserves depth/stencil buffer contents on disassociation. Preserves depth/stencil buffer contents on re-association when the dimensions and format of the frame buffer match those of the frame buffer present when the depth/stencil buffer was disassociated.  Increments the reference count of both color and depth/stencil buffers that are being set. Decrements the reference count of both color and depth/stencil buffers that are being replaced. REVIEW: When a frame buffer has been implicitly created as part of a swap chain and SetRenderTarget is used to switch to a texture for rendering, what happens to the frame buffer?  Does it get released?  How can the reference count of the swap chain be correctly incremented so this doesn t happen -- by getting one of the back buffers and incrementing it?  How is the swap chain then restored as the render target   through the back buffer? Retains the current frame buffer and/or depth buffer when NULL is given as the pointer for both/either of them. Memory: Releases both implicitly created and explicitly set depth/stencil buffers. IDirect3DDevice8::GetDepthStencilSurface Succeeds in returning correct depth buffer surface interface. Correctly increments the reference count of the interface. Fails when no depth buffer has been associated with the device and sets the surface interface pointer to NULL. No automatic depth/stencil buffering No memory allocation for a depth buffer. No buffer interface retrived by GetDepthStencilBuffer. Enabling depth and stencil buffering fails (D3DRS_ZENABLE, D3DRS_ZWRITEENABLE, D3DRS_STENCILENABLE) Creating and releasing depth buffers with Resize Correct allocation of the depth buffer when autodepthstencil is set to FALSE when the device is created and then set to TRUE on resize (verify both memory consumption and presence of depth buffer using GetDepthStencilSurface). Correct release of the depth buffer when autodepthstencil is set to TRUE when the device is created and then set to FALSE on resize (verify both memory deallocation and absence of depth buffer using GetDepthStencilSurface). Correct format of the depth buffer when Resize is used to change the buffer format. Correct update of D3DRS_ZENABLE, D3DRS_ZWRITEENABLE, and D3DRS_STENCILENABLE render states when a depth buffer is created or released during a Resize. Device Enumeration IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceTypes fails for all display mode formats when D3DDEVTYPE_SW and D3DDEVTYPE_REF device types are given. IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceFormats, IDirect3D8::CheckDeviceMultisampleTypes, and IDirect3D8::CreateDevice fail when given SW or REF device types. IDirect3D8::GetDeviceCaps should either fail or return a caps structure with no capabilities reported. Creation IDirect3D8::CreateDevice Fails for all device types other the D3DDEVTYPE_HAL. Fails when windowed mode has been set to TRUE (the same must happen on Resize) Fails when another device object is currently instantiated. REVIEW: support for software vertex processing? REVIEW: Will we support only a pure device? ISSUE: In some cases pure devices cannot be relied upon to correctly return information about the state of the device.  If this turns out to be the case for us then it will have a significant impact on the usage of the Get methods for verification in testing. REVIEW: Multithreaded device support? REVIEW: Will we have any support for driver management of resources? Release IDirect3DDevice8::Release Correctly frees all memory allocated for the device. Returns a reference count of zero. Leaves the system in a state in which a new functional device object can be created (with no state information from the previous device retained in the new device). Correctly cleans up even if any resource objects were not explicitly released by the application (even if the application is in the middle of rendering a scene on release all memory should be freed and the display hardware should be left in a functional state). FPU Precision Setup Should be set by default Preserve Information IDirect3D8::GetDeviceCaps dumpcaps tool IDirect3DDevice8::GetCaps IDirect3DDevice8::GetDirect3D IDirect3DDevice8::GetCreationParameters IDirect3DDevice8::GetInfo IDirect3DDevice8::GetAvailableTextureMem Should be somewhat synonymous with unified memory available but how reliable will it be in our case? Lost devices The device will never become lost on the XBox platform.  All code dealing with the loss and restoration of devices should be removed. IDirect3DDevice8::TestCooperativeLevel should be a one line method: return D3D_OK. Resources Resources Private data Priorities Unsupported since we won t be supporting any form of resource management.

Release criteria All tests should pass in order to sign off on a release candidate.  If a shipping build is being considered for a specific title, all tests covering the features used by the title must pass.  The only failure cases acceptable in a release are those whose repro steps are declared too obscure to be hit by ISVs, a determination made by triage on a case-by-case basis.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Internal Logging Specification TitleLogging Specification Steven Kehrli Normal.dot Steven Kehrli Microsoft Word 9.0zY_NF {zOsHU :CFQPHLogging Specification Author Steven Kehrli (steveke) Revision History 03/09/2000: Initial Spec 03/10/2000 Added Test DLL Dependencies section to detail Thread Local Storage (TLS) requirements. 03/16/2000 Removed Test DLL Dependencies section re. TLS requirements.  xlog.dll does this now. Clarified ANSI vs UNICODE. 04/06/2000: Added SetComponent() and SetFunctionName() APIs. 05/08/2000: Added hLog handle to xSetComponent() and xSetFunctionName() APIs. 05/17/2000: Added support for nested variations. Added support for logging outside of a variation. 06/16/2000: Added XLL_VARIATION_START and XLL_VARIATION_END. 08/10/2000: Added remote console functionality through a socket. Revised web post functionality. Added xLogResourceStatus() and xChangeLog() APIs. Removed the API Design section. User Experience Harness call xCreateLog(): Creates the log object. Sets the default logging level for this log object. Returns a handle to the log object. Harness calls Test DLL entry point, StartTest().  StartTest() takes one parameter, the handle to the log object. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level.  Component, subcomponent, function name, and variation name are defaulted. If specified log level is not XLL_INFO, XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, or XLL_VARIATION, increments the total number of variations and the appropriate variation result counter.  XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, and XLL_VARIATION should never be passed to xLog().  They are for use with xCreateLog() and for internal use of the logging engine. Test DLL calls xSetComponent(): Sets the component and subcomponent for the logging sequences. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level.  Function name and variation name are defaulted. If specified log level is not XLL_INFO, XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, or XLL_VARIATION, increments the total number of variations and the appropriate variation counter (i.e. XLL_BLOCK increments variations blocked).  XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, and XLL_VARIATION should never be passed to xLog().  They are for use with xCreateLog() and for internal use of the logging engine. Test DLL calls xSetFunctionName(): Sets the function name for the logging sequences. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level.  Variation name is defaulted. If specified log level is not XLL_INFO, XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, or XLL_VARIATION, increments the total number of variations and the appropriate variation counter (i.e. XLL_BLOCK increments variations blocked).  XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, and XLL_VARIATION should never be passed to xLog().  They are for use with xCreateLog() and for internal use of the logging engine. Test DLL calls xStartVariation(): Starts a variation logging sequence for this thread. Increments the total number of variations. Logs a string, i.e. variation name, indicating the Test DLL has started a variation. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level. Test DLL calls xStartVariation(): Starts a variation logging sequence for this thread. Increments the total number of variations. Logs a string, i.e. variation name, indicating the Test DLL has started a variation. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level. Test DLL calls xEndVariation(): Ends a variation logging sequence for this thread. Increments the appropriate variation result counter. Logs a string indicating the Test DLL has ended a variation. Test DLL calls xEndVariation(): Ends a variation logging sequence for this thread. Increments the appropriate variation result counter. Logs a string indicating the Test DLL has ended a variation. Test DLL calls xLog(): Logs a string at a specified log level.  Variation name is defaulted. If specified log level is not XLL_INFO, XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, or XLL_VARIATION, increments the total number of variations and the appropriate variation counter (i.e. XLL_BLOCK increments variations blocked).  XLL_VARIATION_START, XLL_VARIATION_END, and XLL_VARIATION should never be passed to xLog().  They are for use with xCreateLog() and for internal use of the logging engine. Harness calls xCloseLog(): Logs the results. Closes the log file.  Log File Output The log file will be a csv file. For each log string there are 8 columns: Thread Id   4 chars Time   8 chars (HH:MM:SS) Log Level   25 chars Component   32 chars Subcomponent   32 chars Function Name   32 chars Variation Name   32 chars Log String   255 chars The following code: xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Info: No component, subcomponent, function name, or variation"); xLog(hLog, XLL_BLOCK, "Block: No component, subcomponent, function name, or variation"); xSetComponent(hLog, "Component", "Subcomponent"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Info: No function name, or variation"); xLog(hLog, XLL_BLOCK, "Block: No function name, or variation"); xSetFunctionName(hLog, "FunctionName"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Info: No variation"); xLog(hLog, XLL_BLOCK, "Block: No variation"); xStartVariation(hLog, "Variation Level 1"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Meaningless info, Level 1"); xStartVariation(hLog, "Variation Level 2"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Meaningless info, Level 2"); xStartVariation(hLog, "Variation Level 3"); xLog(hLog, XLL_FAIL, "Meaningless fail, Level 3"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Meaningless info, Level 3"); xEndVariation(hLog); xLog(hLog, XLL_PASS, "Meaningless pass, Level 2"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "More meaningless info, Level 2"); xEndVariation(hLog); xLog(hLog, XLL_FAIL, "Meaningless fail, Level 1"); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "More meaningless info, Level 1"); xEndVariation(hLog); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Info: No variation"); xLog(hLog, XLL_BLOCK, "Block: No variation"); xSetComponent(hLog, NULL, NULL); xLog(hLog, XLL_INFO, "Info: No function name, or variation"); xLog(hLog, XLL_BLOCK, "Block: No function name, or variation"); will yield the following output: 042c,14:00:53,INFO,<No Component>,<No Subcomponent>,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Info: No component  subcomponent  function name  or variation 042c,14:00:53,BLOCK,<No Component>,<No Subcomponent>,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Block: No component  subcomponent  function name  or variation 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Info: No function name  or variation 042c,14:00:53,BLOCK,Component,Subcomponent,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Block: No function name  or variation 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,<No Variation>,Info: No variation 042c,14:00:53,BLOCK,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,<No Variation>,Block: No variation 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION START,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 1,Variation Started: Variation Level 1 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 1,Meaningless info  Level 1 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION START,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 2,Variation Started: Variation Level 2 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 2,Meaningless info  Level 2 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION START,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 3,Variation Started: Variation Level 3 042c,14:00:53,FAIL,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 3,Meaningless fail  Level 3 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 3,Meaningless info  Level 3 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION END: FAIL,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 3,Variation Ended: Variation Level 3 042c,14:00:53,PASS,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 2,Meaningless pass  Level 2 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 2,More meaningless info  Level 2 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION END: PASS,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 2,Variation Ended: Variation Level 2 042c,14:00:53,FAIL,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 1,Meaningless fail  Level 1 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 1,More meaningless info  Level 1 042c,14:00:53,VARIATION END: FAIL,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,Variation Level 1,Variation Ended: Variation Level 1 042c,14:00:53,INFO,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,<No Variation>,Info: No variation 042c,14:00:53,BLOCK,Component,Subcomponent,FunctionName,<No Variation>,Block: No variation 042c,14:00:55,INFO,<No Component>,<No Subcomponent>,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Info: No function name  or variation 042c,14:00:55,BLOCK,<No Component>,<No Subcomponent>,<No Function>,<No Variation>,Block: No function name  or variation Results The results table will look like: Total Variations,8 Exceptions,0 Breaks,0 Failures,2 Warnings,0 Blocked,5 Passed,1 Unknown,0 System Configuration The system configuration may be written to the log file when it is created.

This document will cover basic networking functionality   namely testing of the broadband LAN adaptor, the narrowband USB-based modem interface, and the TCP/IP stack and related protocols.   This document will not cover  Online  components of the Xbox, such as modem dialup lists, Instant Messaging, or DirectPlay.  networking components for the Xbox consists of: Broadband: LAN Adaptor: (E100BNT5.SYS) The miniport driver NDIS 5.0: (NDIS.SYS) Wrapper for generic interfaces to the LAN adaptor TDI interface: (TDI.SYS)  (we might collapse this since it may not be needed) Narrowband: Modem Kernel support: (USBSER.SYS, MODEM.SYS, ASYNCMAC.SYS, WANARP.SYS, NDISWAN.SYS) kernel mode modem support Modem User support: (TAPI.DLL, TAPISRV.DLL, KMDDSP.TSP, NDSITAPI.SYS, RASMAN.DLL [PPP protocol], RASAPI.DLL) user mode modem support TCP/IP Stack and Protocols:  TCP/IP stack (TCPIP.SYS) Support for TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, ICMP (ping), IGMP (multicast) protocols Winsock2 Kernel: (AFD.SYS) Kernel mode Winsock. Winsock2 User: (WS2_32.DLL, WS2HELP.DLL, WSOCK32.DLL, MSAFD.DLL WSHTCPIP.DLL) User mode Winsock. DHCP client: (DHCPCSVC.DLL) For receiving IP addresses assignments from a DHCP server DNS client: (DNSRSLVR.DLL) For resolving   HYPERLINK "http://www.foo.com"  www.foo.com  to get it s IP address Web/WININET interfaces (WININET, URLMON, SCHANNEL? CRYPT32, SECURE32)? Remote NDIS: (RNDIS.SYS) ?? All components will be tested using  Functional  and  Stress  conditions using the same common harness used by other members of the Xbox OS Test Team. Here is the original schedule of the Xbox OS, relating to networking, dated Feb 28, 2000. Here is the current schedule of the Xbox OS, relating to networking, dated ??? ??, 2001. s the list of tools used by the Windows 2000 team to test various areas: TCP/IP, UDP, kelken, sandeep, ARP, ICMP, IGMP, kelken, sandeep, Ndis, timothyw, JamesB, HAPI (convert to vbscript) EB100t.sys timothyw, JamesB, HAPI (convert to vbscript) timothyw, vbscript TAPI, timothyw, vbscript Winsock DavidCat, JoryP HAPI, C tools Dhcp Client Service ElenaAp UsbSer.sys, modem.sys JamesB Asyncmac, wanarp, ndiswan TonyLe Tapi/Rasman/RasApi SudheerD DNS Client Wininet Networking Scenarios  Possible Scenarios List These are the scenarios under which the Xbox connectivity will have to operate and be tested. Broadband/LAN: Cable Modem and DSL connections. Null LAN Cable (a direct-connect/crossover LAN connector) Isolated home LAN with no DHCP server Isolated home LAN with a DHCP server Up-linked LAN, the ISP provides only 1 static IP address to the home site Up-linked LAN, the ISP provides multiple static IP address to the home site Up-linked LAN, the ISP provides a DHCP server LAN with and without a firewall/proxy servers LAN with a Network Address Translator (NAT) (tbd) Plugging into a PC running Internet Connection Sharing?  Can multiple XBoxes connect via a USB hub and thus through the PC? (tbd) RNDIS (Remote NDIS)?  Narrowband/Modem: Will support PPP protocol (tbd) Will not support SLIP, or PPTP, or VPN. Modem will be a 56.6 Kbps modem, but often times connections are made at only 28.8 Kbps (or slower). Will have it s own custom UI for ISP/Dialup support.  Will not support Dialup Networking logon and MSN logon. (tbd) Will need to support multiple ISPs, or even the same ISP with multiple dialup numbers. Will not support proprietary logons such as AOL, others like Prodigy? Protocols and Services: The LAN controller will be Ethernet (maybe not if we need to support wireless??). Will support TCP/IP (v4) Will support UDP/IP Will support client-side DHCP for receiving dynamic IP addresses   Will support SSL (secure sockets) for online shopping or encrypting of password for logons to remote on-line services? (tbd) Will support Winsock (it s usermode)?   (tbd) Will support DNS name resolution (client side)? (tbd) Will not support ARP, RARP Will support ICMP/PING, IGMP (group/multicasting)? Will support NDIS. Will support the following proxies: HTTP, Secure HTTP (HTTPS), FTP  (will not support Socks proxy?) (tbd) Needs to support IPSec ???  (probably not, we don t care about refusing DenialOfService attacks to the console.) (tbd) Do we need to support 802.1p  (TCP/IP QoS, RSVP, RGMP) protocols?  Is there any issue of 10 Mbit vs 100 Mbit support for this? Wideband/LAN Testing Overview The test harness consists of a process that runs on the Xbox test machine that loads test DLLs.  The test DLLs are executed in threads managed by the test harness and the DLLs log results (to a text file stored on the Xbox, or through OutputDebugString() statements to be captured using NTSD, or to a network location).  Another tool is then used to summarize the log files and then automatically posts the results to a web page which tracks the build number the test was ran on and the pass/fail/investigate status of the results and a link to the log files containing the results. The tool used to parse the logged output will verify that the output data is of the correct version before coalescing the data into a summary report.  This will allow us to update our log output as needed, or even to create custom logging modules, if needed.  (do we need this?) Writing Your Tests The tests you create will be DLLs that run within the test harness engine.  Your DLLs will need to provide specific test functions, but common test tool functions (such as logging) will be contained in a global library, which your DLL must load and use.  To get started quickly there is a sample DLL you can use a template in the directory \Xbox\private\tools\<harness_name>\SampleDLL of the SLM enlistment on your dev machine. Functional  Tests A full functional test run of the entire IIS test suite will be ran against DataCenter to ensure general functionality. Lab Stress Lab stress will be run to ensure DataCenter survives heavy-loads to a sustained period of time without failure. Ship Criteria (based on Win2000 opinion) is to survive: Beta (March 15, 2000), 21 days of long haul RTM (June 30, 2000), 28 days of long haul There are 4 types of machines that need to survive long haul: Single big box (8 proc, 8 GB RAM) 4-node cluster (specific 4 node enabled machines) 2-node cluster (can be any 2 machines) Regular server-class box (single/dual proc with 512 KB RAM) Office Stress Nightly office stress, how many machines/cyberbricks are required?  50 machines per night with 92% pass rate? CPU Scale-Testing Previously, Windows 2000 supported scaling to 8 CPUs.  DataCenter will support 16 CPUs (possibly 32 CPUs by OEMs).  Tests will be performed to ensure IIS makes proper use of 8 CPU and 16 CPU configurations with the expectations that increased client load can be handled (assuming no hardware bottleneck such as network I/O or disk I/O) when moved from 8 CPU to 16 CPU configuration.  All CPUs should be pushed to 100% CPU usage. RAM Scale-Testing Previously, Windows 2000 supported up to 8 GB of RAM.  DataCenter will support 16 GB (possibly 32 GB) of RAM.  Tests will be performed to ensure IIS makes proper use of 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM configurations with the expectations that increased client load can be handled (assuming no hardware bottleneck such as network I/O or disk I/O) when moved from 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM.   IIS should demonstrate that it benefits from increases in RAM because IIS will have access to a larger (in-memory) cache.    Note, we think we ll have an issue about IIS tsunami cache being restricted to a 4 GB max! Narrowband/Modem Testing Overview There will be 2 basics type of testing for this: Functional (aka  API level ) testing Stress testing Functional Testing To set up a PC-based Xbox, you should read Section 4.2 ( Setting Up Your Xbox Target Machine ) in the    HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\public\\idw\\xcomer.doc"  Xbox Newcomer Orientation  document. Briefly, these are the steps: Make your Xbox PC dual bootable with 2 partitions.  Put Windows98 on C: and  Win2000 Professional on D: Boot into Windows 2000 Professional and tweak some settings (MUST do this before installing the Xbox OS). Make a backup of the Windows 2000 Professional files. Modify your C:\BOOT.INI file so that your Windows 2000 Professional boot entry will appear as the Xbox boot entry (and enable /DEBUG). Boot into your Windows 98 partition. Copy the Xbox OS files to your Windows 2000 Professional installation directory/partition. Reboot your machine into the Xbox OS boot entry!  At this point you should have a machine that is Dual Bootable between  Windows 98  (C: drive) and  Xbox OS  (D: drive). Running Tests During  Step 6  (Section 4.2 of this document), you can also copy the test harness binaries and the test DLLs.  When your Xbox OS boots the test harness will automatically run.  When the harness runs it will load information from an .INI file which tells it which test DLLs should be loaded and executed.  Setting Up a Console-Based XBox To set up a Console-based Xbox    tbd.

Some of these tools need to be modified for Xbox Performance testing   we will have a special version of   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/performance/IceCAP/"  IceCAP  for Xbox from   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/"   to measure performance of memory manager. Code coverage   IceCAP will be used to measure the code coverage. The goal is to cover at least 80% of memory manager code. Special fault injection technique will be used to achieve this number Fault Injection   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/reliability/Injector/"  Injector  will be used to inject faults for some code paths that hard to cover Static analysis -  HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/reliability/prefix/" PREfix , TYPO.PL, and PC-Lint will be used regularly  Leak testing   this will be done through a combination of running the tests, measuring, and repeat. See  HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs\\leaks.doc" leaks.doc  for more information on leak testing. Corruption testing   this will be done using the driver verifier and fault injector Hardware needed For the beginning, a regular PC will be enough. After that we will need real Xbox machine to measure real performance. We also need at least 3-5 target machines in lab to run long-haul stress for leak and corruption testing. Test methods Test code What needs to be written? Test specific to Win32 memory allocation/de-allocation APIs (VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree, HeapAlloc/HeapFree, LocalAlloc/GlobalAlloc, etc) Page protection (PAGE_GUARD, PAGE_READWRITE, etc) What can be borrowed/adapted? Under   HYPERLINK "\\\\Index1\\src\\newnt\\base\\testsrc\\kernel\\mm"  \\Index1\src\newnt\base\testsrc\kernel\mm , there are some tools we could use abuseval - guard page testing beta - multi-threaded memory manager APIs test glmem - global/local memory stress kmode\kernelapistest\driver - NT kernel mode Mm APIs stress test mapflag - virtual memory APIs test memfile - memory manager APIs (including file I/O) testing movecopy   simple memory move/copy/fill testing newapi.10a   various memory APIs test/stress race   race condition testing timings   performance testing topdown   section testing viralloc   virtual memory APIs testing virtex   VirtualQuery/VirtualProtect testing vmstress   stress test for virtual memory manager witness   virtual memory stress What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? Can your code go into a stress test? Manual tests Configuration tests There is no specific configuration for memory manager testing. Xbox ships with fix size 64MB RAM. Code reviews How often? We will do code review after a check-in for changed code and at least one time for all code before we ship. Which Dev/PM will attend? If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough  Watch all the tested code in the debugger, it will help to learn how things work and write better tests Security What impact on security does this feature have? How can this be used to break our security? There is no protection whatsoever in memory manager. Title could allocate page in memory, download and copy malicious code from DVD, and jump to run from there. This issue is beyond the scope of this test plan and will be address in certification plan How can this be improved to enhance our security? There is no way to do this without sacrificing performance of the box Performance testing Measures performance of memory allocation/de-allocation under various conditions like normal and low memory scenario Cache hit/miss under various memory conditions, number of threads accessing cache section Measures how pool/heap fragmentation affect performance of memory and cache manager How will you measure performance? IceCAP will be used, also if necessary we might have to write small tools to analyze performance data from log files Catastrophic failure testing We will use fault injection technique to simulate I/O error to make sure that cache manager works as expected under this error condition. Interfaces with other components File system and file cache   File system depends upon memory manager to help cache file stream data. Separated test plan for file system will address file cache testing. However underlying section object, used to implement file cache, will be tested to ensure the stability and quality of the file cache Threads stack   memory manager manages the stack frames allocated to all threads executing in the system. In Windows 2000, kernel stack size is three 4K pages and is not expandable. For Xbox, all threads run in kernel mode, we have to make sure that stack for XAPI threads is not limited by 12K, even through it won t be able to expand dynamically Localization impact There is no localization required for memory manager. Test variations Accessibility through memory manager APIs Allocate, reserve, and de-allocation virtual memory using virtual memory APIs (VirtualAlloc, VirtualFree, etc) Query and change page attributes of virtual memory using VirtualProtect, VirtualQuery, etc Allocate and free local memory using global/local memory APIs (GlobalAlloc, LocalAlloc, GlobalFree, LocalFree, etc) Create, allocate, and free heap using heap allocation/de-allocation APIs (HeapAlloc, HeapCreate, HeapFree, etc) Read/write to guard page for first and second time Mutual exclusion heaps access in multi-threaded environment Kernel pool allocation (ExAllocatePool, ExAllocatePoolWithTag, ExFreePool, ExFreePoolWithTag, etc.) MDL creation, driver allocation using Mm APIs Automated APIs test Good/bad parameter testing (badman) for all memory manager APIs Stress testing under normal and low memory condition to find memory leak and corruption Verifier and fault injection Accessibility through memory manager APIs under driver verifier enabled Automated APIs testing under driver verifier enabled Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for memory manager to be declared  test complete Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? All of them, if necessary, with exceptions agreed by war team Which failures can we live with on this feature? None, this is core feature How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When they all pass with exceptions as noted above Note: System Address Space Layout As of 4/27/2000, this is the system address space layout based on new memory manager code (mmx).

User Experience Machine1 calls NetsyncCreateServer().  This function starts the netsync server. Machine2 calls NetsyncEnumServers().  This function enumerates the available servers.  Each enumerated server is passed in a call to the NetsyncEnumCallback function specified in the function call. Machine2 calls NetsyncCreateClient().  This function creates the session client.  On the netsync server (Machine1), the session server is created. The session client (Machine2) may send messages to the session server (Machine1) or any other session client in the session (and vice versa), using NetsyncSendClientMessage(). The session client (Machine2) may receive client messages from the session server (Machine1) or any other session client in the session (and vice versa) using NetsyncReceiveClientMessage(). The session client (Machine2) may receive server messages from the netsync server (Machine1) using NetsyncReceiveServerMessage(). The session client (Machine2) may receive either type of message using NetsyncReceiveMessage(). Machine2 calls NetsyncCloseClient().  This function closes the session client. Machine1 calls NetsyncCloseServer().  This function stops all running sessions and the netsync server. NetsyncCreateServer( Starts the server.  This function is reference counted.  Each call to NetsyncCreateServer() must be matched by a call to NetsyncCloseServer(). Return Values If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.  If the function fails, the return value is zero.  To get extended error information, call GetLastError(). NetsyncCloseServer( Decrement the server reference count.  When the reference count reaches 0, the server is stopped. NetsyncRemoveClientFromSession(     IN HANDLE  hSessionObject,     IN HANDLE  hNetsyncObject,     IN u_long  ClientAddr Remove the specified client from the session. Parameters hSessionObject Handle to the session. hNetsyncObject Handle to the client object. ClientAddr Specifies the address of the client. NetsyncEnumServers(     IN DWORD                   dwSessionType,     IN LPVOID                  pSessionType,     IN PNETSYNC_ENUM_CALLBACK  pNetsyncEnumCallback,     IN LPVOID                  lpContext Enumerates the available servers. Parameters dwSessionType Specifies the session type.  It may be NETSYNC_SESSION_THREAD or NETSYNC_SESSION_CALLBACK.  See 3) Session Types for more information. pSessionType Pointer to the session information.  If dwSessionType is NETSYNC_SESSION_THREAD, pSessionType is treated as PNETSYNC_TYPE_THREAD.  If dwSessionType is NETSYNC_SESSION_CALLBACK, pSessionType is treated as PNETSYNC_TYPE_CALLBACK.  See 3) Session Types for more information. pNetsyncEnumCallback Pointer to a callback function: typedef BOOL (*PNETSYNC_ENUM_CALLBACK) (     IN u_long  ServerAddr,     IN BYTE    bySessionClientCount,     IN u_short nServerClientCount,     IN BYTE    bySessionCount,     IN LPVOID  lpContext Parameters ServerAddr Specifies the server address of the session. bySessionClientCount Specifies the number of clients in the session. nServerClientCount Specifies the number of clients on the server. bySessionCount Specifies the number of sessions on the server. lpContext Pointer to the context structure passed to NetsyncEnumServers. The callback function is called once for each enumerated session.  ServerAdd, bySessionClientCount, nServerClientCount, and bySessionCount will be specified. The callback function is also called once per second.  ServerAddr, bySessionClientCount, byServerClientCount, bySessionCount will be 0. The callback function should return TRUE to continue enumeration.  The callback function should return FALSE to stop enumeration. lpContext Pointer to a context buffer.  lpContext is passed to each call to pNetsyncEnumCallback. Return Values If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.  If the function fails, the return value is zero.  To get extended error information, call GetLastError(). NetsyncEnumCallback(     IN u_long  ServerAddr,     IN BYTE    bySessionClientCount,     IN u_short nServerClientCount,     IN BYTE    bySessionCount,     IN LPVOID  lpContext Generic enumeration callback function exposed by Netsync.  It returns the first session found. When using NetsyncEnumCallback, pass a pointer to a NETSYNC_ENUM_SETTINGS structure as lpContext during the NetsyncEnumServers() call: typedef struct _NETSYNC_ENUM_SETTINGS {     u_long  ServerAddr;     DWORD   dwTimeout; } NETSYNC_ENUM_SETTINGS, *PNETSYNC_ENUM_SETTINGS; Parameters ServerAddr Initialize to zero.  On return, it will specify the server address of the session, or 0 if no session was found. dwTimeout Specifies the enumeration timeout, in seconds.  A standard timeout would be 60 seconds. HANDLE NetsyncCreateClient(     IN  u_long   ServerAddr,     IN  DWORD    dwSessionType,     IN  LPVOID   pSessionType,     OUT u_short  *LowPort,     OUT u_short  *HighPort Creates a client and joins it to a session. Parameters ServerAddr Specifies the server address of the session. dwSessionType Specifies the session type.  It may be NETSYNC_SESSION_THREAD or NETSYNC_SESSION_CALLBACK.  See 3) Session Types for more information. pSessionType Pointer to the session information.  If dwSessionType is NETSYNC_SESSION_THREAD, pSessionType is treated as PNETSYNC_TYPE_THREAD.  If dwSessionType is NETSYNC_SESSION_CALLBACK, pSessionType is treated as PNETSYNC_TYPE_CALLBACK.  See 3) Session Types for more information. LowPort Pointer to a buffer to receive the low port reserved for the session. HighPort Pointer to a buffer to receive the high port reserved for the session.

This should be at least 1.  byMaxClientCount Specifies the maximum number of clients supported by a session.  This should be at least byMinClientCount; if not, it is silently set to byMinClientCount. lpszDllName_W Pointer to a null-terminated string (UNICODE) that specifies the DLL to run the session. lpszMainFunction_A Pointer to a null-terminated string (ANSI) that specifies the function name to handle each received message.  See NetsyncCallbackFunction. lpszStartFunction_A Pointer to a null-terminated string (ANSI) that specifies the function name to call when starting the session.  See NetsyncStartFunction. lpszStopFunction_A Pointer to a null-terminated string (ANSI) that specifies the function name to call when stoping the session.  See NetsyncStopFunction. NetsyncCallbackFunction NetsyncCallbackFunction(   IN HANDLE  hNetsyncObject,   IN u_long  FromAddr,   IN DWORD   dwMessageType,   IN DWORD   dwMessageSize,   IN char    *pMessage,   IN LPVOID  lpContext hNetsyncObject Handle to the client object.

NetsyncStopFunction NetsyncStopFunction(   IN HANDLE  hNetsyncObject,   IN LPVOID  lpContext hNetsyncObject Handle to the client object. lpContext Pointer to the context buffer returned by NetsyncStartFunction(). Remarks NetsyncStopFunction should free any resources used by the session, such as lpContext. Session Behavior When the server starts, it creates a server thread.  This server thread acts as a message pump, listening for enumeration and connection requests.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   A second machine broadcasts an enumeration request.  This request includes the desired session information.  If the server understands the session information (i.e. it can load the specified DLL and functions), it responds to the request.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   The second machine selects the desired server and sends the connect request.  The server creates the desired session, if necessary, and adds the client to the desired session.  When the session has the minimum number of clients, the server starts the session and responds to the client.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the session thread first calls the start function.  This function handles any initial setup of the session.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   If the session type is SESSION_THREAD, the session thread calls the thread function.  This function handles the session and returns when the session is complete.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the session thread then starts a receive message loop.  Each received message is passed to the message function.  This function returns FALSE when the session is complete.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the session thread calls the stop function.  This function handles any final teardown of the session.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   The session thread finally sends a message to each client in the session that the session has ended.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   The session thread ends and the client should close.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Messages A session is free to define its own messages.  However, a message should conform to the following structure: typedef struct _NETSYNC_GENERIC_MESSAGE {     DWORD  dwMessageId; } NETSYNC_GENERIC_MESSAGE, *PNETSYNC_GENERIC_MESSAGE; That is, the first DWORD of the message buffer is the message id. Each session should be aware of the following message ids: NETSYNC_MSG_STOPSESSION NETSYNC_MSG_ADDCLIENT NETSYNC_MSG_DELETECLIENT NETSYNC_MSG_DUPLICATECLIENT NETSYNC_MSG_STOPSESSION is sent from the server to each session indicating the server is stopping.  The session should exit as quickly as possible. NETSYNC_MSG_ADDCLIENT is sent to the session indicating a client joined the session. If the session type is SESSION_THREAD, this message will not occur. If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the client address is specified in the FromAddr parameter of the message function. NETSYNC_MSG_DELETECLIENT is sent to the session indicating a client left the session. If the session type is SESSION_THREAD, the client address is returned in the FromAddr parameter of the receive function. If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the client address is specified in the FromAddr parameter of the message function. NETSYNC_MSG_DELETECLIENT is sent to the session indicating a client left the session. If the session type is SESSION_THREAD, the client address is returned in the FromAddr parameter of the receive function. If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the client address is specified in the FromAddr parameter of the message function. NETSYNC_MSG_DUPLICATECLIENT is sent to the session indicating a client rejoined the session without first leaving the session. If the session type is SESSION_THREAD, this message will not occur. If the session type is SESSION_CALLBACK, the client address is specified in the FromAddr parameter of the message function. Each client should be aware of the following message ids: NETSYNC_MSG_STOPSESSION NETSYNC_MSG_STOPSESSION is sent from the session to each client indicating the session is stopping.

In the following sections I used the word  damaged  to refer to a disk that has a problem detected by our software.  The types of problems our software will detect have not been specified yet. Reformatting data partition (on disk or memory unit) if corruption is detected, we have to make sure this works. Spec reviews  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\coreos\\restore.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\coreos\restore.doc Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? No, we need more reliability info so that we can make sure that our non-data-recoverable approach is the right thing, since it is a bad customer experience. There are other open issues in the spec, it does not seem to be complete at this time. Also, we need to define things like exactly what type of damage will the corruption detector detect? Corrupt FATs? Cross-linked files? We need to know this so we can make sure we can simulate all of them. Tools needed A tool to corrupt disks/MUs so we can test the corruption detection system would be very helpful. If we cannot find one we can easily write it. A tool / driver to read Xdisk format from a PC would also be helpful. Hardware needed What do you need immediately? - Nothing. What will you need further on down the road? - Xboxes and Xbox dev boxes, and MUs. What lab requirements do you have? - Enough space to accommodate Xboxes for every locale / region. Test methods Test code Aside from the tools we will need to simulate corruption, we ll probably also need image comparison tools so we can look at the image created by a recovery disk and compare it to a factory-fresh disk   we should be able to find a tool that does this. And a tool to verify that a newly-formatted partition is correctly formatted would be nice. Manual tests What are all the variations? Update Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and good data partition. Downgrade Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and good data partition. Sidegrade Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and good data partition. Update Dashboard from recovery disk on Xbox with damaged Dashboard and good data partition. Downgrade Dashboard from recovery disk on Xbox with damaged Dashboard and good data partition. Sidegrade Dashboard from recovery disk on Xbox with damaged Dashboard and good data partition. Update Dashboard from recovery disk with damaged Dashboard and damaged data partition. Downgrade Dashboard from recovery disk with damaged Dashboard and damaged data partition. Sidegrade Dashboard from recovery disk with damaged Dashboard and damaged data partition. Update Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and damaged data partition. Downgrade Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and damaged data partition. Sidegrade Dashboard from recovery disk with good Dashboard and damaged data partition. In all above scenarios, make sure everything (titles, network, shell, ROM kernel, etc) still works correctly by running all tests. What tools / equipment do you need for your variations? A way to make this work and testing go faster would be nice Configuration tests We will have to do all of the above tests with various sized hard drives to make sure everything will work together, for example if the year 5 hard drive is 20gb or whatever (someone needs to specify what the largest size we ll ever support is), we have to make sure an original recovery disk will still correctly recover the machine   we can have no errors here, or we ll start having version nightmares similar to DLL hell. Code reviews This code needs to be completely reviewed by the developer, PM, and tester assigned to this feature. Debug walkthrough  Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security We need to make sure that the upgraded shell binaries are all correctly signed and that they boot.  In this respect they need to be checked like all other title binaries.  Performance testing This is not a performance critical item, although it should not take hideously long   that is up to usability, if they say it is too long then we will investigate. Catastrophic failure testing We need to make sure that the right thing happens when recovery fails. If the recovery disk detects an unrecoverable state, or preferably if the ROM detects this, we should tell the user this so that will quickly give up and exchange the unit rather than frustrating themselves for a long time with trying to get it going again. Interfaces with other components We need to ensure that any shell will work with any ROM kernel, the disks need to be forward and reverse compatible. We need to make sure that any shell will work with any recovered file system. We need to make sure that all upgrades can be down/side/up graded. Localization impact The recovery disks must recover to the language / region that the box was shipped as, so we need to make sure that the recovery disk can recover all languages, and that it does not change the region, install the incorrect shell, etc. Test variations The various permutations are enumerated above. They basically mean that we have to run all testing through each recovered configuration to make sure the box is exactly right   we cannot afford to have the boxes change in any way that will affect game functionality. All shell / Dashboard changes must have 0 impact on games, and the data recovery must work on all versions of hardware and software. So testing will basically go like this: Perform a recovery / upgrade as listed above. Run all of our tests on the machine. Do this on hardware that has a variety of disk sizes. If we have any other real variation on the boxes, other than disk size changes, we need to also take them into account. The tester who will be responsible for running these tests needs to build a matrix of the variations outlined in this document and run through all of them. We should also use a tool like  HYPERLINK "http://tactics/Default.asp" Tactics  to store the test cases and report the results to. We ll probably use a contractor for this testing after we have it all worked out, and it would be nice to already know all the test cases. Test complete criteria There is very little new test development that needs to happen. When all testing has been completed and we can t think of any other ways to test this Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? - When it passes all the tests. Which failures can we live with on this feature? - none really.   First, do no harm.

Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.

   This document describes how to build PPP sessions and encapsulate PPP
   packets over Ethernet.

Applicability

   This specification is intended to provide the facilities which are
   defined for PPP, such as the Link Control Protocol, Network-layer
   Control Protocols, authentication, and more.  These capabilities
   require a point-to-point relationship between the peers, and are not
   designed for the multi-point relationships which are available in
   Ethernet and other multi-access environments.

   This specification can be used by multiple hosts on a shared,
   Ethernet to open PPP sessions to multiple destinations via one or
   more bridging modems.  It is intended to be used with broadband
   remote access technologies that provide a bridged Ethernet topology,
   when access providers wish to maintain the session abstraction
   associated with PPP.

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


   This document describes the PPP Over Ethernet encapsulation that is
   being deployed by RedBack Networks, RouterWare, UUNET and others.

1. Introduction

   Modern access technologies are faced with several conflicting goals.
   It is desirable to connect multiple hosts at a remote site through
   the same customer premise access device.  It is also a goal to
   provide access control and billing functionality in a manner similar
   to dial-up services using PPP.  In many access technologies, the most
   cost effective method to attach multiple hosts to the customer
   premise access device, is via Ethernet.  In addition, it is desirable
   to keep the cost of this device as low as possible while requiring
   little or no configuration.

   PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) provides the ability to connect a network
   of hosts over a simple bridging access device to a remote Access
   Concentrator.  With this model, each host utilizes it's own PPP stack
   and the user is presented with a familiar user interface.  Access
   control, billing and type of service can be done on a per-user,
   rather than a per-site, basis.

   To provide a point-to-point connection over Ethernet, each PPP
   session must learn the Ethernet address of the remote peer, as well
   as establish a unique session identifier.  PPPoE includes a discovery
   protocol that provides this.

2. Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3. Protocol Overview

   PPPoE has two distinct stages.  There is a Discovery stage and a PPP
   Session stage.  When a Host wishes to initiate a PPPoE session, it
   must first perform Discovery to identify the Ethernet MAC address of
   the peer and establish a PPPoE SESSION_ID.  While PPP defines a
   peer-to-peer relationship, Discovery is inherently a client-server
   relationship.  In the Discovery process, a Host (the client)
   discovers an Access Concentrator (the server).  Based on the network
   topology, there may be more than one Access Concentrator that the
   Host can communicate with.  The Discovery stage allows the Host to
   discover all Access Concentrators and then select one.  When
   Discovery completes successfully, both the Host and the selected
   Access Concentrator have the information they will use to build their
   point-to-point connection over Ethernet.

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


   The Discovery stage remains stateless until a PPP session is
   established.  Once a PPP session is established, both the Host and
   the Access Concentrator MUST allocate the resources for a PPP virtual
   interface.

4. Payloads

   The following packet formats are defined here.  The payload contents
   will be defined in the Discovery and PPP sections.

   An Ethernet frame is as follows:

                                       1
                   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  |          (6 octets)           |
                  |                               |
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  |         SOURCE_ADDR           |
                  |          (6 octets)           |
                  |                               |
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  |    ETHER_TYPE  (2 octets)     |
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  ~                               ~
                  ~           payload             ~
                  ~                               ~
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  |           CHECKSUM            |
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The DESTINATION_ADDR field contains either a unicast Ethernet
   destination address, or the Ethernet broadcast address (0xffffffff).
   For Discovery packets, the value is either a unicast or broadcast
   address as defined in the Discovery section.  For PPP session
   traffic, this field MUST contain the peer's unicast address as
   determined from the Discovery stage.

   The SOURCE_ADDR field MUST contains the Ethernet MAC address of the
   source device.

   The ETHER_TYPE is set to either 0x8863 (Discovery Stage) or 0x8864
   (PPP Session Stage).

   The VER field is four bits and MUST be set to 0x1 for this version of
   the PPPoE specification.

   The TYPE field is four bits and MUST be set to 0x1 for this version
   of the PPPoE specification.

   The CODE field is eight bits and is defined below for the Discovery
   and PPP Session stages.

   The SESSION_ID field is sixteen bits.  It is an unsigned value in
   network byte order.  It's value is defined below for Discovery
   packets.  The value is fixed for a given PPP session and, in fact,
   defines a PPP session along with the Ethernet SOURCE_ADDR and
   DESTINATION_ADDR.  A value of 0xffff is reserved for future use and
   MUST NOT be used

   The LENGTH field is sixteen bits.  The value, in network byte order,
   indicates the length of the PPPoE payload.  It does not include the
   length of the Ethernet or PPPoE headers.

5. Discovery Stage

   There are four steps to the Discovery stage.  When it completes, both
   peers know the PPPoE SESSION_ID and the peer's Ethernet address,
   which together define the PPPoE session uniquely.  The steps consist
   of the Host broadcasting an Initiation packet, one or more Access
   Concentrators sending Offer packets, the Host sending a unicast
   Session Request packet and the selected Access Concentrator sending a
   Confirmation packet.  When the Host receives the Confirmation packet,
   it may proceed to the PPP Session Stage.  When the Access
   Concentrator sends the Confirmation packet, it may proceed to the PPP
   Session Stage.

   All Discovery Ethernet frames have the ETHER_TYPE field set to the
   value 0x8863.

   The PPPoE payload contains zero or more TAGs.  A TAG is a TLV (type-
   length-value) construct and is defined as follows:

                        1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          TAG_VALUE ...                                        ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   TAG_TYPE is a sixteen bit field in network byte order.  Appendix A
   contains a list of all TAG_TYPEs and their TAG_VALUEs.

   TAG_LENGTH is a sixteen bit field.  It is an unsigned number in
   network byte order, indicating the length in octets of the TAG_VALUE.

   If a discovery packet is received with a TAG of unknown TAG_TYPE, the
   TAG MUST be ignored unless otherwise specified in this document.
   This provides for backwards compatibility if/when new TAGs are added.
   If new mandatory TAGs are added, the version number will be
   incremented.

   Some example Discovery packets are shown in Appendix B.

5.1 The PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation (PADI) packet

   The Host sends the PADI packet with the DESTINATION_ADDR set to the
   broadcast address.  The CODE field is set to 0x09 and the SESSION_ID
   MUST be set to 0x0000.

   The PADI packet MUST contain exactly one TAG of TAG_TYPE Service-
   Name, indicating the service the Host is requesting, and any number
   of other TAG types.  An entire PADI packet (including the PPPoE
   header) MUST NOT exceed 1484 octets so as to leave sufficient room
   for a relay agent to add a Relay-Session-Id TAG.

5.2 The PPPoE Active Discovery Offer (PADO) packet

   When the Access Concentrator receives a PADI that it can serve, it
   replies by sending a PADO packet.  The DESTINATION_ADDR is the
   unicast address of the Host that sent the PADI.  The CODE field is
   set to 0x07 and the SESSION_ID MUST be set to 0x0000.








Mamakos, et. al.             Informational                      [Page 5]

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


   The PADO packet MUST contain one AC-Name TAG containing the Access
   Concentrator's name, a Service-Name TAG identical to the one in the
   PADI, and any number of other Service-Name TAGs indicating other
   services that the Access Concentrator offers.  If the Access
   Concentrator can not serve the PADI it MUST NOT respond with a PADO.

5.3 The PPPoE Active Discovery Request (PADR) packet

   Since the PADI was broadcast, the Host may receive more than one
   PADO.  The Host looks through the PADO packets it receives and
   chooses one.  The choice can be based on the AC-Name or the Services
   offered.  The Host then sends one PADR packet to the Access
   Concentrator that it has chosen.  The DESTINATION_ADDR field is set
   to the unicast Ethernet address of the Access Concentrator that sent
   the PADO.  The CODE field is set to 0x19 and the SESSION_ID MUST be
   set to 0x0000.

   The PADR packet MUST contain exactly one TAG of TAG_TYPE Service-
   Name, indicating the service the Host is requesting, and any number
   of other TAG types.

5.4 The PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation (PADS) packet

   When the Access Concentrator receives a PADR packet, it prepares to
   begin a PPP session.  It generates a unique SESSION_ID for the PPPoE
   session and replies to the Host with a PADS packet.  The
   DESTINATION_ADDR field is the unicast Ethernet address of the Host
   that sent the PADR.  The CODE field is set to 0x65 and the SESSION_ID
   MUST be set to the unique value generated for this PPPoE session.

   The PADS packet contains exactly one TAG of TAG_TYPE Service-Name,
   indicating the service under which Access Concentrator has accepted
   the PPPoE session, and any number of other TAG types.

   If the Access Concentrator does not like the Service-Name in the
   PADR, then it MUST reply with a PADS containing a TAG of TAG_TYPE
   Service-Name-Error (and any number of other TAG types).  In this case
   the SESSION_ID MUST be set to 0x0000.

5.5 The PPPoE Active Discovery Terminate (PADT) packet

   This packet may be sent anytime after a session is established to
   indicate that a PPPoE session has been terminated.  It may be sent by
   either the Host or the Access Concentrator.  The DESTINATION_ADDR
   field is a unicast Ethernet address, the CODE field is set to 0xa7
   and the SESSION_ID MUST be set to indicate which session is to be
   terminated.  No TAGs are required.




Mamakos, et. al.             Informational                      [Page 6]

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


   When a PADT is received, no further PPP traffic is allowed to be sent
   using that session.  Even normal PPP termination packets MUST NOT be
   sent after sending or receiving a PADT.  A PPP peer SHOULD use the
   PPP protocol itself to bring down a PPPoE session, but the PADT MAY
   be used when PPP can not be used.

6. PPP Session Stage

   Once the PPPoE session begins, PPP data is sent as in any other PPP
   encapsulation.  All Ethernet packets are unicast.  The ETHER_TYPE
   field is set to 0x8864.  The PPPoE CODE MUST be set to 0x00.  The
   SESSION_ID MUST NOT change for that PPPoE session and MUST be the
   value assigned in the Discovery stage.  The PPPoE payload contains a
   PPP frame.  The frame begins with the PPP Protocol-ID.

   An example packet is shown in Appendix B.

7. LCP Considerations

   The Magic Number LCP configuration option is RECOMMENDED, and the
   Protocol Field Compression (PFC) option is NOT RECOMMENDED.  An
   implementation MUST NOT request any of the following options, and
   MUST reject a request for such an option:

      Field Check Sequence (FCS) Alternatives,

      Address-and-Control-Field-Compression (ACFC),

      Asynchronous-Control-Character-Map (ACCM)

   The Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU) option MUST NOT be negotiated to a
   larger size than 1492.  Since Ethernet has a maximum payload size of
   1500 octets, the PPPoE header is 6 octets and the PPP Protocol ID is
   2 octets, the PPP MTU MUST NOT be greater than 1492.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Access Concentrator ocassionally send
   Echo-Request packets to the Host to determine the state of the
   session.  Otherwise, if the Host terminates a session without sending
   a Terminate-Request packet, the Access Concentrator will not be able
   to determine that the session has gone away.

   When LCP terminates, the Host and Access concentrator MUST stop using
   that PPPoE session.  If the Host wishes to start another PPP session,
   it MUST return to the PPPoE Discovery stage.

8. Other Considerations

   When a host does not receive a PADO packet within a specified amount
   of time, it SHOULD resend it's PADI packet and double the waiting
   period. This is repeated as many times as desired.  If the Host is
   waiting to receive a PADS packet, a similar timeout mechanism SHOULD
   be used, with the Host re-sending the PADR.  After a specified number
   of retries, the Host SHOULD then resend a PADI packet.

   The ETHER_TYPEs used in this document (0x8863 and 0x8864) have been
   assigned by the IEEE for use by PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE).  Use of
   these values and the PPPoE VER (version) field uniquely identify this
   protocol.

   UTF-8 [5] is used throughout this document instead of ASCII.  UTF-8
   supports the entire ASCII character set while allowing for
   international character sets as well.  See [5] for more details.

9. Security Considerations

   To help protect against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, the Access
   Concentrator can employ the AC-Cookie TAG.  The Access Concentrator
   SHOULD be able to uniquely regenerate the TAG_VALUE based on the PADR
   SOURCE_ADDR.  Using this, the Access Concentrator can ensure that the
   PADI SOURCE_ADDR is indeed reachable and can then limit concurrent
   sessions for that address.  What algorithm to use is not defined and
   left as an implementation detail.  An example is HMAC [3] over the
   Host MAC address using a key known only to the Access > Concentrator.
   While the AC-Cookie is useful against some DOS attacks, it can not
   protect against all DOS attacks and an Access Concentrator MAY employ
   other means to protect resources.

   While the AC-Cookie is useful against some DOS attacks, it can not
   protect against all DOS attacks and an Access Concentrator MAY employ
   other means to protect resources.

   Many Access Concentrators will not wish to offer information
   regarding what services they offer to an unauthenticated entity.  In
   that case the Access Concentrator should employ one of two policies.
   It SHOULD never refuse a request based on the Service-Name TAG, and
   always return the TAG_VALUE that was sent to it.  Or it SHOULD only
   accept requests with a Service-Name TAG with a zero TAG_LENGTH
   (indicating any service).  The former solution is RECOMMENDED.

Appendix A

   TAG_TYPES and TAG_VALUES

   0x0000 End-Of-List

      This TAG indicates that there are no further TAGs in the list. The
      TAG_LENGTH of this TAG MUST always be zero.  Use of this TAG is
      not required, but remains for backwards compatibility.

   0x0101 Service-Name

      This TAG indicates that a service name follows.  The TAG_VALUE is
      an UTF-8 string that is NOT NULL terminated. When the TAG_LENGTH
      is zero this TAG is used to indicate that any service is
      acceptable.  Examples of the use of the Service-Name TAG are to
      indicate an ISP name or a class or quality of service.

   0x0102 AC-Name

      This TAG indicates that a string follows which uniquely identifies
      this particular Access Concentrator unit from all others. It may
      be a combination of trademark, model, and serial id information,
      or simply an UTF-8 rendition of the MAC address of the box.  It is
      not NULL terminated.

   0x0103 Host-Uniq

      This TAG is used by a Host to uniquely associate an Access
      Concentrator response (PADO or PADS) to a particular Host request
      (PADI or PADR).  The TAG_VALUE is binary data of any value and
      length that the Host chooses.  It is not interpreted by the Access
      Concentrator.  The Host MAY include a Host-Uniq TAG in a PADI or
      PADR.  If the Access Concentrator receives this TAG, it MUST
      include the TAG unmodified in the associated PADO or PADS
      response.

   0x0104 AC-Cookie

      This TAG is used by the Access Concentrator to aid in protecting
      against denial of service attacks (see the Security Considerations
      section for an explanation of how this works).  The Access
      Concentrator MAY include this TAG in a PADO packet.  If a Host
      receives this TAG, it MUST return the TAG unmodified in the
      following PADR.  The TAG_VALUE is binary data of any value and
      length and is not interpreted by the Host.

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


   0x0105 Vendor-Specific

      This TAG is used to pass vendor proprietary information.  The
      first four octets of the TAG_VALUE contain the vendor id and the
      remainder is unspecified.  The high-order octet of the vendor id
      is 0 and the low-order 3 octets are the SMI Network Management
      Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor in network byte order, as
      defined in the Assigned Numbers RFC [4].

      Use of this TAG is NOT RECOMMENDED.  To ensure inter-operability,
      an implementation MAY silently ignore a Vendor-Specific TAG.

   0x0110 Relay-Session-Id

      This TAG MAY be added to any discovery packet by an intermediate
      agent that is relaying traffic.  The TAG_VALUE is opaque to both
      the Host and the Access Concentrator.  If either the Host or
      Access Concentrator receives this TAG they MUST include it
      unmodified in any discovery packet they send as a response.  All
      PADI packets MUST guarantee sufficient room for the addition of a
      Relay-Session-Id TAG with a TAG_VALUE length of 12 octets.

      A Relay-Session-Id TAG MUST NOT be added if the discovery packet
      already contains one.  In that case the intermediate agent SHOULD
      use the existing Relay-Session-Id TAG.  If it can not use the
      existing TAG or there is insufficient room to add a Relay-
      Session-Id TAG, then it SHOULD return a Generic-Error TAG to the
      sender.

   0x0201 Service-Name-Error

      This TAG (typically with a zero-length data section) indicates
      that for one reason or another, the requested Service-Name request
      could not be honored.

      If there is data, and the first octet of the data is nonzero, then
      it MUST be a printable UTF-8 string which explains why the request
      was denied.  This string MAY NOT be NULL terminated.

   0x0202 AC-System-Error

      This TAG indicates that the Access Concentrator experienced some
      error in performing the Host request.  (For example insufficient
      resources to create a virtual circuit.)  It MAY be included in
      PADS packets.

RFC 2516             Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet        February 1999


      If there is data, and the first octet of the data is nonzero, then
      it MUST be a printable UTF-8 string which explains the nature of
      the error.  This string MAY NOT be NULL terminated.

   0x0203 Generic-Error

      This TAG indicates an error.  It can be added to PADO, PADR or
      PADS packets when an unrecoverable error occurs and no other error
      TAG is appropriate.  If there is data then it MUST be an UTF-8
      string which explains the nature of the error.  This string MUST
      NOT be NULL terminated.

Also, Namespace considerations must be taken into account, since the namespace mechanism virtualizes paths to storage (  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\namespace.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\namespace.doc The hard drive is always there, the MU may or may not be there, and the size can be different.  The online storage space may or may not be connected, and the connection may not be very good, and may be at different speeds (DSL vs. Modem) and through different devices.  The XDisk is used for System Data, User Data, Cache, Title Data.  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\xdisk.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\xdisk.doc The MU is used for personal data, such as saved games and high scores, etc  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\xcard.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\xcard.doc There is no online storage spec yet, but I expect that it will be a lot like the XCard but online. The most important thing is making sure that data can be written to and reliably read from the device. Other important things to look at also include seeing what happens when a device is full, empty, damaged, restored, swapped etc. Also, making sure the API s used to access the storage devices conform to what programmers are used to using for this purpose   they should match the same-named Win32 API s as closely as possible. Error testing is also important   how can we tell if the XDisk is broken? What do we do if it is? Remember   millions of people who have never touched a PC will be using these things, they must be as predictable as a toaster.

Tools needed Perf  ll need to measure performance of these storage mediums. The test plan for each medium will cover this in more detail, but in general, the important things to know will be: Data rate Latency CPU / Memory utilization Code coverage We are talking with MSR about getting ICECap modified for us to use for Code Coverage analysis.  All code will get this. Static analysis All code will be statically analyzed with PC-Lint, Typo.pl, and PreFix.  Leak testing All code relating to storage will be checked for this. It will be done through a combination of running the tests / measuring / repeat. Look at leaks.doc (checked into   HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) for notes on the how s and why s of leak checking. corruption testing This will be done with the Driver Verifier (  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs Hardware needed What do you need immediately? As of 4/24 we have the SDK boxes and we have a USB reader to use for testing, we should be able to test these quite quickly. What will you need further on down the road? X-Boxes, and an Online thing when that becomes available. What lab requirements do you have? Aside from X-Boxes and XCards, we ll need servers to simulate the online part. We ll need XCards of every size, and we ll need some damaged ones to test with to make sure the OS does the right thing when a broken card is used. Test methods Test code What needs to be written? The test plans for the individual units will elaborate on this, but in general, API tests for all storage related API s, and programs / tests that simulate the expected use of the device will be needed for performance testing.  What can be borrowed / adapted? The test plans for the individual units will elaborate on this, but in general, there are some NT tests and tools that can be adapted for this. What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? We may need some type of server for the Online storage. We may need some USB test code for the MUs. The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. Can your code go into a stress test? All test code for storage should be readily adaptable for stress. What logging levels are you going to use? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. What other input / output is needed? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. How do you generate test data? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. Manual tests What are all the variations? The test plans for the individual units will elaborate on this. ll be using Tactics for this purpose (  HYPERLINK "http://tactics/default.asp"  http://tactics/default.asp What tools / equipment do you need for your variations? X-Boxes, MUs, Servers. Configuration tests What configurations are important to testing this feature? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. For all tests, one area to be especially watchful of is the namespaces. The Nature of this feature causes paths to be changed based on the title running at the time. This mechanism is a lightweight access-limiting mechanism designed to keep titles from mashing each other, and to make it easier for users to manage user and title data. Please review this spec carefully and make sure your tests take it into account. Code reviews How often? For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship. Which Dev / PM will attend? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. Debug walkthrough  This will be required for all storage code. Security What impact on security does this feature have? Storage is very important for security: Can software access storage that it is not allowed to? Can things being stored be modified inappropriately? Can Online data be eavesdropped or otherwise hacked? How can this be used to break our security? How can this be improved to enhance our security? Performance testing Should you measure performance in your test? Would your test be useful for performance testing? Tests designed to mimic real-world scenarios may be more useful for this than API tests. How will you measure performance? The test plans for the individual units will elaborate on this. Catastrophic failure testing How are you going to test failure of your feature? The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. What happens to the rest of the system should your feature fail? This is very important to storage: If the XDisk fails, the box is rendered inop. b.) If the XCard or the Online storage is failing / broken, the OS needs to behave in a predictable manner.  The test plans for the individual units will elaborate on this.  Interfaces with other components The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. Localization impact The names of files can be localized, all the API s will support Unicode and possible there will be ANSI version for some of these. API tests that use storage need to test both A and W version of the API. Test variations The test plans for the individual storage units will elaborate on this. Test complete criteria What needs to be done to say that 100% of the test development work is done? There need to be tests for all normal, failure, and edge cases for all the storage devices. All devices must be tested, including all the various sizes available, including minimum and maximum sized MUs, minimum to very large XDrives, and Online storage of varying sizes. Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? At first guess, all mainline cases, all failure cases, and most edge cases, the only exceptions agreed upon by a War Team or similar group. Which failures can we live with on this feature? Not many, these are core features. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When they all pass with exceptions as noted above.

These things must be working correctly for the saved games to function correctly, and testing them is covered in other test documents. This document will cover all the saved game features, and only talk about lower level system features when necessary. Another important issue is how all this works with identity. Directory paths to saved games are created from the pair (game ID, name). With this in mind, the basic set of scenarios will be: save game with game (use the APIs provided for this) vary usersame vary game ID vary media vary media states (full, etc) move / manage game with shell between all media types between xboxes using MUs and the web open game with game model on scenarios from items 1 and 2 verify all metadata and game data and user data was correctly manipulated. Verify scenarios specific to various media types  space, connections, data rates, errors, corruption, between boxes  space, errors, corruption, between boxes Xdisk - space, errors, corruption Spec reviews Owner: Marc Whitten Spec:   HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\save_games.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\save_games.doc Also, see:  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\XBox Identity Overview.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\XBox Identity Overview.doc  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\xbox_storage.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\xbox_storage.doc The spec looks fine for beginning to test this feature. Tools needed Perf   this is a low priority, if we get to it use the same tools we use for everything else code coverage - IceCap static analysis   lint, typo, prefix leak testing - verifier corruption testing - verifier important docs:  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs Hardware needed What do you need immediately? s that can run the xbox OS   we have these. What will you need further on down the road? Memory units and web servers that can handle saved games. What lab requirements do you have? Nothing special for this. Test methods Test code We will need to write test code that tests the saved game APIs, which are listed here: Disk / MU APIs (these are preliminary API s and subject to change!): XgetSaveDevices XgetSaveRoot XcreateSaveGame XenumerateFirstSaveGame XenumerateNextSaveGame XdeleteSaveGame XcopySaveGame Online APIs (these are preliminary API s and subject to change!): XonlineOpenStorage XOnlineCloseStorage XOnlineUploadGame XOnlineDownloadGame XOnlineEnumerateFirstSaveGame XOnlineEnumerateNextSaveGame XonlineDeleteSaveGame The normal things that go into xbox tests need to go into test for these APIs, for instance stress versions, test until resources exhausted, startup tests, etc. I am not going to explain how to test APIs here. Manual tests The manual tests for saved games are all done from the shell / default title. Since this is not the test plan for that component, I will outline the basic scenarios and let the shell team fill in the details. Basically: Move games to and from every media type Make sure everything moved correctly. Configuration tests The important configuration scenarios are: Different network media configurations, states, and error conditions Yanked during save/retrieve of data Router going up/down during save/retrieve Online server might disconnect the xbox client connection (slow xfer?) Online server might be too busy to accept/process the save/retrieve game request (error popup UI?) Expected byte length different then actual (less vs. more).  Might cause game to hang to wait for a completion signal that will never complete? Saving data that exceeds online quota limit.  UI for warning or popup before transmit happens? Retrieving data that exceeds available/free harddisk space. Can we have 2 saves happening simultaneously from 1 xbox (I think not   safe). Will we have 2 saves happening simultaneously from 2 different xboxes?   (yes! Possible)  Full, empty, corrupted, yanked during save Xdisk Full, empty, corrupted, power cycled during save Code reviews How often? ll need 1 code review for the initial checkin of the APIs. Which Dev / PM will attend? Everybody that has anything to do with these. Debug walkthrough  Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security What impact on security does this feature have? This is a major avenue of attack into the xbox. Data of all types can be saved, and this can include hostile code that can exploit any weaknesses we have in the code.  User might be able to hack  paths  of online saved files (via URL paths) How can this be used to break our security? I am most worried about buffer overruns, and somewhat worried about saved games being triggers for and backdoor code a title vendor may have slipped into their title either accidentally or on purpose. How can this be improved to enhance our security? We need to look at things like buffer overrun attacks, and be proactive in the code to make it hard to break. We also need to carefully examine the code for poor practices or methods that are exploitable and choose less vulnerable alternatives whenever possible. Performance testing Should you measure performance in your test? Sure, but it is not a big priority. Would your test be useful for performance testing? How will you measure performance? Take baseline measurements, and look for changes between builds that may indicate we are doing something that makes us slower. Net-based saves/retrieves, will we allow for HTTP  byte ranges , for completing partial transfers that are cancelled? Catastrophic failure testing How are you going to test failure of your feature? Simulate media / device failures Call-waiting phone/modem disconnect Simulate media / device corruption Remove various files and make sure that we correctly handle the error, alert the user, etc if we detect a problem with the saved game Interfaces with other components There will have to be extensive testing with the shell, this will be covered in the shell test plan. Localization impact We need to localize: Game names User nick names File names And make sure things work.  I see not real issues here since everything is Unicode.  Possible some display issues with the shell since they will have to interpret the names correctly given the language / region of the user. Test variations Disk / MU APIs (these are preliminary API s and subject to change!): XgetSaveDevices () XGetSaveRoot () XCreateSaveGame () XEnumerateFirstSaveGame () XEnumerateNextSaveGame () XDeleteSaveGame () XCopySaveGame () Test these APIs using all the standard API test techniques   good bad data, to exhaustion, stress, etc Online APIs (these are preliminary API s and subject to change!): XonlineOpenStorage XOnlineCloseStorage XOnlineUploadGame XOnlineDownloadGame XOnlineEnumerateFirstSaveGame XOnlineEnumerateNextSaveGame XonlineDeleteSaveGame Test these APIs using all the standard API test techniques   good bad data, to exhaustion, stress, etc Test complete criteria All API tests must be complete, to include stress. Code reviews must be completed, along with debug walkthroughs, etc. Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? All of these API s need to work correctly for titles that ship with them. Which failures can we live with on this feature? How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When the tests are complete and there are no outstanding approved bugs.

Recovery from successful attacks (see recovery spec   HYPERLINK "http://xbox/Specs/pm/CoreOS/restore.doc"  http://xbox/Specs/pm/CoreOS/restore.doc Detecting and not playing / executing invalid media. Ensuring during the certification process that the title is  clean All images must be scanned with a virus scanner to detect and virus code that may have been slipped into the title.

Code reviews This code needs to be completely reviewed by the developer, PM, and tester assigned to security. It should also be reviewed (or at least the spec reviewed) by and outside party, such as the NT security team. Security through Obscurity is NOT acceptable for the security code. Debug walkthrough  Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security This is the security Performance testing The decryption code for loading the kernel needs to be profiled, as well as the code in the loader that performs decryption. If it is unacceptably slow we need to know early on so we can modify our approach, select different algorithm, etc. Catastrophic failure testing How are you going to test failure of your feature? What happens to the rest of the system should your feature fail? Interfaces with other components How will these be tested? Localization impact The only real localization impact is the region codes on DVD s, we can t have them subverted like the PS2 initially did. Test variations Encrypted / compressed kernel decryption / decompression on boot. Run the power on / boot tests with: ROM that is not signed. ROM that is corrupted (should fail checksum). ROM with incorrect cert. Loading only signed code. Run the power on / boot tests with: Title with corrupted image (should fail checksum). Media with tampered / corrupt cert. Prevention / mitigation of downloading unauthorized code. If we actually do anything to try and stop this, add test cases here. We pretty much have to trust the title vendor on this. Prevention / mitigation of unauthorized use of the hard disk. Run the power on / boot tests with: Boot with a tampered-with hard disk - do we do the right thing? If we check for head / disk activity with a watchdog during certification: Write test that moves heads / reads / writes using alternate means while test is running and see if watchdog thread detects this. See if there is a way for the driver stack to determine if the caller is our code (this may be tricky, something like COM reference counting). Recovery from successful attacks See recovery spec and test plan. Detecting and not playing / executing invalid media. Try to boot images from media other than DVD-9 media format. Try to play DVD s from unsupported / wrong region. Try to make CDw/r copies of titles and play them. Ensuring during the certification process that the title is 'clean'. All images must be scanned with a virus scanner to detect and virus code that may have been slipped into the title. Using Driver Verifier and other monitoring tools, ensure both the quality and that the title is not attempting to do anything illegal. Set dates ahead to uncover time-bombs. Ensuring that the network stack is robust enough to survive attacks that crash the Xbox. Attack with various IP attack tools, the network test plan should cover this. Ensure that the network stack is not susceptible to buffer overrun attacks that can be used to inject code and hijack the Xbox. Attack with various IP attack tools, the network test plan should cover this. Review the code for dangerous memory allocation strategies and remove the ones that may be susceptible. Look at the new VC compiler that can detect stack overruns and see if the technology is appropriate for us (it will have some performance impact). Test complete criteria All test software needs to be written and function correctly.  There should be very little test software needed, so I don t see much of an impact here as far as time / resources needed to write code.  For the net attack stuff we should be able to use off the shelf software. The security testing will be Test Complete when all variations are enumerated and executed on the final hardware. Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? - All of the security tests need to pass before we ship. Which failures can we live with on this feature? - All fixable failures need to be fixed. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? - When no fixable failures exist.

                   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)



Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state

Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   is comprised of three main components:

      1. A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.

      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring,
         and testing the data-link connection.

      3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing
         and configuring different network-layer protocols.

   This document defines the PPP organization and methodology, and the
   PPP encapsulation, together with an extensible option negotiation
   mechanism which is able to negotiate a rich assortment of
   configuration parameters and provides additional management
   functions.  The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) is described in terms
   of this mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   The Point-to-Point Protocol is designed for simple links which
   transport packets between two peers.  These links provide full-duplex
   simultaneous bi-directional operation, and are assumed to deliver
   packets in order.  It is intended that PPP provide a common solution
   for easy connection of a wide variety of hosts, bridges and routers
   [1].

   Encapsulation

      The PPP encapsulation provides for multiplexing of different
      network-layer protocols simultaneously over the same link.  The
      PPP encapsulation has been carefully designed to retain
      compatibility with most commonly used supporting hardware.

      Only 8 additional octets are necessary to form the encapsulation
      when used within the default HDLC-like framing.  In environments
      where bandwidth is at a premium, the encapsulation and framing may
      be shortened to 2 or 4 octets.

      To support high speed implementations, the default encapsulation
      uses only simple fields, only one of which needs to be examined
      for demultiplexing.  The default header and information fields
      fall on 32-bit boundaries, and the trailer may be padded to an
      arbitrary boundary.

   Link Control Protocol

      In order to be sufficiently versatile to be portable to a wide
      variety of environments, PPP provides a Link Control Protocol
      (LCP).  The LCP is used to automatically agree upon the
      encapsulation format options, handle varying limits on sizes of
      packets, detect a looped-back link and other common
      misconfiguration errors, and terminate the link.  Other optional
      facilities provided are authentication of the identity of its peer
      on the link, and determination when a link is functioning properly
      and when it is failing.

   Network Control Protocols

      Point-to-Point links tend to exacerbate many problems with the
      current family of network protocols.  For instance, assignment and
      management of IP addresses, which is a problem even in LAN
      environments, is especially difficult over circuit-switched
      point-to-point links (such as dial-up modem servers).  These
      problems are handled by a family of Network Control Protocols
      (NCPs), which each manage the specific needs required by their



Simpson                                                         [Page 1]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      respective network-layer protocols.  These NCPs are defined in
      companion documents.

   Configuration

      It is intended that PPP links be easy to configure.  By design,
      the standard defaults handle all common configurations.  The
      implementor can specify improvements to the default configuration,
      which are automatically communicated to the peer without operator
      intervention.  Finally, the operator may explicitly configure
      options for the link which enable the link to operate in
      environments where it would otherwise be impossible.

      This self-configuration is implemented through an extensible
      option negotiation mechanism, wherein each end of the link
      describes to the other its capabilities and requirements.
      Although the option negotiation mechanism described in this
      document is specified in terms of the Link Control Protocol (LCP),
      the same facilities are designed to be used by other control
      protocols, especially the family of NCPs.



1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there
             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
             ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does include the option.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).
             A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets
             passed to the data link layer.

   frame     The unit of transmission at the data link layer.  A frame
             may include a header and/or a trailer, along with some
             number of units of data.

   packet    The basic unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the
             interface between the network layer and the data link
             layer.  A packet is usually mapped to a frame; the
             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation is being
             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated into a
             single frame.

   peer      The other end of the point-to-point link.

   silently discard
             The implementation discards the packet without further
             processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
             capability of logging the error, including the contents of
             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event
             in a statistics counter.

2.  PPP Encapsulation

   The PPP encapsulation is used to disambiguate multiprotocol
   datagrams.  This encapsulation requires framing to indicate the
   beginning and end of the encapsulation.  Methods of providing framing
   are specified in companion documents.

   A summary of the PPP encapsulation is shown below.  The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

           +----------+-------------+---------+
           | Protocol | Information | Padding |
           | 8/16 bits|      *      |    *    |
           +----------+-------------+---------+


   Protocol Field

      The Protocol field is one or two octets, and its value identifies
      the datagram encapsulated in the Information field of the packet.
      The field is transmitted and received most significant octet
      first.

      The structure of this field is consistent with the ISO 3309
      extension mechanism for address fields.  All Protocols MUST be
      odd; the least significant bit of the least significant octet MUST
      equal "1".  Also, all Protocols MUST be assigned such that the
      least significant bit of the most significant octet equals "0".
      Frames received which don't comply with these rules MUST be
      treated as having an unrecognized Protocol.

      Protocol field values in the "0***" to "3***" range identify the
      network-layer protocol of specific packets, and values in the
      "8***" to "b***" range identify packets belonging to the
      associated Network Control Protocols (NCPs), if any.

      Protocol field values in the "4***" to "7***" range are used for
      protocols with low volume traffic which have no associated NCP.
      Protocol field values in the "c***" to "f***" range identify
      packets as link-layer Control Protocols (such as LCP).











Simpson                                                         [Page 4]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      Up-to-date values of the Protocol field are specified in the most
      recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [2].  This specification reserves
      the following values:

      Value (in hex)  Protocol Name

      0001            Padding Protocol
      0003 to 001f    reserved (transparency inefficient)
      007d            reserved (Control Escape)
      00cf            reserved (PPP NLPID)
      00ff            reserved (compression inefficient)

      8001 to 801f    unused
      807d            unused
      80cf            unused
      80ff            unused

      c021            Link Control Protocol
      c023            Password Authentication Protocol
      c025            Link Quality Report
      c223            Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol

      Developers of new protocols MUST obtain a number from the Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), at IANA@isi.edu.


   Information Field

      The Information field is zero or more octets.  The Information
      field contains the datagram for the protocol specified in the
      Protocol field.

      The maximum length for the Information field, including Padding,
      but not including the Protocol field, is termed the Maximum
      Receive Unit (MRU), which defaults to 1500 octets.  By
      negotiation, consenting PPP implementations may use other values
      for the MRU.


   Padding

      On transmission, the Information field MAY be padded with an
      arbitrary number of octets up to the MRU.  It is the
      responsibility of each protocol to distinguish padding octets from
      real information.

3.  PPP Link Operation

3.1.  Overview

   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link, each
   end of the PPP link MUST first send LCP packets to configure and test
   the data link.  After the link has been established, the peer MAY be
   authenticated.

   Then, PPP MUST send NCP packets to choose and configure one or more
   network-layer protocols.  Once each of the chosen network-layer
   protocols has been configured, datagrams from each network-layer
   protocol can be sent over the link.

   The link will remain configured for communications until explicit LCP
   or NCP packets close the link down, or until some external event
   occurs (an inactivity timer expires or network administrator
   intervention).



3.2.  Phase Diagram

   In the process of configuring, maintaining and terminating the
   point-to-point link, the PPP link goes through several distinct
   phases which are specified in the following simplified state diagram:

   +------+        +-----------+           +--------------+
   |      | UP     |           | OPENED    |              | SUCCESS/NONE
   | Dead |------->| Establish |---------->| Authenticate |--+
   |      |        |           |           |              |  |
   +------+        +-----------+           +--------------+  |
      ^               |                        |             |
      |          FAIL |                   FAIL |             |
      +<--------------+             +----------+             |
      |                             |                        |
      |            +-----------+    |           +---------+  |
      |       DOWN |           |    |   CLOSING |         |  |
      +------------| Terminate |<---+<----------| Network |<-+
                   |           |                |         |
                   +-----------+                +---------+

   Not all transitions are specified in this diagram.  The following
   semantics MUST be followed.







Simpson                                                         [Page 6]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


3.3.  Link Dead (physical-layer not ready)

   The link necessarily begins and ends with this phase.  When an
   external event (such as carrier detection or network administrator
   configuration) indicates that the physical-layer is ready to be used,
   PPP will proceed to the Link Establishment phase.

   During this phase, the LCP automaton (described later) will be in the
   Initial or Starting states.  The transition to the Link Establishment
   phase will signal an Up event to the LCP automaton.

   Implementation Note:

      Typically, a link will return to this phase automatically after
      the disconnection of a modem.  In the case of a hard-wired link,
      this phase may be extremely short -- merely long enough to detect
      the presence of the device.



3.4.  Link Establishment Phase

   The Link Control Protocol (LCP) is used to establish the connection
   through an exchange of Configure packets.  This exchange is complete,
   and the LCP Opened state entered, once a Configure-Ack packet
   (described later) has been both sent and received.

   All Configuration Options are assumed to be at default values unless
   altered by the configuration exchange.  See the chapter on LCP
   Configuration Options for further discussion.

   It is important to note that only Configuration Options which are
   independent of particular network-layer protocols are configured by
   LCP.  Configuration of individual network-layer protocols is handled
   by separate Network Control Protocols (NCPs) during the Network-Layer
   Protocol phase.

   Any non-LCP packets received during this phase MUST be silently
   discarded.

   The receipt of the LCP Configure-Request causes a return to the Link
   Establishment phase from the Network-Layer Protocol phase or
   Authentication phase.

3.5.  Authentication Phase

   On some links it may be desirable to require a peer to authenticate
   itself before allowing network-layer protocol packets to be
   exchanged.

   By default, authentication is not mandatory.  If an implementation
   desires that the peer authenticate with some specific authentication
   protocol, then it MUST request the use of that authentication
   protocol during Link Establishment phase.

   Authentication SHOULD take place as soon as possible after link
   establishment.  However, link quality determination MAY occur
   concurrently.  An implementation MUST NOT allow the exchange of link
   quality determination packets to delay authentication indefinitely.

   Advancement from the Authentication phase to the Network-Layer
   Protocol phase MUST NOT occur until authentication has completed.  If
   authentication fails, the authenticator SHOULD proceed instead to the
   Link Termination phase.

   Only Link Control Protocol, authentication protocol, and link quality
   monitoring packets are allowed during this phase.  All other packets
   received during this phase MUST be silently discarded.

   Implementation Notes:

      An implementation SHOULD NOT fail authentication simply due to
      timeout or lack of response.  The authentication SHOULD allow some
      method of retransmission, and proceed to the Link Termination
      phase only after a number of authentication attempts has been
      exceeded.

      The implementation responsible for commencing Link Termination
      phase is the implementation which has refused authentication to
      its peer.



3.6.  Network-Layer Protocol Phase

   Once PPP has finished the previous phases, each network-layer
   protocol (such as IP, IPX, or AppleTalk) MUST be separately
   configured by the appropriate Network Control Protocol (NCP).

   Each NCP MAY be Opened and Closed at any time.





Simpson                                                         [Page 8]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


   Implementation Note:

      Because an implementation may initially use a significant amount
      of time for link quality determination, implementations SHOULD
      avoid fixed timeouts when waiting for their peers to configure a
      NCP.

   After a NCP has reached the Opened state, PPP will carry the
   corresponding network-layer protocol packets.  Any supported
   network-layer protocol packets received when the corresponding NCP is
   not in the Opened state MUST be silently discarded.

   Implementation Note:

      While LCP is in the Opened state, any protocol packet which is
      unsupported by the implementation MUST be returned in a Protocol-
      Reject (described later).  Only protocols which are supported are
      silently discarded.

   During this phase, link traffic consists of any possible combination
   of LCP, NCP, and network-layer protocol packets.



3.7.  Link Termination Phase

   PPP can terminate the link at any time.  This might happen because of
   the loss of carrier, authentication failure, link quality failure,
   the expiration of an idle-period timer, or the administrative closing
   of the link.

   LCP is used to close the link through an exchange of Terminate
   packets.  When the link is closing, PPP informs the network-layer
   protocols so that they may take appropriate action.

   After the exchange of Terminate packets, the implementation SHOULD
   signal the physical-layer to disconnect in order to enforce the
   termination of the link, particularly in the case of an
   authentication failure.  The sender of the Terminate-Request SHOULD
   disconnect after receiving a Terminate-Ack, or after the Restart
   counter expires.  The receiver of a Terminate-Request SHOULD wait for
   the peer to disconnect, and MUST NOT disconnect until at least one
   Restart time has passed after sending a Terminate-Ack.  PPP SHOULD
   proceed to the Link Dead phase.

   Any non-LCP packets received during this phase MUST be silently
   discarded.

RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


   Implementation Note:

      The closing of the link by LCP is sufficient.  There is no need
      for each NCP to send a flurry of Terminate packets.  Conversely,
      the fact that one NCP has Closed is not sufficient reason to cause
      the termination of the PPP link, even if that NCP was the only NCP
      currently in the Opened state.

4.  The Option Negotiation Automaton

   The finite-state automaton is defined by events, actions and state
   transitions.  Events include reception of external commands such as
   Open and Close, expiration of the Restart timer, and reception of
   packets from a peer.  Actions include the starting of the Restart
   timer and transmission of packets to the peer.

   Some types of packets -- Configure-Naks and Configure-Rejects, or
   Code-Rejects and Protocol-Rejects, or Echo-Requests, Echo-Replies and
   Discard-Requests -- are not differentiated in the automaton
   descriptions.  As will be described later, these packets do indeed
   serve different functions.  However, they always cause the same
   transitions.

4.1.  State Transition Table

   The complete state transition table follows.  States are indicated
   horizontally, and events are read vertically.  State transitions and
   actions are represented in the form action/new-state.  Multiple
   actions are separated by commas, and may continue on succeeding lines
   as space requires; multiple actions may be implemented in any
   convenient order.  The state may be followed by a letter, which
   indicates an explanatory footnote.  The dash ('-') indicates an
   illegal transition.

   The states in which the Restart timer is running are identifiable by
   the presence of TO events.  Only the Send-Configure-Request, Send-
   Terminate-Request and Zero-Restart-Count actions start or re-start
   the Restart timer.  The Restart timer is stopped when transitioning
   from any state where the timer is running to a state where the timer
   is not running.

   The events and actions are defined according to a message passing
   architecture, rather than a signalling architecture.  If an action is
   desired to control specific signals (such as DTR), additional actions
   are likely to be required.

4.2.  States

   Following is a more detailed description of each automaton state.

   Initial

      In the Initial state, the lower layer is unavailable (Down), and
      no Open has occurred.  The Restart timer is not running in the
      Initial state.

   Starting

      The Starting state is the Open counterpart to the Initial state.
      An administrative Open has been initiated, but the lower layer is
      still unavailable (Down).  The Restart timer is not running in the
      Starting state.

      When the lower layer becomes available (Up), a Configure-Request
      is sent.

   Closed

      In the Closed state, the link is available (Up), but no Open has
      occurred.  The Restart timer is not running in the Closed state.

      Upon reception of Configure-Request packets, a Terminate-Ack is
      sent.  Terminate-Acks are silently discarded to avoid creating a
      loop.

   Stopped

      The Stopped state is the Open counterpart to the Closed state.  It
      is entered when the automaton is waiting for a Down event after
      the This-Layer-Finished action, or after sending a Terminate-Ack.
      The Restart timer is not running in the Stopped state.

      Upon reception of Configure-Request packets, an appropriate
      response is sent.  Upon reception of other packets, a Terminate-
      Ack is sent.  Terminate-Acks are silently discarded to avoid
      creating a loop.

      Rationale:

         The Stopped state is a junction state for link termination,
         link configuration failure, and other automaton failure modes.
         These potentially separate states have been combined.

         There is a race condition between the Down event response (from



Simpson                                                        [Page 14]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


         the This-Layer-Finished action) and the Receive-Configure-
         Request event.  When a Configure-Request arrives before the
         Down event, the Down event will supercede by returning the
         automaton to the Starting state.  This prevents attack by
         repetition.

      Implementation Option:

         After the peer fails to respond to Configure-Requests, an
         implementation MAY wait passively for the peer to send
         Configure-Requests.  In this case, the This-Layer-Finished
         action is not used for the TO- event in states Req-Sent, Ack-
         Rcvd and Ack-Sent.

         This option is useful for dedicated circuits, or circuits which
         have no status signals available, but SHOULD NOT be used for
         switched circuits.

   Closing

      In the Closing state, an attempt is made to terminate the
      connection.  A Terminate-Request has been sent and the Restart
      timer is running, but a Terminate-Ack has not yet been received.

      Upon reception of a Terminate-Ack, the Closed state is entered.
      Upon the expiration of the Restart timer, a new Terminate-Request
      is transmitted, and the Restart timer is restarted.  After the
      Restart timer has expired Max-Terminate times, the Closed state is
      entered.

   Stopping

      The Stopping state is the Open counterpart to the Closing state.
      A Terminate-Request has been sent and the Restart timer is
      running, but a Terminate-Ack has not yet been received.

      Rationale:

         The Stopping state provides a well defined opportunity to
         terminate a link before allowing new traffic.  After the link
         has terminated, a new configuration may occur via the Stopped
         or Starting states.

   Request-Sent

      In the Request-Sent state an attempt is made to configure the
      connection.  A Configure-Request has been sent and the Restart
      timer is running, but a Configure-Ack has not yet been received



Simpson                                                        [Page 15]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      nor has one been sent.

   Ack-Received

      In the Ack-Received state, a Configure-Request has been sent and a
      Configure-Ack has been received.  The Restart timer is still
      running, since a Configure-Ack has not yet been sent.

   Ack-Sent

      In the Ack-Sent state, a Configure-Request and a Configure-Ack
      have both been sent, but a Configure-Ack has not yet been
      received.  The Restart timer is running, since a Configure-Ack has
      not yet been received.

   Opened

      In the Opened state, a Configure-Ack has been both sent and
      received.  The Restart timer is not running.

      When entering the Opened state, the implementation SHOULD signal
      the upper layers that it is now Up.  Conversely, when leaving the
      Opened state, the implementation SHOULD signal the upper layers
      that it is now Down.



4.3.  Events

   Transitions and actions in the automaton are caused by events.

   Up

      This event occurs when a lower layer indicates that it is ready to
      carry packets.

      Typically, this event is used by a modem handling or calling
      process, or by some other coupling of the PPP link to the physical
      media, to signal LCP that the link is entering Link Establishment
      phase.

      It also can be used by LCP to signal each NCP that the link is
      entering Network-Layer Protocol phase.  That is, the This-Layer-Up
      action from LCP triggers the Up event in the NCP.

   Down

      This event occurs when a lower layer indicates that it is no



Simpson                                                        [Page 16]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      longer ready to carry packets.

      Typically, this event is used by a modem handling or calling
      process, or by some other coupling of the PPP link to the physical
      media, to signal LCP that the link is entering Link Dead phase.

      It also can be used by LCP to signal each NCP that the link is
      leaving Network-Layer Protocol phase.  That is, the This-Layer-
      Down action from LCP triggers the Down event in the NCP.

   Open

      This event indicates that the link is administratively available
      for traffic; that is, the network administrator (human or program)
      has indicated that the link is allowed to be Opened.  When this
      event occurs, and the link is not in the Opened state, the
      automaton attempts to send configuration packets to the peer.

      If the automaton is not able to begin configuration (the lower
      layer is Down, or a previous Close event has not completed), the
      establishment of the link is automatically delayed.

      When a Terminate-Request is received, or other events occur which
      cause the link to become unavailable, the automaton will progress
      to a state where the link is ready to re-open.  No additional
      administrative intervention is necessary.

      Implementation Option:

         Experience has shown that users will execute an additional Open
         command when they want to renegotiate the link.  This might
         indicate that new values are to be negotiated.

         Since this is not the meaning of the Open event, it is
         suggested that when an Open user command is executed in the
         Opened, Closing, Stopping, or Stopped states, the
         implementation issue a Down event, immediately followed by an
         Up event.  Care must be taken that an intervening Down event
         cannot occur from another source.

         The Down followed by an Up will cause an orderly renegotiation
         of the link, by progressing through the Starting to the
         Request-Sent state.  This will cause the renegotiation of the
         link, without any harmful side effects.

   Close

      This event indicates that the link is not available for traffic;



Simpson                                                        [Page 17]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      that is, the network administrator (human or program) has
      indicated that the link is not allowed to be Opened.  When this
      event occurs, and the link is not in the Closed state, the
      automaton attempts to terminate the connection.  Futher attempts
      to re-configure the link are denied until a new Open event occurs.

      Implementation Note:

         When authentication fails, the link SHOULD be terminated, to
         prevent attack by repetition and denial of service to other
         users.  Since the link is administratively available (by
         definition), this can be accomplished by simulating a Close
         event to the LCP, immediately followed by an Open event.  Care
         must be taken that an intervening Close event cannot occur from
         another source.

         The Close followed by an Open will cause an orderly termination
         of the link, by progressing through the Closing to the Stopping
         state, and the This-Layer-Finished action can disconnect the
         link.  The automaton waits in the Stopped or Starting states
         for the next connection attempt.

   Timeout (TO+,TO-)

      This event indicates the expiration of the Restart timer.  The
      Restart timer is used to time responses to Configure-Request and
      Terminate-Request packets.

      The TO+ event indicates that the Restart counter continues to be
      greater than zero, which triggers the corresponding Configure-
      Request or Terminate-Request packet to be retransmitted.

      The TO- event indicates that the Restart counter is not greater
      than zero, and no more packets need to be retransmitted.

   Receive-Configure-Request (RCR+,RCR-)

      This event occurs when a Configure-Request packet is received from
      the peer.  The Configure-Request packet indicates the desire to
      open a connection and may specify Configuration Options.  The
      Configure-Request packet is more fully described in a later
      section.

      The RCR+ event indicates that the Configure-Request was
      acceptable, and triggers the transmission of a corresponding
      Configure-Ack.

      The RCR- event indicates that the Configure-Request was



Simpson                                                        [Page 18]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      unacceptable, and triggers the transmission of a corresponding
      Configure-Nak or Configure-Reject.

      Implementation Note:

         These events may occur on a connection which is already in the
         Opened state.  The implementation MUST be prepared to
         immediately renegotiate the Configuration Options.

   Receive-Configure-Ack (RCA)

      This event occurs when a valid Configure-Ack packet is received
      from the peer.  The Configure-Ack packet is a positive response to
      a Configure-Request packet.  An out of sequence or otherwise
      invalid packet is silently discarded.

      Implementation Note:

         Since the correct packet has already been received before
         reaching the Ack-Rcvd or Opened states, it is extremely
         unlikely that another such packet will arrive.  As specified,
         all invalid Ack/Nak/Rej packets are silently discarded, and do
         not affect the transitions of the automaton.

         However, it is not impossible that a correctly formed packet
         will arrive through a coincidentally-timed cross-connection.
         It is more likely to be the result of an implementation error.
         At the very least, this occurance SHOULD be logged.

   Receive-Configure-Nak/Rej (RCN)

      This event occurs when a valid Configure-Nak or Configure-Reject
      packet is received from the peer.  The Configure-Nak and
      Configure-Reject packets are negative responses to a Configure-
      Request packet.  An out of sequence or otherwise invalid packet is
      silently discarded.

      Implementation Note:

         Although the Configure-Nak and Configure-Reject cause the same
         state transition in the automaton, these packets have
         significantly different effects on the Configuration Options
         sent in the resulting Configure-Request packet.

   Receive-Terminate-Request (RTR)

      This event occurs when a Terminate-Request packet is received.
      The Terminate-Request packet indicates the desire of the peer to



Simpson                                                        [Page 19]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      close the connection.

      Implementation Note:

         This event is not identical to the Close event (see above), and
         does not override the Open commands of the local network
         administrator.  The implementation MUST be prepared to receive
         a new Configure-Request without network administrator
         intervention.

   Receive-Terminate-Ack (RTA)

      This event occurs when a Terminate-Ack packet is received from the
      peer.  The Terminate-Ack packet is usually a response to a
      Terminate-Request packet.  The Terminate-Ack packet may also
      indicate that the peer is in Closed or Stopped states, and serves
      to re-synchronize the link configuration.

   Receive-Unknown-Code (RUC)

      This event occurs when an un-interpretable packet is received from
      the peer.  A Code-Reject packet is sent in response.

   Receive-Code-Reject, Receive-Protocol-Reject (RXJ+,RXJ-)

      This event occurs when a Code-Reject or a Protocol-Reject packet
      is received from the peer.

      The RXJ+ event arises when the rejected value is acceptable, such
      as a Code-Reject of an extended code, or a Protocol-Reject of a
      NCP.  These are within the scope of normal operation.  The
      implementation MUST stop sending the offending packet type.

      The RXJ- event arises when the rejected value is catastrophic,
      such as a Code-Reject of Configure-Request, or a Protocol-Reject
      of LCP!  This event communicates an unrecoverable error that
      terminates the connection.

   Receive-Echo-Request, Receive-Echo-Reply, Receive-Discard-Request
   (RXR)

      This event occurs when an Echo-Request, Echo-Reply or Discard-
      Request packet is received from the peer.  The Echo-Reply packet
      is a response to an Echo-Request packet.  There is no reply to an
      Echo-Reply or Discard-Request packet.

4.4.  Actions

   Actions in the automaton are caused by events and typically indicate
   the transmission of packets and/or the starting or stopping of the
   Restart timer.

   Illegal-Event (-)

      This indicates an event that cannot occur in a properly
      implemented automaton.  The implementation has an internal error,
      which should be reported and logged.  No transition is taken, and
      the implementation SHOULD NOT reset or freeze.

   This-Layer-Up (tlu)

      This action indicates to the upper layers that the automaton is
      entering the Opened state.

      Typically, this action is used by the LCP to signal the Up event
      to a NCP, Authentication Protocol, or Link Quality Protocol, or
      MAY be used by a NCP to indicate that the link is available for
      its network layer traffic.

   This-Layer-Down (tld)

      This action indicates to the upper layers that the automaton is
      leaving the Opened state.

      Typically, this action is used by the LCP to signal the Down event
      to a NCP, Authentication Protocol, or Link Quality Protocol, or
      MAY be used by a NCP to indicate that the link is no longer
      available for its network layer traffic.

   This-Layer-Started (tls)

      This action indicates to the lower layers that the automaton is
      entering the Starting state, and the lower layer is needed for the
      link.  The lower layer SHOULD respond with an Up event when the
      lower layer is available.

      This results of this action are highly implementation dependent.

   This-Layer-Finished (tlf)

      This action indicates to the lower layers that the automaton is
      entering the Initial, Closed or Stopped states, and the lower
      layer is no longer needed for the link.  The lower layer SHOULD
      respond with a Down event when the lower layer has terminated.



Simpson                                                        [Page 21]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      Typically, this action MAY be used by the LCP to advance to the
      Link Dead phase, or MAY be used by a NCP to indicate to the LCP
      that the link may terminate when there are no other NCPs open.

      This results of this action are highly implementation dependent.

   Initialize-Restart-Count (irc)

      This action sets the Restart counter to the appropriate value
      (Max-Terminate or Max-Configure).  The counter is decremented for
      each transmission, including the first.

      Implementation Note:

         In addition to setting the Restart counter, the implementation
         MUST set the timeout period to the initial value when Restart
         timer backoff is used.

   Zero-Restart-Count (zrc)

      This action sets the Restart counter to zero.

      Implementation Note:

         This action enables the FSA to pause before proceeding to the
         desired final state, allowing traffic to be processed by the
         peer.  In addition to zeroing the Restart counter, the
         implementation MUST set the timeout period to an appropriate
         value.

   Send-Configure-Request (scr)

      A Configure-Request packet is transmitted.  This indicates the
      desire to open a connection with a specified set of Configuration
      Options.  The Restart timer is started when the Configure-Request
      packet is transmitted, to guard against packet loss.  The Restart
      counter is decremented each time a Configure-Request is sent.

   Send-Configure-Ack (sca)

      A Configure-Ack packet is transmitted.  This acknowledges the
      reception of a Configure-Request packet with an acceptable set of
      Configuration Options.

   Send-Configure-Nak (scn)

      A Configure-Nak or Configure-Reject packet is transmitted, as
      appropriate.  This negative response reports the reception of a



Simpson                                                        [Page 22]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      Configure-Request packet with an unacceptable set of Configuration
      Options.

      Configure-Nak packets are used to refuse a Configuration Option
      value, and to suggest a new, acceptable value.  Configure-Reject
      packets are used to refuse all negotiation about a Configuration
      Option, typically because it is not recognized or implemented.
      The use of Configure-Nak versus Configure-Reject is more fully
      described in the chapter on LCP Packet Formats.

   Send-Terminate-Request (str)

      A Terminate-Request packet is transmitted.  This indicates the
      desire to close a connection.  The Restart timer is started when
      the Terminate-Request packet is transmitted, to guard against
      packet loss.  The Restart counter is decremented each time a
      Terminate-Request is sent.

   Send-Terminate-Ack (sta)

      A Terminate-Ack packet is transmitted.  This acknowledges the
      reception of a Terminate-Request packet or otherwise serves to
      synchronize the automatons.

   Send-Code-Reject (scj)

      A Code-Reject packet is transmitted.  This indicates the reception
      of an unknown type of packet.

   Send-Echo-Reply (ser)

      An Echo-Reply packet is transmitted.  This acknowledges the
      reception of an Echo-Request packet.



4.5.  Loop Avoidance

   The protocol makes a reasonable attempt at avoiding Configuration
   Option negotiation loops.  However, the protocol does NOT guarantee
   that loops will not happen.  As with any negotiation, it is possible
   to configure two PPP implementations with conflicting policies that
   will never converge.  It is also possible to configure policies which
   do converge, but which take significant time to do so.  Implementors
   should keep this in mind and SHOULD implement loop detection
   mechanisms or higher level timeouts.





Simpson                                                        [Page 23]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


4.6.  Counters and Timers

   Restart Timer

      There is one special timer used by the automaton.  The Restart
      timer is used to time transmissions of Configure-Request and
      Terminate-Request packets.  Expiration of the Restart timer causes
      a Timeout event, and retransmission of the corresponding
      Configure-Request or Terminate-Request packet.  The Restart timer
      MUST be configurable, but SHOULD default to three (3) seconds.

      Implementation Note:

         The Restart timer SHOULD be based on the speed of the link.
         The default value is designed for low speed (2,400 to 9,600
         bps), high switching latency links (typical telephone lines).
         Higher speed links, or links with low switching latency, SHOULD
         have correspondingly faster retransmission times.

         Instead of a constant value, the Restart timer MAY begin at an
         initial small value and increase to the configured final value.
         Each successive value less than the final value SHOULD be at
         least twice the previous value.  The initial value SHOULD be
         large enough to account for the size of the packets, twice the
         round trip time for transmission at the link speed, and at
         least an additional 100 milliseconds to allow the peer to
         process the packets before responding.  Some circuits add
         another 200 milliseconds of satellite delay.  Round trip times
         for modems operating at 14,400 bps have been measured in the
         range of 160 to more than 600 milliseconds.

   Max-Terminate

      There is one required restart counter for Terminate-Requests.
      Max-Terminate indicates the number of Terminate-Request packets
      sent without receiving a Terminate-Ack before assuming that the
      peer is unable to respond.  Max-Terminate MUST be configurable,
      but SHOULD default to two (2) transmissions.

   Max-Configure

      A similar counter is recommended for Configure-Requests.  Max-
      Configure indicates the number of Configure-Request packets sent
      without receiving a valid Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak or
      Configure-Reject before assuming that the peer is unable to
      respond.  Max-Configure MUST be configurable, but SHOULD default
      to ten (10) transmissions.




Simpson                                                        [Page 24]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


   Max-Failure

      A related counter is recommended for Configure-Nak.  Max-Failure
      indicates the number of Configure-Nak packets sent without sending
      a Configure-Ack before assuming that configuration is not
      converging.  Any further Configure-Nak packets for peer requested
      options are converted to Configure-Reject packets, and locally
      desired options are no longer appended.  Max-Failure MUST be
      configurable, but SHOULD default to five (5) transmissions.

5.  LCP Packet Formats

   There are three classes of LCP packets:

      1. Link Configuration packets used to establish and configure a
         link (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak and
         Configure-Reject).

      2. Link Termination packets used to terminate a link (Terminate-
         Request and Terminate-Ack).

      3. Link Maintenance packets used to manage and debug a link
         (Code-Reject, Protocol-Reject, Echo-Request, Echo-Reply, and
         Discard-Request).

   In the interest of simplicity, there is no version field in the LCP
   packet.  A correctly functioning LCP implementation will always
   respond to unknown Protocols and Codes with an easily recognizable
   LCP packet, thus providing a deterministic fallback mechanism for
   implementations of other versions.

   Regardless of which Configuration Options are enabled, all LCP Link
   Configuration, Link Termination, and Code-Reject packets (codes 1
   through 7) are always sent as if no Configuration Options were
   negotiated.  In particular, each Configuration Option specifies a
   default value.  This ensures that such LCP packets are always
   recognizable, even when one end of the link mistakenly believes the
   link to be open.

   Exactly one LCP packet is encapsulated in the PPP Information field,
   where the PPP Protocol field indicates type hex c021 (Link Control
   Protocol).

   A summary of the Link Control Protocol packet format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Code

      The Code field is one octet, and identifies the kind of LCP



Simpson                                                        [Page 26]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      packet.  When a packet is received with an unknown Code field, a
      Code-Reject packet is transmitted.

      Up-to-date values of the LCP Code field are specified in the most
      recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [2].  This document concerns the
      following values:

         1       Configure-Request
         2       Configure-Ack
         3       Configure-Nak
         4       Configure-Reject
         5       Terminate-Request
         6       Terminate-Ack
         7       Code-Reject
         8       Protocol-Reject
         9       Echo-Request
         10      Echo-Reply
         11      Discard-Request


   Identifier

      The Identifier field is one octet, and aids in matching requests
      and replies.  When a packet is received with an invalid Identifier
      field, the packet is silently discarded without affecting the
      automaton.

   Length

      The Length field is two octets, and indicates the length of the
      LCP packet, including the Code, Identifier, Length and Data
      fields.  The Length MUST NOT exceed the MRU of the link.

      Octets outside the range of the Length field are treated as
      padding and are ignored on reception.  When a packet is received
      with an invalid Length field, the packet is silently discarded
      without affecting the automaton.

   Data

      The Data field is zero or more octets, as indicated by the Length
      field.  The format of the Data field is determined by the Code
      field.

5.1.  Configure-Request

   Description

      An implementation wishing to open a connection MUST transmit a
      Configure-Request.  The Options field is filled with any desired
      changes to the link defaults.  Configuration Options SHOULD NOT be
      included with default values.

      Upon reception of a Configure-Request, an appropriate reply MUST
      be transmitted.

   A summary of the Configure-Request packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

5.2.  Configure-Ack

   Description

      If every Configuration Option received in a Configure-Request is
      recognizable and all values are acceptable, then the
      implementation MUST transmit a Configure-Ack.  The acknowledged
      Configuration Options MUST NOT be reordered or modified in any
      way.

      On reception of a Configure-Ack, the Identifier field MUST match
      that of the last transmitted Configure-Request.  Additionally, the
      Configuration Options in a Configure-Ack MUST exactly match those
      of the last transmitted Configure-Request.  Invalid packets are
      silently discarded.

   A summary of the Configure-Ack packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

5.3.  Configure-Nak

   Description

      If every instance of the received Configuration Options is
      recognizable, but some values are not acceptable, then the
      implementation MUST transmit a Configure-Nak.  The Options field
      is filled with only the unacceptable Configuration Options from
      the Configure-Request.  All acceptable Configuration Options are
      filtered out of the Configure-Nak, but otherwise the Configuration
      Options from the Configure-Request MUST NOT be reordered.

      Options which have no value fields (boolean options) MUST use the
      Configure-Reject reply instead.

      Each Configuration Option which is allowed only a single instance
      MUST be modified to a value acceptable to the Configure-Nak
      sender.  The default value MAY be used, when this differs from the
      requested value.

      When a particular type of Configuration Option can be listed more
      than once with different values, the Configure-Nak MUST include a
      list of all values for that option which are acceptable to the
      Configure-Nak sender.  This includes acceptable values that were
      present in the Configure-Request.

      Finally, an implementation may be configured to request the
      negotiation of a specific Configuration Option.  If that option is
      not listed, then that option MAY be appended to the list of Nak'd
      Configuration Options, in order to prompt the peer to include that
      option in its next Configure-Request packet.  Any value fields for
      the option MUST indicate values acceptable to the Configure-Nak
      sender.

      On reception of a Configure-Nak, the Identifier field MUST match
      that of the last transmitted Configure-Request.  Invalid packets
      are silently discarded.

      Reception of a valid Configure-Nak indicates that when a new
      Configure-Request is sent, the Configuration Options MAY be
      modified as specified in the Configure-Nak.  When multiple
      instances of a Configuration Option are present, the peer SHOULD
      select a single value to include in its next Configure-Request
      packet.

      Some Configuration Options have a variable length.  Since the
      Nak'd Option has been modified by the peer, the implementation
      MUST be able to handle an Option length which is different from

      zero or more Configuration Options that the sender is Nak'ing.
      All Configuration Options are always Nak'd simultaneously.



5.4.  Configure-Reject

   Description

      If some Configuration Options received in a Configure-Request are
      not recognizable or are not acceptable for negotiation (as
      configured by a network administrator), then the implementation
      MUST transmit a Configure-Reject.  The Options field is filled
      with only the unacceptable Configuration Options from the
      Configure-Request.  All recognizable and negotiable Configuration
      Options are filtered out of the Configure-Reject, but otherwise
      the Configuration Options MUST NOT be reordered or modified in any
      way.

      On reception of a Configure-Reject, the Identifier field MUST
      match that of the last transmitted Configure-Request.
      Additionally, the Configuration Options in a Configure-Reject MUST

      Request.  Invalid packets are silently discarded.

      Reception of a valid Configure-Reject indicates that when a new
      Configure-Request is sent, it MUST NOT include any of the

5.5.  Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack

   Description

      LCP includes Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack Codes in order to
      provide a mechanism for closing a connection.

      An implementation wishing to close a connection SHOULD transmit a
      Terminate-Request.  Terminate-Request packets SHOULD continue to
      be sent until Terminate-Ack is received, the lower layer indicates
      that it has gone down, or a sufficiently large number have been
      transmitted such that the peer is down with reasonable certainty.

      Upon reception of a Terminate-Request, a Terminate-Ack MUST be
      transmitted.

      Reception of an unelicited Terminate-Ack indicates that the peer
      is in the Closed or Stopped states, or is otherwise in need of
      re-negotiation.

   A summary of the Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack packet formats
   is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Data

      The Data field is zero or more octets, and contains uninterpreted

      value.  The end of the field is indicated by the Length.



5.6.  Code-Reject

   Description

      Reception of a LCP packet with an unknown Code indicates that the
      peer is operating with a different version.  This MUST be reported
      back to the sender of the unknown Code by transmitting a Code-
      Reject.

      Upon reception of the Code-Reject of a code which is fundamental
      to this version of the protocol, the implementation SHOULD report
      the problem and drop the connection, since it is unlikely that the
      situation can be rectified automatically.

   A summary of the Code-Reject packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

5.7.  Protocol-Reject

   Description

      Reception of a PPP packet with an unknown Protocol field indicates
      that the peer is attempting to use a protocol which is
      unsupported.  This usually occurs when the peer attempts to
      configure a new protocol.  If the LCP automaton is in the Opened
      state, then this MUST be reported back to the peer by transmitting
      a Protocol-Reject.

      Upon reception of a Protocol-Reject, the implementation MUST stop
      sending packets of the indicated protocol at the earliest
      opportunity.

      Protocol-Reject packets can only be sent in the LCP Opened state.
      Protocol-Reject packets received in any state other than the LCP
      Opened state SHOULD be silently discarded.

   A summary of the Protocol-Reject packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

5.8.  Echo-Request and Echo-Reply

   Description

      LCP includes Echo-Request and Echo-Reply Codes in order to provide
      a Data Link Layer loopback mechanism for use in exercising both
      directions of the link.  This is useful as an aid in debugging,
      link quality determination, performance testing, and for numerous
      other functions.

      Upon reception of an Echo-Request in the LCP Opened state, an
      Echo-Reply MUST be transmitted.

      Echo-Request and Echo-Reply packets MUST only be sent in the LCP
      Opened state.  Echo-Request and Echo-Reply packets received in any
      state other than the LCP Opened state SHOULD be silently
      discarded.

6.  LCP Configuration Options

   LCP Configuration Options allow negotiation of modifications to the
   default characteristics of a point-to-point link.  If a Configuration
   Option is not included in a Configure-Request packet, the default
   value for that Configuration Option is assumed.

   Some Configuration Options MAY be listed more than once.  The effect
   of this is Configuration Option specific, and is specified by each
   such Configuration Option description.  (None of the Configuration
   Options in this specification can be listed more than once.)

   The end of the list of Configuration Options is indicated by the
   Length field of the LCP packet.

   Unless otherwise specified, all Configuration Options apply in a
   half-duplex fashion; typically, in the receive direction of the link
   from the point of view of the Configure-Request sender.

   Design Philosophy

      The options indicate additional capabilities or requirements of
      the implementation that is requesting the option.  An
      implementation which does not understand any option SHOULD
      interoperate with one which implements every option.

      A default is specified for each option which allows the link to
      correctly function without negotiation of the option, although
      perhaps with less than optimal performance.

      Except where explicitly specified, acknowledgement of an option
      does not require the peer to take any additional action other than
      the default.

      It is not necessary to send the default values for the options in
      a Configure-Request.


   A summary of the Configuration Option format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Type

      The Type field is one octet, and indicates the type of
      Configuration Option.  Up-to-date values of the LCP Option Type
      field are specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [2].
      This document concerns the following values:

         7       Protocol-Field-Compression
         8       Address-and-Control-Field-Compression


   Length

      The Length field is one octet, and indicates the length of this
      Configuration Option including the Type, Length and Data fields.

      If a negotiable Configuration Option is received in a Configure-
      Request, but with an invalid or unrecognized Length, a Configure-
      Nak SHOULD be transmitted which includes the desired Configuration
      Option with an appropriate Length and Data.

   Data

      The Data field is zero or more octets, and contains information
      specific to the Configuration Option.  The format and length of
      the Data field is determined by the Type and Length fields.

      When the Data field is indicated by the Length to extend beyond
      the end of the Information field, the entire packet is silently
      discarded without affecting the automaton.

6.1.  Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU)

   Description

      This Configuration Option may be sent to inform the peer that the
      implementation can receive larger packets, or to request that the
      peer send smaller packets.

      The default value is 1500 octets.  If smaller packets are
      requested, an implementation MUST still be able to receive the
      full 1500 octet information field in case link synchronization is
      lost.

      Implementation Note:

         This option is used to indicate an implementation capability.
         The peer is not required to maximize the use of the capacity.
         For example, when a MRU is indicated which is 2048 octets, the
         peer is not required to send any packet with 2048 octets.  The
         peer need not Configure-Nak to indicate that it will only send
         smaller packets, since the implementation will always require
         support for at least 1500 octets.

6.2.  Authentication-Protocol

   Description

      On some links it may be desirable to require a peer to
      authenticate itself before allowing network-layer protocol packets
      to be exchanged.

      This Configuration Option provides a method to negotiate the use
      of a specific protocol for authentication.  By default,
      authentication is not required.

      An implementation MUST NOT include multiple Authentication-
      Protocol Configuration Options in its Configure-Request packets.
      Instead, it SHOULD attempt to configure the most desirable
      protocol first.  If that protocol is Configure-Nak'd, then the
      implementation SHOULD attempt the next most desirable protocol in
      the next Configure-Request.

      The implementation sending the Configure-Request is indicating
      that it expects authentication from its peer.  If an
      implementation sends a Configure-Ack, then it is agreeing to
      authenticate with the specified protocol.  An implementation
      receiving a Configure-Ack SHOULD expect the peer to authenticate
      with the acknowledged protocol.

      There is no requirement that authentication be full-duplex or that
      the same protocol be used in both directions.  It is perfectly
      acceptable for different protocols to be used in each direction.
      This will, of course, depend on the specific protocols negotiated.

   is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      authentication protocol.

      Up-to-date values of the Authentication-Protocol field are
      specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [2].  Current
      values are assigned as follows:

      Value (in hex)  Protocol

   Data

      The Data field is zero or more octets, and contains additional
      data as determined by the particular protocol.



6.3.  Quality-Protocol

   Description

      On some links it may be desirable to determine when, and how
      often, the link is dropping data.  This process is called link
      quality monitoring.

      This Configuration Option provides a method to negotiate the use
      of a specific protocol for link quality monitoring.  By default,
      link quality monitoring is disabled.

      The implementation sending the Configure-Request is indicating
      that it expects to receive monitoring information from its peer.
      If an implementation sends a Configure-Ack, then it is agreeing to
      send the specified protocol.  An implementation receiving a
      Configure-Ack SHOULD expect the peer to send the acknowledged
      protocol.

      There is no requirement that quality monitoring be full-duplex or

      that the same protocol be used in both directions.  It is

6.4.  Magic-Number

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a method to detect looped-back
      links and other Data Link Layer anomalies.  This Configuration
      Option MAY be required by some other Configuration Options such as
      the Quality-Protocol Configuration Option.  By default, the
      Magic-Number is not negotiated, and zero is inserted where a
      Magic-Number might otherwise be used.

      Before this Configuration Option is requested, an implementation
      MUST choose its Magic-Number.  It is recommended that the Magic-
      Number be chosen in the most random manner possible in order to
      guarantee with very high probability that an implementation will
      arrive at a unique number.  A good way to choose a unique random
      number is to start with a unique seed.  Suggested sources of
      uniqueness include machine serial numbers, other network hardware
      addresses, time-of-day clocks, etc.  Particularly good random
      number seeds are precise measurements of the inter-arrival time of
      physical events such as packet reception on other connected
      networks, server response time, or the typing rate of a human
      user.  It is also suggested that as many sources as possible be
      used simultaneously.

      When a Configure-Request is received with a Magic-Number
      Configuration Option, the received Magic-Number is compared with
      the Magic-Number of the last Configure-Request sent to the peer.
      If the two Magic-Numbers are different, then the link is not
      looped-back, and the Magic-Number SHOULD be acknowledged.  If the
      two Magic-Numbers are equal, then it is possible, but not certain,
      that the link is looped-back and that this Configure-Request is
      actually the one last sent.  To determine this, a Configure-Nak
      MUST be sent specifying a different Magic-Number value.  A new
      Configure-Request SHOULD NOT be sent to the peer until normal
      processing would cause it to be sent (that is, until a Configure-
      Nak is received or the Restart timer runs out).

      Reception of a Configure-Nak with a Magic-Number different from
      that of the last Configure-Nak sent to the peer proves that a link
      is not looped-back, and indicates a unique Magic-Number.  If the
      Magic-Number is equal to the one sent in the last Configure-Nak,
      the possibility of a looped-back link is increased, and a new
      Magic-Number MUST be chosen.  In either case, a new Configure-
      Request SHOULD be sent with the new Magic-Number.

      If the link is indeed looped-back, this sequence (transmit
      Configure-Request, receive Configure-Request, transmit Configure-



Simpson                                                        [Page 45]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      Nak, receive Configure-Nak) will repeat over and over again.  If
      the link is not looped-back, this sequence might occur a few
      times, but it is extremely unlikely to occur repeatedly.  More
      likely, the Magic-Numbers chosen at either end will quickly
      diverge, terminating the sequence.  The following table shows the
      probability of collisions assuming that both ends of the link
      select Magic-Numbers with a perfectly uniform distribution:

         Number of Collisions        Probability
         --------------------   ---------------------
                 1              1/2**32    = 2.3 E-10
                 2              1/2**32**2 = 5.4 E-20
                 3              1/2**32**3 = 1.3 E-29


      Good sources of uniqueness or randomness are required for this
      divergence to occur.  If a good source of uniqueness cannot be
      found, it is recommended that this Configuration Option not be
      enabled; Configure-Requests with the option SHOULD NOT be
      transmitted and any Magic-Number Configuration Options which the
      peer sends SHOULD be either acknowledged or rejected.  In this
      case, looped-back links cannot be reliably detected by the
      implementation, although they may still be detectable by the peer.

      If an implementation does transmit a Configure-Request with a
      Magic-Number Configuration Option, then it MUST NOT respond with a
      Configure-Reject when it receives a Configure-Request with a
      Magic-Number Configuration Option.  That is, if an implementation
      desires to use Magic Numbers, then it MUST also allow its peer to
      do so.  If an implementation does receive a Configure-Reject in
      response to a Configure-Request, it can only mean that the link is
      not looped-back, and that its peer will not be using Magic-
      Numbers.  In this case, an implementation SHOULD act as if the
      negotiation had been successful (as if it had instead received a
      Configure-Ack).

      The Magic-Number also may be used to detect looped-back links
      during normal operation, as well as during Configuration Option
      negotiation.  All LCP Echo-Request, Echo-Reply, and Discard-
      Request packets have a Magic-Number field.  If Magic-Number has
      been successfully negotiated, an implementation MUST transmit
      these packets with the Magic-Number field set to its negotiated
      Magic-Number.

      The Magic-Number field of these packets SHOULD be inspected on
      reception.  All received Magic-Number fields MUST be equal to
      either zero or the peer's unique Magic-Number, depending on
      whether or not the peer negotiated a Magic-Number.



Simpson                                                        [Page 46]
RFC 1661                Point-to-Point Protocol                July 1994


      Reception of a Magic-Number field equal to the negotiated local
      Magic-Number indicates a looped-back link.  Reception of a Magic-
      Number other than the negotiated local Magic-Number, the peer's
      negotiated Magic-Number, or zero if the peer didn't negotiate one,
      indicates a link which has been (mis)configured for communications
      with a different peer.

      Procedures for recovery from either case are unspecified, and may
      vary from implementation to implementation.  A somewhat
      pessimistic procedure is to assume a LCP Down event.  A further
      Open event will begin the process of re-establishing the link,
      which can't complete until the looped-back condition is
      terminated, and Magic-Numbers are successfully negotiated.  A more
      optimistic procedure (in the case of a looped-back link) is to
      begin transmitting LCP Echo-Request packets until an appropriate
      Echo-Reply is received, indicating a termination of the looped-
      back condition.

6.5.  Protocol-Field-Compression (PFC)

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a method to negotiate the
      compression of the PPP Protocol field.  By default, all
      implementations MUST transmit packets with two octet PPP Protocol
      fields.

      PPP Protocol field numbers are chosen such that some values may be
      compressed into a single octet form which is clearly
      distinguishable from the two octet form.  This Configuration
      Option is sent to inform the peer that the implementation can
      receive such single octet Protocol fields.

      As previously mentioned, the Protocol field uses an extension
      mechanism consistent with the ISO 3309 extension mechanism for the
      Address field; the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of each octet is
      used to indicate extension of the Protocol field.  A binary "0" as
      the LSB indicates that the Protocol field continues with the
      following octet.  The presence of a binary "1" as the LSB marks
      the last octet of the Protocol field.  Notice that any number of
      "0" octets may be prepended to the field, and will still indicate
      the same value (consider the two binary representations for 3,
      00000011 and 00000000 00000011).

      When using low speed links, it is desirable to conserve bandwidth
      by sending as little redundant data as possible.  The Protocol-
      Field-Compression Configuration Option allows a trade-off between
      implementation simplicity and bandwidth efficiency.  If
      successfully negotiated, the ISO 3309 extension mechanism may be
      used to compress the Protocol field to one octet instead of two.
      The large majority of packets are compressible since data
      protocols are typically assigned with Protocol field values less
      than 256.

      Compressed Protocol fields MUST NOT be transmitted unless this
      Configuration Option has been negotiated.  When negotiated, PPP
      implementations MUST accept PPP packets with either double-octet
      or single-octet Protocol fields, and MUST NOT distinguish between
      them.

      The Protocol field is never compressed when sending any LCP
      packet.  This rule guarantees unambiguous recognition of LCP
      packets.

      When a Protocol field is compressed, the Data Link Layer FCS field
      is calculated on the compressed frame, not the original

6.6.  Address-and-Control-Field-Compression (ACFC)

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a method to negotiate the
      compression of the Data Link Layer Address and Control fields.  By
      default, all implementations MUST transmit frames with Address and
      Control fields appropriate to the link framing.

      Since these fields usually have constant values for point-to-point
      links, they are easily compressed.  This Configuration Option is
      sent to inform the peer that the implementation can receive
      compressed Address and Control fields.

      If a compressed frame is received when Address-and-Control-Field-
      Compression has not been negotiated, the implementation MAY
      silently discard the frame.

      The Address and Control fields MUST NOT be compressed when sending
      any LCP packet.  This rule guarantees unambiguous recognition of
      LCP packets.

      When the Address and Control fields are compressed, the Data Link
      Layer FCS field is calculated on the compressed frame, not the
      original uncompressed frame.

   A summary of the Address-and-Control-Field-Compression configuration
   option format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left
   to right.

Tools needed These are the items we need for TCR in the XDK launcher: Cert_1.0-1-11 (removes all system files, soundtracks, etc) This option removes all system files. These include: Soundtracks Nicknames Cert_1.0-2-1 (fragments tdata \ udata) This option fragments the Tdata and Udata (Title and User data). It basically works like this: move all or a portion of the tdata files to a utility partition full the free space in the tdata area with small files for each file saved to the utility partition, delete a random collection of the small files in the tdata partition to free enough space to hold the file copy the file back from the utility partition repeat until there are no more files left to copy back do the same thing for any files in the tdata partition that you could not get the first time (since the utility partition is potentially smaller than the tdata) do the same thing for the udata partition Cert_1.0-2-2 (removes all soundtracks) Delete soundtracks, pretty self explanatory. Cert_1.0-2-7 (fills udata\<titleid>with 4096 entries) Create 4096 entries in the udata\titleid partition. Do this fast, probably with 0-length files, no need to have data in them. Cert_1.0-2-10 (clears utility drive\titleID) Delete all files in udata\titleid. Cert_1.0-2-18 (draws outline of non-HDTV safe area)  Draw 560x420 centered rectangle on the screen so the tester can outline this to determine the safe area. It should be 87.5% of the viewable area. We need to double check these numbers. Cert_1.0-2-19 (draws outline of HDTV safe area) Draw 608x456 centered rectangle (for 640x480) on the screen so the tester can outline this to determine the safe area. We need to determine the appropriate size for other HDTV resoulutions. Cert_1.0-3-2 (fills udata area, but with less than 4096 entries) This uses all space, but not all directory entries. Just fill udata quickly with a few files, they need no data, just lay them down with SetFilePointer(). Cert_1.0-3-3 (fills tdata area) This uses all space, but not all directory entries. Just fill tdata quickly with a few files, they need no data, just lay them down with SetFilePointer(). Cert_1.0-3-4 (fills tdata and udata area) This uses all space, but not all directory entries. Just fill udata and tdata () quickly with a few files, they need no data, just lay them down with SetFilePointer(). Cert_1.0-3-7 (check saved game signature) This option checks the signature of a saved game I have no idea how this works (at the moment), but you basically do it like this; input the title ID of the title input the Key the game uses to produce the signature navigate to the games, click on them to try the validation function Cert_1.0-3-11 (lists available blocks for all attached memory devices) This should just create a list of the available blocks for each device Cert_1.0-3-14 (change language setting) Change the language setting. Cert_1.0-3-15 (change time zone setting) Change the time zone setting. Cert_1.0-3-26 (creates saved games, nicknames, MU and soundtrack names with localized text) To test that titles correctly display undisplayable characters, create saved games, nicknames, MU names, soundtracks using localized text. For saved games, you ll need to: input the title ID of the title input the Key the game uses to produce the signature make a saved game with the correct signature and some localized text For the rest, these are not title specific, so just make them in the correct place Cert_1.0-3-33 (makes list of all files on console, both hard disk and MUs) Create a list of all files on all devices, save it to the disk. This will be copied over and examined. Make sure to include dates, times, sizes. Cert_1.0-3-34 (list all global settings) Dump all global settings from the EEPROM. Other tools for TCR: Imagebld   needs to be modified to dump the library versions from an image Debugger macros: Most will take the form of: bp xboxkrnl!NtCreateFile "dt OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES poi(esp+0xc);g" this will dump params to the functions we wish to monitor, they end up in a debugger log file. I ll figure out if I can get them in from a command line, I think this is possible debugger extensions: We need 1 to dump all the bus speed info so we can see if the app has changed it, the tester will need to break in every once and a while and check. We ll make this a post-RTM work item, Yasser Asmi is probably the right guy to do this. Debugger Output Scanner The logs created by the debugger can be manually read, or we can write a tool to scan them. This will be easy and is low-priority. Netmon, possibly modified to look at our packets. Imaging tool to get the tape image onto the DVD Simulators This is being handled by Adam Green. Certification Kernel So far, the only thing we may do is remap some PCI data to move the addresses of devices we are concerned about (right now, only the IDE controller) so that direct access to this device will cause a failure we can detect and fail a tile for. Tactics Database For each title submitted for certification, a record of all test variations attempted will be kept, and a summary report from these tests, along with a PASS or FAIL status, will be generated and passed to the next team in the release process. Deliverables Launcher List of Certification test cases derived from Tactics database so title developers can pre-test their titles before submission. gd0Ek gd0Ek

This includes TCP, IP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, multicasting, DHCP, Autonet and Static IPs. This plan does not cover Winsock, Wininet, DirectPlay, or DNS testing. Three Ways of Testing Private (non-exported) API parameter checking Testing of actual TCPIP functionality (sending frames, receiving frames, and responding to other devices on the net) IP Address assignment Scenario tests.  This includes infrastructure such as: 10mbit vs 100mbit vs. DSL vs. Cable Modem, NAT/ICS testing. Note: There are no exported APIs from this layer of the networking stack.  The closest way that ISVs get to these APIs is via Sockets APIs. The first will be relatively easy and will get additional coverage by the Winsock, Wininet, and DirectPlay APIs. The second and third piece requires having a Windows 2000 machine to act as another device on the network and interoperate with an Xbox console (and may require the NetMon sniffer utility). Spec reviews Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? There are currently no design specifications.  However the code is based on the Windows 2000 TCPIP stack.  Tools needed Code coverage We are talking with MSR about getting ICECap modified for us to use for Code Coverage analysis.  All code will get this type of analysis. We may also use BBCover/Sleuth for this analysis. Static analysis All code will be statically analyzed with PC-Lint, Typo.pl, and PreFix.  Leak testing All code relating to storage will be checked for this. It will be done through a combination of running the tests / measuring / repeat. Look at   HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs\\leaks.doc"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs\leaks.doc  for notes on the how s and why s of leak checking. Corruption testing This will be done with the Driver Verifier (  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs\\verifier.doc"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs\verifier.doc ) as well as extensive manual tests.

Some of these tools need to be modified for Xbox Performance testing   we will have a special version of   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/performance/IceCAP/"  IceCAP  for Xbox from   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/"   to measure performance Code coverage   IceCAP will be used to measure the code coverage. The goal is to cover at least 80% of memory manager code. Special fault injection technique will be used to achieve this number Fault Injection   HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/reliability/Injector/"  Injector  will be used to inject faults for some code paths that is hard to cover Static analysis -  HYPERLINK "http://msrweb/pprc/reliability/prefix/" PREfix , TYPO.PL, and PC-Lint will be used regularly  Leak testing   this will be done through a combination of running the tests, measuring, and repeat. See  HYPERLINK "\\\\cpitgcfs01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs\\leaks.doc" leaks.doc  for more information on leak testing. Corruption testing   this will be done using the driver verifier and fault injector Hardware needed For the beginning, a regular PC will be enough. After that we will need real Xbox machine to measure real performance. We also need at least 3-5 target machines in lab to run long-haul stress for leak and corruption testing. Test methods Test code What needs to be written? Basic threading APIs Stress test What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? Can your code go into a stress test?

Developing Windows 2000 kernel mode components is a complicated task where even the slightest error can cause system corruption and crashes.  Clearly an automated method to apply directed pressure and conclusively test a system component is needed. After the development phase concludes, the second part of the problem is at the customer site.  When the system crashes here, information needs to be quickly extracted from it and the cause accurately determined.  The customer has no idea whether Windows 2000 crashed due to a flaw in Windows 2000 itself or due to a flaw in some third party product that was installed.  Developing an automated method for quickly identifying the component responsible for the crash is absolutely a requirement for Windows 2000 to succeed in the enterprise space. An automated tool that solves the above problems could be employed by developers, testers, certification suites and customers/customer support in a wide variety of scenarios. for AGP in NT5 requires changes to a number of system components. AGP is really an extension to the PCI bus, not a bus itself. Knowledge of AGP could be built directly into the existing PCI driver, but this would require support for multiple incompatible AGP implementations and significant modifications to the base PCI driver as more chipset implementations emerge. Instead, AGP functionality will be added to the PCI driver by implementing a bus filter driver that sits on top of PCI. This filter driver will be chipset-specific. In order to make development easier for IHVs, Microsoft will supply common code for implementing the filter driver and interfacing with the NT kernel and I/O system. IHVs will be able to easily integrate this code with their chipset-specific code to create a complete filter driver.We worked with PSS to analyze the root causes of Windows 2000 crashes/hangs.  We reviewed existing internal and customer reliability data. We met customers with high availability requirements.  We developed the event log analyst tool to collect and analyze reliability data from Windows 2000 event logs, which provides a methodology for measuring and comparing reliability data across multiple Windows 2000 sites.  800 internal servers and 1300 customer servers were measured, with every system crash being recorded. The Driver Verifier is an automated tool based on the information we gained from the project above. Note that in order to meet the requirement that this tool be suitable for real-world customer and support usage, various features can be enabled/disabled so that the overhead is negligible. Driver Verifier Capabilities Note that enabling of the Driver Verifier simply involves adding a registry entry and a reboot.  No recompilation or other changes are needed to any driver you wish to analyze.  The Driver Verifier can be enabled on free or checked systems. The Driver Verifier currently provides the following capabilities (which can be enabled or disabled via the registry): Attempt to allocate all of a driver s pool allocations from special pool.  What this means is that instead of sharing pool allocations with the rest of the system, this driver s allocations are isolated and bounded by NO ACCESS permissions.  This quickly ascertains whether a driver allocates n bytes and accesses n+1.  This also catches a driver who allocates n bytes, frees the allocation and then accesses the allocation.  These two very common problems are the root of many crashes where the core Windows 2000 system is left holding the bag long after the driver has left the scene of the corruption.  Provided the target machine has enough physical and virtual memory, all of the driver s allocations will be automatically redirected into special pool. Provide extreme memory pressure on a specific driver without affecting other drivers and regardless of system memory size.  This is accomplished by instructing memory management to invalidate all of  the driver s pageable code and data as well as system paged pool, code and data.  This catches driver that incorrectly hold spinlocks or raise IRQL and then access paged code or data.  Instead of these problems only showing up under memory pressure once every few months, these are systematically triggered immediately. All spinlock, IRQL and pool allocation calls made by the driver receive automatic parameter validation.  This means that checks are made to ensure: A raise IRQL really is a raise (ie: the current IRQL is less than the target IRQL). A lower IRQL really is a lower IRQL. Double release of a spinlock. Spinlock acquisitions/releases are made at the proper IRQL. Paged pool allocations/frees are made at the correct IRQL (APC_LEVEL or below). Nonpaged pool allocations/frees are made at the correct IRQL (DISPATCH_LEVEL or below). No random (uninitialized) values are specified to these APIs. Pool allocation injection failures : Pool allocations which are not marked MUST_SUCCEED by the driver can be randomly failed to ensure the driver can handle this low memory situation correctly. All pool being freed is examined to ensure no pending timers are inside the pool allocation as these cases would cause extremely hard to track down system crashes. Pool leakage detection : All of the driver s pool allocations are automatically tracked.  At driver unload time, a bugcheck will occur if any of the allocations have not been freed.  The developer can then use the !verifier 3 kernel debugger command to show all the allocations that have not been freed.  Note this command can be used even prior to unload to see what allocations the driver has outstanding at any point in time. Driver unload checking is done to catch drivers that unload forgetting to delete lookaside lists, pending DPCs, worker threads, queues, timers and other resources that are guaranteed to cause a system bugcheck shortly after the driver disappears. I/O Verifier. If the I/O verifier flag is turned on through the verifier applet or through  the VerifyDriverLevel registry key, some IO manager verifications are turned on.  This includes Notably,: All IRPS allocated through IoAllocateIrp are allocated from special pool. Some cChecks are made in IoCallDriver, IoCompleteRequest and IoFreeIrp to catch the driver s errorsinconsistent behavior. All I/O verifier failures bugcheck with the code  DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION (0xC9). PCI / AGP interfaceDriver Verifier Requirements Figure 1 describes the layout of the PCI devices and bridges in the Intel 440LX chipset. Note that the host PCI bridge appears as a device on the root PCI bus (identifier 8086-7180). This device contains the PCIThe only requirement at this point is Windows 2000, Build 1933 (free or checked) or later. configuration registers and BARs that control AGP. Since it controls the AGP functionality, this is a natural place to attach the AGP miniport driver. But this device is not a parent of anything in the NT device tree. It shows up as just another device on the root PCI bus. So getting this device to communicate with the AGP video card involves jumping through a lot of hoops. There is also no requirement that AGP registers must be in the host-PCI bridge and other implementations may put their AGP control registers in different locations.   Since AGP really needs to be a parent of  the video device, the AGP driver will load as an upper filter for the PCI-PCI bridge (identifier 8086-7181). The normal interfaces provided by PCI will allow the AGP filter easy access to any AGP registers in PCI config space for the PCI-PCI bridge. Unfortunately, since many of the AGP registers are actually located in the host-PCI bridge, there is no easy way to get access to these registers through the preferred PnP mechanisms. Instead, the AGP filter will have to use the old HalGet/SetBusData interface to access these registers. Since the location of these registers is chipset-specific, there is no any standard way for PCI to expose them. The AGP miniport will be responsible for locating the device containing these registers and determining the correct bus and slot ids.  By loading as a filter on the PCI-PCI bridge, AGP will be able to intercept IRP_MN_FILTER_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS IRPs sent to the PCI-PCI bridge. After the bridge has filled in its standard PCI resource requirements, AGP will add on the resource requirements for the AGP physical memory aperture and any additional AGP-specific resource requirements. It will also intercept the IRP_MN_START_DEVICE to filter out the AGP-specific resource requirements and program the GART appropriately. How to enable the Driver Verifier The preferred method is to use verifier.exe (this is shipped with every copy of Windows 2000 and automatically installed into the system32 directory).  This application has both a command line and GUI interface that allows you to specify drivers to verify and various levels of verification as desired.  It also shows the driver verifier statistics in real-time. See section 7   The Driver Verifier Manager - for more details. The other (less-user-friendly) method is as follows : Using a registry editor (ie: regedt32), edit the REG_SZ key  HYPERLINK \\\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session  \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session  Manager\Memory Management\VerifyDrivers Set this key to the case-insensitive name(s) of the driver(s) you want to test.  Multiple drivers can be specified, but using only one driver is recommended in order to best ensure that available system resources are not prematurely depleted.  Premature depletion of resources will not result in any system reliability problems but can cause the bypassing of some driver checking due to lack of resources. Examples of values for the key above would be: Ntfs.sys Win32k.sys ftdisk.sys *.sys The level of driver verification can be specified in the REG_DWORD key below:  HYPERLINK \\\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session  \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session  Manager\Memory Management\VerifyDriverLevel The bitfield values for this key (which can be freely combined) are: Attempt to satisfy all allocations from special pool Apply memory pressure to this driver to validate IRQL usage in regards to accessing pagable code and data. Randomly fail various pool allocation requests.  Note this is only done after the system has booted to a point so these failures can be treated as reasonable situations that must be handled. Enable pool allocation tracking.  Every allocation must be freed before the driver unloads or the system will bugcheck. Enable the I/O verifier (see section   REF _Ref443114822 \r \h  The default value is 3 if the key does not exist or no level of driver verification is specified.  Debugging Driver Verifier Violations Both the !verifier command in the kernel debugger and the verifier.exe user application show the current driver verifier configuration and statistics in real time. All driver verifier violations result in bugchecks, the most common ones (although not necessarily all of them) are: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION DRIVER_CAUGHT_MODIFYING_FREED_POOL TIMER_OR_DPC_INVALID DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION Driver Verifier and Graphics Drivers Windows 2000 kernel-mode graphics drivers (such as printer and display driver DLLs) are restricted from calling the pool entry point directly.  Rather, pool allocations are done indirectly via graphics DDI (device driver interface) callbacks to win32k.sys.  For example, EngAllocMem is the callback that a graphics driver would call to explicitly allocate pool memory.  Also, other specialized callbacks such as EngCreatePalette and EngCreateBitmap return pool memory as well. To provide the same sort of automated testing for the graphics drivers, support for some of the Driver Verifier functions have been incorporated into win32k.sys.  However, because graphics drivers are more restricted than other kernel-mode drivers, they require only a subset of the Driver Verifier functionality.  Specifically, IRQL checking and I/O verification are not needed.  The other functionality, namely using special pool, random failure of pool allocations, and pool tracking, are supported to varying degrees in the different graphics DDI callbacks. Random failures are supported for the following graphics DDI callback functions: EngAllocMem EngAllocUserMem EngCreateBitmap EngCreateDeviceSurface EngCreateDeviceBitmap EngCreatePalette EngCreateClip EngCreatePath EngCreateWnd EngCreateDriverObj BRUSHOBJ_pvAllocRbrush CLIPOBJ_ppoGetPath In addition, using special pool and pool tracking are supported for EngAllocMem. Enabling Driver Verifier for the graphics drivers is identical to the other drivers (see Section 4   How to enable the Driver Verifier).  Unsupported flags such as IRQL checking will be ignored.  In addition, !gdikdx.verifier kernel debugger command can help to examine current Driver Verifier state and pool traces for graphics drivers. Note that the random allocation failure setting should only be used for robustness testing.  This setting may cause rendering errors.  Therefore, it should not be used with verification tests check the correctness of the graphics driver's implementation (for example, by comparing the graphics driver output to a reference image). The Driver Verifier Manager (verifier.exe)DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION (0xC9) The Driver Verifier Manager application (verifier.exe) is the preferred way to create and modify driver verifier settings and to gather statistics from the driver verifier. The application is in %windir%\system32 for every Windows 2000 installation. Driver Status The Driver Status property page gives you an image of the current status of the driver verifier. The user can see in the list what are the drivers the verifier is aware of. The status can be one of the following: Loaded   the driver is loaded and verified right now; Unloaded   the driver is not loaded now but it has been loaded at least once since reboot; Never Loaded   the driver was never loaded. This can be a hint that the driver s image file is corrupted or that the user specified a driver name that is missing from the system. The list can be sorted by the driver names or by their status by clicking on the list header. In the upper-right zone of the dialog you can view what are the current types of the verification that are in effect. The status of the drivers is updated automatically if the user does not switch to manual refresh mode. You can modify the refresh rate using the bottom-left radio buttons. The user can also force an update of the status with a click on the Update Now button. If you have the Special Pool flag enabled and less than 95% of the pool allocations went to the special pool you will see a warning message on this page. This means that you need to select a smaller set of drivers to verify or add more physical memory to the machine to get a better coverage of the pool allocations verification. Global Counters The Global Counters property page shows the current value of some counters maintained by the driver verifier (see section 7.3 - Pool Tracking - for per-driver counters).  A zero value of a counter can be an indication that the associated driver verifier flag is not enabled. For instance, if the counter Other/Faults injected is zero this is an indication that the low resource simulation flag is not enabled. The user can monitor the activity of the verifier since the values of the counters are updated automatically (by default). You can change the refresh rate, switch to manual refresh or force a refresh using the bottom-left group of controls.  Pool Tracking This property page shows more statistics gathered from the driver verifier. All of the counters shown on this page are related to the pool tracking flag of the verifier. Most of them are per-driver counters (E.g. current allocations, current allocated bytes, etc.) This means you must select a driver s name from the top combo-box and you will see the counters for that specific driver.  Settings This page can be used to create and modify driver verifier settings. The settings are saved in the registry and you must restart the computer for the settings to take effect. The user can use the list to view what are the currently installed drivers in the system. Each driver can be in four possible states: Verify Enabled   the driver is currently verified. Verify Disabled   the driver is currently NOT verified. Verify Enabled (Reboot Needed)   the driver will be verified only after the next reboot. Verify Disabled (Reboot Needed)   the driver is currently verified but will NOT be verified after the next reboot. The user can select one or several drivers from the list and switch the status using the two buttons under the list.  One can also right-click the drivers  names and a contextual menu will popup, allowing state toggling.  The user can specify in the bottom edit additional drivers to be verified after next reboot, separated by spaces. The typical usage of this edit control is when the user wants to install a new driver that is not loaded already. Obviously such a driver will not be in the Drivers currently active in the system list.  If the radio buttons group on the top of the list is set to Verify all drivers then the list plus the Verify and Don t Verify buttons and the edit control are grayed. This means that after the next reboot, all the drivers in the system will be verified.  The verification type can be set using the check-boxes in the upper-right zone. The I/O verification can be enabled at level 1 or at level 2. Level 2 verification is stronger than level 1. Any modification in the settings must be saved with the Apply button before it can be taken in consideration.  There are two more buttons in this page: Preferred Settings   this will select some common used settings (with all drivers verified); Reset All   this will clear all the driver verifier settings so that no drivers will be verified. After committing the changes with the Apply button the system must be rebooted so that the changes to take effect. Volatile Settings This property page can be used to change the driver verifier flags on the fly. You can only toggle the state of some of the driver verifier flags and you cannot change the list of the drivers that are being verified. After you change the status of some check-boxes you must click the Apply button to make the changes effective. The changes take effect immediately and they last until they are changed again or the system is rebooted. The command line interface The application can operate in command line too. Please see  verifier.exe /?  for more information. The commonly used command line flags are: Verifier.exe /flags VALUE [/iolevel 2]   specify a decimal value of the driver verifier flags and possibly the level for the IO verification  (See  verifier.exe /?  or section 4 - How to enable the Driver Verifier - for a list of the available flags); Verifier.exe /all   verify all the drivers in the system; Verifier.exe /volatile /flags VALUE   change verifier flags on the fly; Verifier.exe /reset   erase all the current driver verifier settings; Verifier /query   dump the current driver verifier status and counters to the standard output; Verifier.exe /log LOG_FILE_NAME [/interval SECONDS]   log the driver verifier status and counters to a log file with SECONDS as the period of time. Future The Driver Verifier is a foundation for adding more and more features as time goes on.  The intent is to make it easier for driver writers to validate their products, for Windows 2000 systems to run much more reliably and to provide an easy definitive way to troubleshoot problems when they do occur. Special IRP verification is an example of a feature that will be added shortly. More IO manager verifier functionality is planned for the future. Boot and Initialization The boot process is unchanged except for an addition to the INF file and a new driver, AGPxxx.SYS (AGP440.SYS for a 440LX). The INF declares the AGP driver to be an upper filter for the PCI-PCI bridge (VEN_8086&DEV_7181). The PnP Manager will now load AGP440.SYS and it will attach to the PDO for the PCI-PCI bridge. Once AGP is attached, it will filter the following IRPs: IRP_MN_QUERY_RESOURCES   Add current AGP-specific resources after PCI has returned standard PCI-PCI resources. IRP_MN_FILTER_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS   Add AGP-specific resource requirements after PCI has determined the standard PCI-PCI bridge resource requirements. IRP_MN_START_DEVICE   Program GART and any AGP-specific resources to match resource requirements, strip off AGP-specific resources. IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE   Disable GART and release any AGP-specific resources. This assumes that video driver will fail any stop request if it has memory allocated in the GART. AGP should never get a stop if there is any memory committed. IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS   AGP uses this to attach an AGP filter device to all children of the PCI-PCI bus. (see   REF _Ref402343481 \h  Video Port / AGP interface IRP_MN_SET_POWER   Reinitialize GART registers when waking from D3 Video Port / AGP interface The video port driver uses AGP by calling functions in the AGP_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface provided by its parent PDO. Since the AGP filter originally attached to the PDO of the PCI-PCI bridge, and not the video driver s PDO, the AGP filter will also attach a filter device to all the child PDOs of the PCI-PCI bridge. This AGP filter device handles only the IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE IRP. The AGP_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface supports the following methods: ReserveMemory   Finds and reserves contiguous physical address space mapped by the GART. Flags specify whether the memory will be uncached or write-combined ReleaseMemory   Releases contiguous physical address space reserved by ReserveMemory CommitMemory   Assigns physical memory pages to the GART space previously reserved by ReserveMemory. FreeMemory   Frees physical memory pages currently added to the GART by CommitMemory. GetMappedPages   Returns a MDL for a portion of a commited region. Note that the AGP memory allocation mechanism explicitly does not use any of the PnP arbitration mechanisms. This is because of the following assumptions All AGP memory of the same type is equivalent (no such thing as  preferred  allocation) Users of AGP memory are user apps, therefore rebalancing is not feasible, The current PnP interfaces are not well-suited to dynamic allocate/free resource usage patterns. Allocation policies for AGP memory are expected to be very different than the normal arbitration policies. (i.e. all write-combined memory should be allocated in a contiguous chunk so it consumes only a single MTRR) If any of the above assumptions change, this decision may be revisited without changing the AGP miniport. The AGP driver always returns only physical addresses to the video driver. Some devices may have special requirements on the physical memory that is usable, so AGP always allocates and frees any physical memory pages. The AGP driver uses the new MM service MmAllocatePagesForMdl to obtain a list of free physical pages. The video driver is responsible for mapping these physical addresses into virtual space. The virtual addresses may be either user or kernel space as required.  Future AGP chipsets will not allow the processor access to GART-mapped memory, so video port will need to map the MDL rather than the physical GART address. The NT5 Memory Manager has a new interface, MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache, for this purpose. The Capabilities field in the AGP_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD structure will have a bit defined to indicate to video port whether the physical address returned from CommitMemory can be used from the processor. The video driver is responsible for looking at the characteristics returned from the AGP interface and then using the appropriate MM call to map the physical memory. If the AGP chipset supports processor access through the GART, the existing MmMapIoSpace/ZwMapViewOfSection calls should be used. If not, the new MM routine MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache should be used. DirectX / Video Port interface  who knows what they are doing? Interface Specifications New Base Services KeFlushDcacheMdl( IN PMDL MemoryDescriptorList Routine Description: This function flushes the specified physical pages from the CPU caches on all processors in the system. Arguments: MemoryDescriptorList - Supplies a valid Memory Descriptor List  Return Value: PVOID MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache ( IN PMDL MemoryDescriptorList, IN KPROCESSOR_MODE AccessMode, IN MEMORY_CACHING_TYPE CacheType Routine Description: This function maps physical pages described by a memory descriptor list into the system virtual address space or the user portion of the virtual address space. Arguments: MemoryDescriptorList - Supplies a valid Memory Descriptor List which has been updated by MmProbeAndLockPages. AccessMode - Supplies an indicator of where to map the pages; KernelMode indicates that the pages should be mapped in the system part of the address space, UserMode indicates the pages should be mapped in the user part of the address space. CacheType - Supplies the type of cache mapping to use for the MDL.  MmCached indicates "normal" kernel or user mappings. Return Value: Returns the base address where the pages are mapped.  The base address has the same offset as the virtual address in the MDL. This routine will raise an exception if the processor mode is USER_MODE and quota limits or VM limits are exceeded. MmAllocatePagesForMdl ( IN PHYSICAL_ADDRESS LowAddress, IN PHYSICAL_ADDRESS HighAddress, IN PHYSICAL_ADDRESS SkipBytes, IN ULONG TotalBytes Routine Description: This routine searches the PFN database for contiguous free, zeroed, or standby pages to satisfy the request.  This does not map the pages - it just allocates them and puts them into an MDL.  It is expected that our caller will map the MDL as needed. NOTE: this routine may return an MDL mapping a smaller number of bytes than the amount requested.  It is the caller's responsibility to check the MDL upon return for the size actually allocated. These pages comprise physical non-paged memory and are zero-filled. This routine is designed to be used by an AGP driver to obtain physical memory in a specified range since hardware may provide substantial performance wins depending on where the backing memory is allocated. Arguments: LowAddress - Supplies the low physical address of the first range that the allocated pages can come from. HighAddress - Supplies the high physical address of the first range that the allocated pages can come from. SkipBytes - Number of bytes to skip (from the Low Address) to get to the next physical address range that allocated pages can come from. TotalBytes - Supplies the number of bytes to allocate. Return Value: MDL - an MDL mapping a range of pages in the specified range.  This may map less memory than the caller requested if the full amount is not currently available. NULL - No pages in the specified range are available at this time. AGPLIB Services Microsoft will provide a common library (AGPLIB) for use in creating AGP filter drivers. This library will handle all the common AGP tasks, interfacing with the NT kernel and I/O system, and general unpleasantness associated with being a real filter driver. We will make source for this library available, but it is expected that most AGP drivers will not need to change it. Below are the entrypoints that AGPLIB will use for chipset-specific tasks. NTSTATUS AgpInitializeTarget( IN PVOID AgpContext Routine Description: This routine will be called once for each AGP target (AGP bridge) in the system.

This is for private use of the chipset-specific code. Return Value: STATUS_SUCCESS if successful NT status code otherwise. NTSTATUS AgpReleaseMemory( IN PVOID AgpContext, IN PAGP_RANGE Range Routine Description: AGPLIB calls this routine to release physical address space in the current AGP physical memory aperture.

OffsetInPages   Supplies the offset into the reserved range where the memory to be mapped should start MemoryBase   Returns the physical address in the aperture where the memory was mapped. Return Value: STATUS_SUCCESS if successful NT status code otherwise. NTSTATUS AgpUnMapMemory( IN PVOID AgpContext, IN PAGP_RANGE Range, IN ULONG NumberOfPages, IN ULONG PageOffsetInPages, Routine Description: AGPLIB calls this routine to unmap physical memory that has been mapped into the current AGP physical memory aperture.

AgpFlushPages( IN PVOID AgpContext, IN PMDL Mdl Routine Description: This routine is an optional function pointer. If initialized to a valid function (not NULL), it indicates the chipset has the ability to flush pages from the CPU cache. If the AGP miniport sets this to NULL, the PCI driver will flush the CPU cache itself. This routine will be called once and must flush the specified pages from the processor caches on all processors in the system. If this routine is not supported, AGPLIB will flush the caches on all processors by calling the kernel. On x86 systems, the kernel will use the WBINVD instruction. On Alpha machines, the kernel will call KeFlushDcache. Note that this is currently a NOP and Digital will have to figure out how to implement this. It may be useful to add a new routine to the Alpha HALs which flushes an MDL rather than the entire cache.

Pointer to a pre-allocated MDL large enough to hold the list of pages returned. Return Value: STATUS_SUCCESS if successful NT status code otherwise. Open Issues MP synchronization required   if the GART is changing, the other processors probably need to be captured until the change is complete. Also need to understand the L1/L2 flushing and the HW capabilities. Growing/shrinking GART on the fly   punted for NT5 More info on MTRR usage, etc. Win9x interface allows you to map pages to replace ones that are already mapped. Not sure why this is necessary and seems like it would complicate the bookkeeping. Also allows for unmapping pages that aren t mapped which also seems unnecessary (and likely to hide bugs).

Which includes device enumeration and communication. This test plan does not cover bulk transfers which are covered in the MU Test plan (xcardtesting.doc). Three Ways of Testing APIs called by games APIs called by USB device drivers Testing of actual USB IO The first two will be relatively easy and will get additional coverage by actual developers (e.g. our Duke controller). The third piece requires extra hardware and software (called the XID Simulator in this doc)   of which none currently exists for testing our flavor of USB. Spec reviews Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? There are currently no design specifications and two architecture specs. The first dev spec is the USB Base Driver Architecture document, which the author admits is slightly out of date. The second is the XID Specification, which contains some open issues.  Tools needed Code coverage We are talking with MSR about getting ICECap modified for us to use for Code Coverage analysis.  All code will get this type of analysis. Static analysis All code will be statically analyzed with PC-Lint, Typo.pl, and PreFix.  Leak testing All code relating to storage will be checked for this. It will be done through a combination of running the tests / measuring / repeat. Look at leaks.doc (checked into   HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) for notes on the how s and why s of leak checking. Corruption testing This will be done with the Driver Verifier (  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) as well as extensive manual tests. Hardware needed What do you need immediately? USB Simulator Chief Plus USB Monitor Supported PC Game Controllers USB Hubs What will you need further on down the road? Duke Controllers (with memory units) What lab requirements do you have? Test methods Test code What needs to be written? A USB test environment will need to be written to provide API tests as well as a test bed for manual cases Scripts for the USB Simulator What can be borrowed / adapted? USB Tests used by NT team Manual tests If we can get a good USB Simulator solution many of the below tests can be automated. Boot Time Boot with no devices attached Boot with 1 device attached Boot with multiple devices attached Play Time Add first device Add second device Remove first device Add first and third device Controller Tests Verify different types of controllers Verify all buttons and range inputs work Verify controllers in all ports work Miscellaneous Plug in big hub with all devices installed to try and overrun device enumeration buffer Stress tests Data stress (Retrieving lots of data from XID Simulator) Plug stress (device enumeration) API stress Code reviews How often? For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship. Which Dev / PM will attend? If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security What impact on security does this feature have? Performance testing The USB specification allows for 90% of the bandwidth to isochronous transfers (if needed), which doesn t leave much for other types of transfers (including HID). To test device responsiveness, we need to flush the pipe with isochronous data as well as bulk transfer data and verify that a user is not locked out or views noticeable delays/skips in control feedback. (Though there are no isochronous devices for year 1). We also need to ensure that the required bandwidth percentages are met with this implementation of the USB driver. It is also important to address the performance metrics of device enumeration as well as how it affects IO performance. Catastrophic failure testing The following tests will attempt to gauge the stability of the USB driver under unusual circumstances. Alternate power supply (on hub or device) is turned off/on Device not inserted fully Sledgehammer and drowning of device Corruption to USB .sys files Power failure/surge/flicker to XBox Random acts of John Note that the hardware test team will cover some of these tests. Interfaces with other components The Memory Units will use USB Bulk transfers. Testing of this component is covered in the XCard test plan (xcardtesting.doc). Although it is necessary to run these XID tests while running MU tests to ensure there are no conflicts or errors that occur. Localization impact Test variations API Tests API tests for the XInput functions (xbox.h) will consist of the typical scenarios Valid inputs Invalid inputs Boundary cases Stress USB Simulator Tests These tests are assuming an ideal USB Simulator, if we don t get a good USB Simulator then these will become manual tests. Invalid inputs for different devices Invalid ranges Invalid (nonexistent) buttons Corrupted data packets Packets in wrong sequence Simulate EFT (Electric Fast Transient)  babble Stress Valid inputs for different (and multiple) devices Verify ranges on inputs Verify all buttons Stress Device enumeration (Insert and Remove) Different types of devices Stress Unsupported devices Many devices simultaneously Verify memory remains constant when adding/removing devices Verify bandwidth/scheduling is restored when devices are removed Max out the scheduler with devices and try to add more devices XID Tests Test boundaries on all packet fields (e.g. the bDescriptorType field in the Standard Device Descriptor packet) Test invalid values on packet fields Try to flood the Transfer Descriptor buffer by opening many endpoints on devices. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for this component to be declared  test complete Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? At first guess, all mainline cases, all failure cases, and most edge cases, the only exceptions agreed upon by a War Team or similar group. Which failures can we live with on this feature? Not many, these are core features. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When they all pass with exceptions as noted above. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Windows 2000 TitleWindows 2000 pranavk Normal Microsoft Word 9.0@F:\folders\docs\Duplicate IP Address Detection_files\dupeIP1.gifbjbjU Windows 2000 Test Plan  Duplicate IP Address Detection on broadcast media Microsoft Confidential Revision history: June 8, 1999 Pranav Kedia Added feedback from last week s meeting. Changes concern receipt of Gratuitous ARP from DHCP Host. June 1, 1999 Pranav Kedia Modified it and added feedback from JP. May 24, 1999 Pranav Kedia Created Duplicate IP Address Detection Overview TCP/IP implements duplicate IP address detection (a.k.a. Address Conflict Detection) on the broadcast media (Ethernet, Token Ring, ATM/LANE, etc.) at the ARP level (Layer 2). The detection occurs whenever ARP packet is received indicating that there's another host on the network with the same IP address. Such packets include: regular ARP request, ARP reply and two forms of gratuitous ARP. Implementation If two interfaces on different machines boot up at the same time, they send out gratuitous ARPs. A machine receiving gratuitous ARP after sending out one, realizes that it is a duplicate IP address and does not plumb the IP address. When an interface boots up, it broadcasts a gratuitous ARPs enquiring for address conflict. If another interface on the network has the same address, it responds back and the booting interface does not plumb the IP address. If an interface receives an ARP broadcast with the source IP address equal to IP address on the receiving interface, then the receiving machine detects address conflict. Test Tools Test environment:  Three machines,  clean installation multi home box   referred to as the test box or the first test box. machine running a variety of test programs   the control box. Single home box that listens to the traffic on the wire- the second test box Test programs:  1. Netmon 2. A program to generate different type of ARP packets. (may exist   see muppet/HAPI ?) For automation: t use netmon to manually verify activity, instead parse the netmon sniff. Create an automated tool to send/receive packets from control box (muppet/HAPI may do it). Write program to monitor popup messages and event log. Use Visual Test to change from DHCP to Static and viceversa. Note 1: There are 2 types of Gratuitous ARPs, one for static and one for DHCP address. For static Gratuitous ARP both the source and destination address are present. For DHCP gratuitous ARP, the source address is set to 0(NULL) and only the destination address is present. In whichever case possible, tests should be run with both types of ARPs. Note 2: If an interface on boot up detects that its IP address conflict its action differs, depending on the type of IP address: a) Static address (i.e. in use address): A message is popped up, an event logged and the IP address is not plumbed on the interface. b) DHCP address: The system asks DHCP server to mark the address as invalid and gets a new address. There is no popup or event log. Note 3: Ways of booting up an interface: There are four ways of booting up an interface The interface boots up on booting up the machine. The interface boots up on connecting after a disconnect (from the UI or by inserting a PCMCI card). The interface boots up on causing a media connect event after a media disconnect event. The interface boots up on causing a suspend followed by a resume: Bug here. Add an address to an interface (through UI or through IpHlpApi.). Tests  LISTNUM testlist \l 4 \s 1   Simultaneous boot (active-active) Shutdown the test machine s interface. Using a control box, broadcast gratuitous ARPs for the IP address of the test server at interval of one second. Boot up an interface on the same network as the control box on the test machine. The booting interface sends out a gratuitous ARP.  Result: The test box interface on receiving gratuitous ARP for the same IP address from the control box s interface, does not plumb the IP address on the interface.  Perform the test for the test box s interface having static and DHCP address. As described in notes above, for static one gets a popup message and event log. For DHCP the test box marks the old address as invalid and gets a new address, however there is no PopUp or event log message. Perform the above test for all the five modes of boot up for the test box s interface as described in notes 3 above: namely boot up the test box disconnect and connect the interface disconnect the cable and then connect it back suspend and resume the test box add duplicate IP address to interface. (2) Duplicate address joining the network (active-passive) (a) First Test box s interface is the active machine Shut down the first test box s interface (described in note 3 above). Run a test program on the control box such that it will respond to the gratuitous ARPs broadcast by the interface of the first test box, telling that the address is already in use. Add ARP entry in second test box having the IP address and mac address of the control box. In less than 2 minutes(ARP cache entry s life is just 2 minutes), boot up the first test box s interface. The interface sends out a gratuitous ARP. The control box s interface responds back with an ARP reply.  Result: The first test box s interface on receiving the ARP reply for the same IP address, does not plumb the IP address on the interface. The first test box s interface sends out a gratuitous ARP with the MAC address of the control box s interface to reset the ARP cache table of the second test box to point to the control box. Check the ARP cache of the second test box, such that it has the MAC address of the control box s interface in the ARP table for the IP address. Perform the test for first test box s interface having static and DHCP address. As described in notes above, for static one gets a popup message and event log. For DHCP the server marks the old address as invalid and gets a new address, however there is no PopUp or event log message. Perform the above test for all the four modes of boot up for the test box s interface as described in notes 3 above: namely boot up the test box disconnect and connect the interface disconnect the cable and then connect it back suspend and resume the test box add duplicate IP address to interface. (b) Test box is the passive machine Bring up test box s interface. Use the control box s interface to send out gratuitous ARPs, having the same address as the test box s interface. Result: the test box s interface should respond to the gratuitous ARPs, have popup message and log an event. Test with the control box s interface broadcasting both type of gratuitous ARPs (One for DHCP address and one for static address) as described in notes above. On receipt of gratuitous ARP for static address, the response should have both source as well as destination address. On receipt of gratuitous ARP for DHCP address (source address of gratuitous ARP is 0), the response from test box should have destination address 0. (3) Conflict during normal operation (passive-passive) Start test box. Configure control box s interface to broadcast ARP request packet giving source address equal to the IP address of the test box s interface and the target address equal to the address of a third (or non existent) machine.  Result: The test box has a popup message and an event log indicating an address conflict. Miscellaneous Registry Parameter validation HKLM\CCS\ \tcpip\parameters\ArpRetryCount: determines the number of times gratuitous ARP packet is broadcast. Configure this value to 0, 1, 5 to check that no gratuitous ARP is broadcast, one gratuitous ARP is broadcast per IP address and five gratuitous ARP is broadcast per IP address. b) Non ARP packet with duplicate address does not trigger duplicate IP address detection. Send a UDP packet to the test box with source IP address same as the IP address of the test box s interface IP address. The test box accepts the packet and does not trigger duplicate address detection. c) Number of gratuitous ARPs and the time interval between them. Boot up test box s interface. Check that it sends out three gratuitous ARPs with a time interval of one second between successive gratuitous ARPs. d) System deactivates only the conflicting address and not the whole interface Configure an interface of the test box, with multiple static IP address, such that one of the address is conflicting with the interface address of the control box. Boot up the interface on the test box. The server should have the popup message and event log as expected. It should disable only the conflicting IP address and bring up the interface with rest of the address. e) Internal conflicts on a multi-home box are discovered without resorting to ARP On the multi-home test box, try assigning the same IP address to couple of interfaces. The UI (or API) should detect the conflict internally, without sending out ARP packets. f) Non local conflict on a multi-home box are not detected  INCLUDEPICTURE  \d "F:\\folders\\docs\\Duplicate IP Address Detection_files\\dupeIP1.gif" \* MERGEFORMATINET  In the figure Above the machine Y is the test box and X is the control box. The interface on machine Y with IP address A, does not see the machine X. From the machine X (the control box) broadcast gratuitous ARPs for address A. The machine Y(test box) should not detect the IP address conflict. g) Addresses in active phase not used for communication The address in the active phase should not be used for communication or visible to the applications (invisible to Layer 3). The only acceptable use of the IP address in active phase is gratuitous ARP. Host in active phase for specific address should not respond to ARP requests for that address, or generate non-gratuitous ARP requests. Start sniffing the test box and then boot it up. Ensure that The test box does not send out any packet with the IP address except the gratuitous ARP packet till one second after the last gratuitous ARP broadcast. h) Address conflict detection for multiple addresses Add few thousand IP addresses to an interface on test box. Reboot the interface. Sniff to check that the machine sends out gratuitous ARPs for each address added ArpRetryCount times.

A custom USB device (called the USB Simulator in this document) will be used to simulate multiple XBox peripherals.  These  virtual devices  will be programmable and controlled through software on another computer, or the same XBox, (called the Controller in this document). The Simulator will act like a USB hub and must support multiple virtual devices, each with different capabilities. These virtual devices will support XID and bulk transfers. The actual devices will be operated in real-time via the controller through an Ethernet (TCP/IP communication) connection. So responses to USB commands from the Host will always come from the controller. Our current XBox hardware configuration will allow up to 5 simulators will be attached at the same time.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Sample Transaction Protocol Description Simulator IN packet Simulator Controller TCP/IP IN packet Controller Simulator TCP/IP DATA1 + 8bytes data  Simulator DATA1 + 8bytes data + CRC  Type of Tests The following is a short list of the types of tests that will be used to validate the XBox USB hardware and software. Device enumeration stress Data stress Testing the limits on the total number of connected devices XID packet tests (e.g. boundary cases on the different fields) MU testing (simulate memory cards on the controller) Isocronous tests (such as voice and audio) Invalid data (e.g. sending corrupted XID packets or bad responses during device enumeration) Functional Requirements This is the list of general functional requirements of the USB Simulator. Act like a hub Support at least seven devices Support for bulk transfer Support for Isocronous transfers Send all USB communication from the host to the controller Send USB responses from the controller back to the host Simulator Requirements Here is a list of hardware and software requirements on the simulator. USB connection Dongle to support XBox s USB connector USB Cable must be able to extend up to 8 feet and be robust with respect to noise immunity (braided shields, etc.) 100Mbit Ethernet connector Jumpers that configure the IP address Access to the electrical signals and power Breakout functions that allow probing of D+ and D- Ability to insert a different power supply TCP/UDP Server that listens on ports 200 and 201 Take care of the USB CRCs and ACK and NAKs at the appropriate times Ethernet Communication Communication with the Simulator and Controller will be handled through TCP/IP sockets over the Ethernet connection. The Simulator will act as a  server  and listen on ports 200 and 201. The controller will be the  client  and initiate any connections. Since the controller will not necessarily know the IP address of all the connected simulators   the controller will send out a broadcast command asking for their IPs. The simulators will then respond with their IP address then the controller will be able to initialize a TCP connection on port 201. The controller and simulator will be required to send and receive on port 201 without blocking each other. Thus while the controller is sending a USB request, the simulator can be receiving that request and sending a response from the previous request. If the simulator does not get a response from the controller quickly enough what happens, then it should respond with a NAK.

Spec reviews The spec is owned by Hiroo Umeno. It is located in   HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\Specs\\cert"  \\xbox\Specs\cert It is currently a work in progress and is being finalized at this time, although it will be frequently revised as we make progress with online features, etc. Tools needed Perf   none, or maybe framerate measuring with XBPerfmon. XDK Launcher Functions to set the machine up as required for certification test scenarios will be built into the XDK Launcher, and will be accessible via menu selection. These will be enumerated in the test case section. Kernel Debugger The standard kernel debugger (i386kd.exe) will be used with the DevKits that will be used for certification testing.  Debugger Macros Debugger macros to check things like arguments passed to NtCreateFile(), etc, need to be written to support some certification requirements. These will be enumerated in the test case section. Debugger Output Scanner The logs created by the debugger can be manually read, or we can write a tool to scan them. This will be easy and is low-priority. Debugger extensions to dump certain data structures in the kernel we may want to look at We need to evaluate if there are any kernel data structures we want to make sure never get changed by a game, and then use an extension or a debugger command macro to check these during/after a game test run. Netmon, possibly modified to look at our packets. Tool to dump XTL version information from submitted XBE files. Imaging tool to get the tape image onto the DVD Simulators This is being handled by Adam Green. Certification Kernel So far, the only thing we may do is remap some PCI data to move the addresses of devices we are concerned about (right now, only the IDE controller) so that direct access to this device will cause a failure we can detect and fail a tile for. Tactics Database For each game submitted for certification, a record of all test variations attempted will be kept, and a summary report from these tests, along with a PASS or FAIL status, will be generated and passed to the next team in the release process. Deliverables Launcher List of Certification test cases derived from Tactics database so game developers can pre-test their games before submission. Hardware needed 31 XDK kits 29 Development Host PCs w/DVD EMU 14 13  Color TVs 11 20  Color TVs w/S-Video and Composite in 11 17  monitors 18 Debug Xbox consoles 18 Retail consoles 6 AV switches w/S-Video and Composite 1 Studio grade monitor 2 HDTV (480p, 720p, 1080i and 16:9 widescreen support) 1 Dedicated PC Win2K Server 2 Dolby Digital/DTS receiver 48 Xbox standard controllers (does not include those in the XDKs) 58 Xbox Memory Units (does not include those in the XDKs) 2set Dolby 5.1 Speakers 15 Pairs Headphones 15 RCA to Headphones converters 2 USB simulators Network Hubs Further on down the road: If we want to do this in Japan and England, we need to duplicate this setup in those locations. The Online Test Team will need to provide server access so games can be run against backends to satisfy Online Certification Requirements. Test methods Test code What needs to be written? Some simple debugger macros to check data passed to certain APIs. This is trivial. A tool to parse debugger logs if reading them manually is too time consuming. What can be borrowed / adapted? The XDK Launcher will be modified to have functions for setting the box up for some of the Certification test scenarios. XBPerfmon can be used to look at various performance characteristics and to track memory utilization. We can use Tactics to store test scenarios and results. We can use Raid to track bugs. We can generate reports that summarize and list all problems found by querying Raid and Tactics. What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? Jim Helm will provide the changes to the XDK Launcher to support the required Certification test scenarios. Someone will have to write the parser for the debugger log files. Someone will have to write the tool for generating the Certification test report from data in Raid and Tactics. How do you generate test data? XDK Launcher. Tests 1.0-1-1 ROM Access There is no good way to do this. Ideas are: If we knew where our code was in the image, we could make sure that all calls into the kernel came from that region (but we don t know this where our code is..). There are various other schemes, all of which are hard, expensive, and require a lot of work No test case for this for now. 1.0-1-2 System Management Controller Access The way we test for this is with a Certification Kernel that turns off port access when we are not making changes. The shipped DevKits have all the ports left on. Any game that does not turn them back on before attempting to change them will fault. This information should be considered internal only. 1.0-1-3 Ethernet Controller Hardware Access  For games that are not authorized to do network access, we connect a sniffer (Netmon) and see if this machine emits any packets. For games that are authorized to use networking code, we look at packets to make sure they are correctly signed. As far as detecting code which touches the network hardware directly, There are 3 ways to do this, none of which are practical during the early phase of this project. It is to disassemble all the game code, and look for   and   instructions that target the NIC specific registers. Put data BPs on all addresses used to access this device. Have a debugger extension log the state of this device at various times so we can see what it is, and then break in a few times and look to see if it has changed. 1.0-1-4 USB Access Level Using the USB Simulator, we can simulate devices that anyone writing their own USB stack has never seen, and we can catch people not using the libraries. We can also use boxes without the daughter card and short-cabled controllers, which removes the internal hub from the equation, and see that the game responds correctly. External developers will not have seen a system like this, it may expose any hacks they may have made. This information should be considered internal only. 1.0-1-5 TV Encoder Hardware Access The way we test for this is with a Certification Kernel that turns off port access when we are not making changes. The shipped DevKits have all the ports left on. Any game that does not turn them back on before attempting to change them will fault. This information should be considered internal only. 1.0-1-6 XTL Version ll need a tool to do this, should be simple, scan all the XBE files in a tile, and dump out their XTL version numbers.  Make sure those version numbers are approved release versions. 1.0-1-6-a XTL Libraries Assuming we can get the version, we can check the reported game version with the list of approved versions of the XTL. 1.0-1-7 Startup Code Without symbols, verifying that this is the case will be difficult. No test case for this for now. 1.0-1-8 Memory/Clock Speed The way we test for this is with a Certification Kernel that turns off port access when we are not making changes. Port access is required to change these settings. The shipped DevKits have all the ports left on. Any game that does not turn them back on before attempting to change them will fault. This information should be considered internal only. 1.0-1-9  Faster Storage Performance When available, we ll obtain faster Hard Disk Drives and faster DVD drives and install them and run the game. No difference should be noted. This may be initially difficult since there may be software changes required to get the new hardware to work (we can t really get off the shelf replacement faster DVD drives due to the special firmware we use). We should not have too many problems getting a faster hard drive to work. 1.0-1-10 Memory Unit Maximum Capacity When available, we will insert one of these units into a controller, and then save / load a game from it. These units are not currently available. 1.0-1-11 Hard Disk System File Reliance After using the Cert_1.0-1-11 (removes all system files, soundtracks, etc) menu option from the XDK Launcher, the game will be played and should not have any problems. Global Settings Access  Test will use Cert Tool 1.0-1-12 and record the four provided checksums and all settings for the areas of the EPROM.  The game will be played and after it is shut down, test will run the Cert Tool again and verify no settings have changed and all checksums are valid. 1.0-1-13 Display Time Tester looks at time displayed on Game and verifies that the correct time is displayed. Tester adjusts time zone on console using XDK Launcher, boots game, and makes sure correct time is displayed. 1.0-1-14 Device Types 1.) Play game with standard controller, it should be recognized and work correctly 2.) Use the USB Simulator to simulate some illegal device types, they should be ignored by the game. 1.0-1-15 Widescreen Display Games will be played on a normal aspect-ratio (4:3) television with the widescreen mode disabled. The tester will verify that the game does not attempt to use widescreen mode. 1.0-1-16 NTSC Signal Output Games will be played on Xbox units set for North America or Japan with each type of AV pack installed. Testers will use an NTSC television to verify that the output signal is correct. 1.0-1-17 HDTV Signal Output Games will be played on Xbox units set for North America or Japan with an HDTV AV Pack installed. Testers will use an HDTV-enabled television to verify that the output signal is correct. The 720p and 1080i HDTV modes will not be enabled for this test. 1.0-1-18  PAL Display Games will be played on Xbox units set for Europe with each type of AV pack installed.  A PAL television will be used to verify that the output signal is correct. The PAL-60 option will not be enabled for this test. 1.0-1-19  PAL-60 Support Games will be played on a system set for the Europe region with each AV pack except the HDTV AV Pack installed. After enabling the PAL-60 option in the Dashboard, the tester will connect the Xbox to a television that supports PAL-60 and verify that it displays properly. 1.0-1-20 High-Resolution HDTV Modes If the game claims to support 720p, it will be played with an HDTV AV Pack installed driving a television that supports 720p. The tester will enable the 720p option in the Dashboard and verify proper display. If the game claims to support 1080i, it will be played with an HDTV AV Pack installed driving a television that supports 1080i.  The tester will enable the1080i option in the Dashboard and verify that it displays properly. 1.0-1-21  Dual Audio Outputs The game will be played using an AV pack that supports both outputs. The output will be connected first to an analog device, then to an optical device. 1.0-1-22 System Link Configuration For games that are allowed to support System Link, the feature will be tested with a direct system link, a 100mbps hub, and a 100mbps hub. The game should function normally in all cases. Connect 2 consoles with the system link cable Launch game on both consoles Check to see that it plays as expected Connect 2 consoles with the standard network cables and a hub Launch game on both consoles Check to see that it plays as expected 1.0-1-23 Network Bandwidth During certification, testers will watch network utilization across both 10Mbps and 100Mbps hubs. There must be no noticeable game play differences on game play between 10Mbps and 100Mbps networks. 1.0-1-24 Interference to Existing Network To test whether games generate unacceptably high levels of network traffic / interfere with LANs they are connected to, the game will be tested on a LAN with several PCs attached which will be performing network operations. None of these operations should be interfered with to the point where the LAN is unusable. 1.0-2-1 Slower Storage Performance After running a tile, and letting it use the Game Data (tdata) and User Data (udata) regions of the Hard Disk and MUs, the files will be fragmented using the Cert_1.0-2-1 (fragments tdata \ udata) menu option from the XDK Launcher, and the game will be played. Performance should not degrade below acceptable limits when accessing the fragmented storage. 1.0-2-2  Global Soundtrack Dependencies After using the Cert_1.0-2-2 (removes all soundtracks) menu option from the XDK Launcher, the game will be played and should not have any problems. 1.0-2-3 Memory Unit Access Speed Currently this area is under review for a test case. 1.0-2-4 Saved Game Roaming The tester plays the game, saves a game to the Hard Disk, and then the game is moved to a MU using the Dashboard. On a second XBox, the game is installed, and then the game is loaded from the MU. There must be no problem with using this game related to data stored on the Hard Disk. 1.0-2-5 Saved Game Name The tester navigates to the game-saving feature of the game during various times during the game, and saves the game. The saved games are then viewed through the Dashboard to make sure the names are user-friendly and easy to use. 1.0-2-6 Saved Game Default Name The tester plays the game, and saves periodically. There should be a default name for the game played. 1.0-2-7 Saved Game Directory Entry Limit The tester fills the udata section with 4096 entries using Cert_1.0-2-7 (fills udata\<gameid>with 4096 entries) option from the XDK Launcher, then loads the game and attempts to save a game. The game must fail to save a game gracefully, and also have no other failures related to this. 1.0-2-8 Memory Unit Persistence The tester loads a game from the memory unit, then replaces the memory unit with a different one and plays the game. The game should function correctly. 1.0-2-9 Dynamic Update of Memory Units The tester will navigate to the game saving area of the game, and will remove and insert various memory units. After each change, the game UI must update within 1 second to reflect the changes in attached devices. 1.0-2-10 Utility Region Persistence The TCR states:  During certification, the hard disk will be examined during the initial boot to ensure that data is being loaded first from the DVD into RAM, and being streamed to the utility region only after being in RAM This isn t going to happen; there isn t really a good way to check this. What will happen is that we ll purge the game s cache partition periodically, and resume play, something like: load game, play, save a game using Cert_1.0-2-10 (clears utility drive\gameID) option from the XDK Launcher, clear the cache partition the game has been using. boot game, load game saved in step 1, everything should work fine. 1.0-2-11 Static Content There is no way for Test to verify that the data files created outside of the Game s Utility Region are to improve I/O performance.  Test will verify that the game does not depend on data files not in the game s Utility Region, but that is covered elsewhere. There is no test case for this now. 1.0-2-12 Audio Fidelity Tester listens to audio during gameplay to determine whether there are audio problems. 1.0-2-13 Game Identification Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will launch the game to the main menu, turn off the Xbox console and then boot into the Xbox Dashboard. The tester will ensure that the game information is displayed correctly in the Dashboard. 1.0-2-14 Game Representative Image Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will load the game to the main menu, turn off the box, and then boot to the Dashboard. The tester will ensure that the appropriate image is displayed in the Games Area. 1.0-3-14-a Saved Game Representative Image Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will save a game. The tester will ensure that the appropriate image is displayed in the memory area of the Xbox Dashboard.  The game may, at its option, choose to create unique descriptive images for each saved game or use a common image for all of its saved games.  Saved game images must be distinct from the game representative image. 1.0-2-15 Game Stability The game should not ever crash during Cert (and probably not during Functional and Play testing as well) 1.0-2-16 Robustness Against Lost Link  Tester will go to all places in the game related to network access / connectivity and connect / disconnect the network link on the box, and these areas should be stable. They will also start a networked play session, and disconnect, and the game should be stable. 1.0-2-17 Out of Frame Video Copied from cert doc: During certification, testers will play the game on a TV that reveals the overscan area. Displaying debug information, system status, or performance data in the overscan area is not acceptable. 1.0-2-18 Game Safe Area (Non-HDTV) The tester will play the game on a television that has a clearly marked  safe area  on the screen (the marking will be made either through electronic means, or even through marking the screen with tape or a marker) and make sure that no critical display information appears outside this area. The TCR defines the safe are as the 85% inner area of the screen.  Using Cert_1.0-2-18 (draws outline of non-HDTV safe area) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester will mark the safe area on the TV used for testing. The tester plays the game and looks for critical text and menu items falling outside of this are during testing. 1.0-2-19 Game Safe Area (HDTV) The tester will play the game on a television that has a clearly marked  safe area  on the screen (the marking will be made either through electronic means, or even through marking the screen with tape or a marker) and make sure that no critical display information appears outside this area. The TCR defines the safe are as the 95% inner area of the screen (inner 608   456 pixels) using Cert_1.0-2-19 (draws outline of HDTV safe area) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester will mark the safe area on the TV used for testing. The tester plays the game and looks for critical text and menu items falling outside of this are during testing. 1.0-2-20  Error Handling Testers will note any error notifications during gameplay and note those that appear to be irrelevant. 1.0-2-21 Error Messages Testers will examine each error message encountered during game play, and note those that appear to have incorrect information or inappropriate text. 1.0-2-22 Unusable MUs Testers will verify that unformatted, corrupt or damaged MUs are not listed by Xbox games as a viable saving location. *Games can inform the User that an MU is unformatted and prompt them to go to the Dashboard to format it. 1.0-2-23 Message While Loading Testers will verify that no Xbox games use terms like  Setup Install  while loading content from the game disc or directly to/from the Hard Disk.  All User messages will be verified. 1.0-2-24 Game Loading Time Limit Tester will verify that no Xbox game sits in a state of inactivity for more than 15 seconds while loading data to the Utility Region.  Tester will verify this TCR through timing the  loading  sections of the game. 1.0-3-1 Hard Disk Saved Game Support Tester will attempt to save game to Hard Disk, this should work flawlessly. 1.0-3-2 Hard Disk Saved Game Free Space Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will play the game on an Xbox video game system that has no free space. When warned, the tester will free only the minimum space required. Later, the tester will attempt to save the game state.    Using Cert_1.0-3-2 (fills udata area, but with less than 4096 entries) option from the XDK Launcher, tester will fill the udata area. 1.0-3-3 Hard Disk Game Free Space Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will play the game on an Xbox video game system that has no free space. When warned, the tester will free only the minimum required space.   Using Cert_1.0-3-3 (fills tdata area) option from the XDK Launcher, tester will fill the tdata area. 1.0-3-4 Cleanup Support Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will play the game on an Xbox video game system that has no free space. When warned, the tester must be allowed to boot into the Xbox Dashboard to free space. Using Cert_1.0-3-4 (fills tdata and udata area) option from the XDK Launcher, tester will fill the drive. The game will then be started and must allow the user to clean up either by booting the Dashboard or through internal cleanup mechanisms that do not cause problems with the user s data or other game data (they should only be cleaning their own regions). 1.0-3-5 Memory Unit Capacity The tester will attempt to save a game to a clean MU. It should fit on the MU with no problems. 1.0-3-6 Memory Unit Roaming Copied from cert doc: During certification, the tester will play the game on an Xbox video game system and save at various points on a memory unit (either in-game or through Xbox Dashboard transfer). The tester will then take the memory unit to a second Xbox console on which the game has never been saved and attempt to launch and play the saved game. 1.0-3-7 Saved Game Management Using the game, the tester saves a game Using Cert_1.0-3-7 (check saved game signature) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester opens a saved game and notes whether the launcher detects that the game is signed. Note that there is some work still required at this time to support doing this. 1.0-3-8 Memory Unit Warning During all times a memory unit is being written to, there must be a correct warning displayed. To test: Identify all places in the game where a game can be saved to an MU In these places, save a game. Make sure the warning is properly displayed during the save. 1.0-3-9 Hard Disk Warning During all times the hard drive is being written to (except for the utility drive, which gets formatted), there must be a correct warning displayed. To test: Identify all places in the game where a game writes to tdata or udata (this may be problematic   maybe we can expose a light from the drive so we can more easily detect activity) Make sure the warning is properly displayed (see TCR for definition of  properly ) during disk activity. 1.0-3-10 Memory Unit Personalization Using the Dashboard or XDK Launcher, personalize MUs. At least one with the maximum number of characters you can use, and one with the minimum you can use. Launch the game. Navigate to areas that display MUs and make sure the name is correctly displayed.  1.0-3-11 Space Display The tester launches the game, and observes the amount of space listed for each attached memory device displayed by the game The game is ejected and the XDK Launcher is started Using Cert_1.0-3-11 (lists available blocks for all attached memory devices) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester notes the amount of space listed as available. The tester compares the amounts listed by the game and those listed by the XDK launcher and makes sure these numbers agree. 1.0-3-12 Maximum Number of Blocks Using the Dashboard, the tester makes sure that the tdata region or udata region has 50,000 free blocks. Saved games and game data are deleted to make more room if there is not this much already available. The tester launches the game and examines those areas where free space is displayed. When the game is looking at a region with more than 50,000 free blocks the tester makes sure that this information is correctly displayed. 1.0-3-13 Memory Unit Location Using a controller and a MU, the tester will save a game using each controller position, and each MU position to make sure that a game can be saved. 1.0-3-14 Global Language Setting Using Cert_1.0-3-14 (change language setting) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester will cycle though each setting, then launch the game to make sure it took the appropriate action as defined in the TCR. 1.0-3-15 Global Time Zone Setting Using Cert_1.0-3-15 (change time zone setting) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester will cycle though each setting, then launch the game to make sure it took the appropriate action as defined in the TCR. 1.0-3-16 Menu Buttons During gameplay, the tester will make sure the buttons conform to the standards in the TCR, namely: The A button must select the current option or confirm an action The B button and the BACK button cancel an action The START button may be mapped to the same functionality as the A button, or it may perform a more appropriate action The tester will use the buttons to navigate through the game s interface, and make sure the buttons are correctly utilized. Please see the TCR for more details, I copied the salient info here, but there is more to this.  1.0-3-17 Menu Navigation The tester will make sure the directional pad can navigate through all out-of-game menus. 1.0-3-18 In-Game Pause If the game supports in-game pausing, this functionality shall be accessed through the START button. The tester will use the START button to enter a paused state, and then resume the game. Also, the tester should try activating the START button several times in rapid succession to pause/restart the game quickly several times and make sure that it behaves correctly and does not crash or have any other error. 1.0-3-19 Vibration Function Outside Gameplay During testing, the tester will note if they notice any vibration outside of gameplay aside from what is allowed in the TCR. 1.0-3-20 Controller Selection The tester will ensure that the game can be started from any controller plugged into any controller port on the console. Using 1 controller, start the game, exit the game, move the controller to the next slot and repeat until all slots have been used. Using 4 controllers plugged into the console, start the game from each one. Using different 1st and 3rd party controllers, make sure you can start the game. 1.0-3-21 Controller Discovery Note all areas in the game UI where controller information is exposed. In each of these areas, perform the following tasks: Using 1 controller, plug it into each of the 4 ports and make sure the game updates it s display within 1 second If the game displays MUs, while plugged into each port, plug 1 MU into the controller and make sure the game updates it s display within 1 second If the game displays MUs, when plugged into each port, plug 2 MUs into the controller and make sure the game updates it s display within 1 second If the game displays MUs, when plugged into each port, unplug all MUs from controller and make sure the game updates it s display within 1 second. 1.0-3-22 Loss of Controller The game should, if pausing is supported, enter the paused state when a controller is removed during gameplay.  If the pause feature is supported, during gameplay, remove an in-use controller. The game should pause. Reconnect the controller, the game should remain paused Press the START button, gameplay should resume Try this in each controller position. 1.0-3-23 Button Availability Games must not map game actions to non-existent controls. To test this we should use a Duke controller, since it has the fewest allowed buttons of any input device. We will not be building versions of controllers with missing buttons. 1.0-3-24 Selection User Interface The tester will examine the selection method a game uses in it s menu system and make sure that when something is selected, it is very obvious   the must not be states where selection is ambiguous. 1.0-3-25 Xbox Official Naming Standards All text in the game that refers to XBox, controllers, the console, etc, must conform to the XBox Terminology guide, please see the guide for these standards. The tester will look at all text and note any that does not conform to this standard. 1.0-3-26 Unsupported Characters Games must display characters they icknames, MU and soundtrack names with localized text) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester programs a MU with the desired text for these items. The tester, after determining where in the game this information is displayed, inserts the MU and notes the display   it should either correctly display the text, or display the  guage, please see the guide for these standards. The tester will look at all text and note any that does not conform to this standard. 1.0-3-28 Terminology Consistency During testing, the tester will read all text (that covered by the Terminology Guide and all other text) and try to notice any that is inconsistent or confusing. 1.0-3-29 In-Game Non-Interactive Cinematic Sequences The tester will identify all those non-interactive cinematic sequences in the game The tester will then attempt to interrupt each one using the A button. If it is the first time the sequence is played, it may continue. If it is not the first time, the sequence must be skipped when the A button is pressed. 1.0-3-30 Initial Interactive State The tester will ensure that the game become interactive within 20 seconds of the end of the XBox boot animation sequence. Tester inserts game XBox Boot animation sequence starts When that sequence is finished, tester starts timing Within 20 seconds, the game should be in a start where it accepts user input of some kind, as the TCR states  The screen must contain text that prompts players to press the Start button to begin interacting with the game 1.0-3-31 Non-Interactive Pause Any time the game pauses for more than 5 seconds, there must be some visual indication that the game is paused. The tester will note all places in the game where pauses greater than 5 seconds occur. The game must show something that indicates the paused state. It must be something other than static text, the game must do something visually that shows activity. 1.0-3-32 Soundtrack Access Since the Soundtrack APIs are in the XTL, which are bound to the game, which we won t have symbols for, there is nothing we can do in the kernel to ensure that these APIs are being used to access the soundtrack.  No test case for this for now. 1.0-3-33 Copying Soundtrack Songs We can detect reading soundtracks (along with all other file reads as discussed in 1.0-2-11). We may notice if a game is trying to do this, or we may not notice it, it is easy to hide. What we can do is make a list of the files on the hard drive and all attached MUs before the game is played, and make a list after, and compare them to see if it appears that any soundtrack data was copied. Use Cert_1.0-3-33 (makes list of all files on console, both hard disk and MUs) option from the XDK Launcher before we test a game. After we have played a game, we make another list using Cert_1.0-3-33 option from the XDK Launcher We compare the lists, and look for any files that are the same length as soundtrack items 1.0-3-34 Transporting Soundtrack Songs Again, we can t really use the kernel for this requirement as proposed by the TCR, but we can look at before and after changes in the filesystem. Use Cert_1.0-3-33 (makes list of all files on console, both hard disk and MUs) option from the XDK Launcher before we test a game. After we have played a game, we make another list using Cert_1.0-3-33 option from the XDK Launcher We compare the lists, and look for any files that are the same length as soundtrack items We do the same thing for any machines that were connected to the XBox LAN and used for LAN play   we want to check that the games did not share music between the consoles on the LAN. 1.0-3-35 Global Settings Update Using Cert_1.0-3-34 (list all global settings) option from the XDK Launcher, generate list of all settings before playing the game. Play the game, and if there are options to change the settings, use them After changing the settings in the game, exit the game and use Cert_1.0-3-34 option from the XDK Launcher and compare it with the first list that was made. Nothing should have changed. 1.0-3-36 System Clock Change your watch to the displayed time when starting the game As you play the game, when the time is displayed, make sure it matched your watch If the game has overridden the display with their own bias, make sure to take that into account Exit the game, launch the XDK Launcher and make sure the time matches what is displayed on your watch. 1.0-3-37 Attract Mode Insert the game into the console, and wait for the attract mode to start  When attract mode has started, watch it and make sure it does not repeat itself for at least 60 seconds 1.0-3-38 Attract Mode Cycle Insert the game into the console, and wait for the attract mode to start  When attract mode has started, watch it and make sure it switches between the attract mode and an interactive screen. Verify that the game never stays at the initial Start screen for more than 75 seconds. 1.0-3-39 Attract Mode Stability We require that a game run in attract mode for 1 week. This means that we need to tie up a console for a week to make sure that this is the case, or we can cheat and do the following with a pretty good chance that we can predict that it will actually stay up for a week. Insert the game into the console, and wait for the attract mode to start  Start XBPerfmon Turn logging on in XBPerfmon, and pay particular attention to memory usage and handle counts Track the memory usage and handle counts over a 24 hour period Using the data generated over 24 hours, extrapolate it to 7 days and see if any leak noticed will run the machine out of memory over that time period If in doubt, keep running in attract mode. ll need more test consoles to support this 1.0-3-40 Attract Mode Interrupt On a console with at least 1 controller and 1 MU, insert a game and let it start and enter attract mode Unplug the controller, nothing should happen Plug the controller back in, attract mode should quit within 1 second and the user should be at a menu Let the game enter attract mode again Remove a MU, nothing should happen Plug the MU back in, attract mode should quit within 1 second and the user should be at a menu Let the game enter attract mode again Press a button on the controller, attract mode should quit within 1 second and the user should be at a menu 1.0-3-41 Start-up Without Controller Disconnect all controllers from console Insert the game into the console, and wait for the attract mode to start  It should start as expected and enter attract mode as expected. 1.0-3-42 Networking Configuration During gameplay, the tester will note if they were prompted for this type of information. If they were, the game fails. 1.0-3-43 System Link Play Interoperability To talk to anything other than another XBox, the game would have to implement its own net stack, the one we provide will not talk to anything but other XBox consoles and XBox servers. Probably the easiest thing to do would be to have a sniffer on an all-console network, and see if we can detect any traffic that is not our packets. The network guys will need to help with this one. 1.0-3-44 System Link Play Menu Option If a game has System Link functionality: Connect the console to a network (with or without other consoles? Does it matter?) Navigate to the menu in the game that controls System Link functionality It should be enabled Unplug the network cable The menu should be disabled within 1 second Plug the network cable back in The menu should be enabled within 1 second Repeat this procedure in all parts of the game where system Link functionality is exposed 1.0-3-45 Restart for Networking The game should not have to restart to enable System Link play on a console that was started without a connection to the network, or on a console that was connected, disconnected, and reconnected. Launch System Link enabled game with console disconnected from the network After the game has launched, reconnect the box to the network Play the game, the System Link functionality should work Go into the game s menu Disconnect the network cable Reconnect the network cable Play the game, the System Link functionality should work 1.0-3-46 Maximum Number of Connected Xboxes The limit is 17 Our internal XBox lab network will need to support 17+ units for this test Connect 16 consoles to the network, launch the game on all of the consoles, make sure it works correctly in this mode Add a 17th console to the network Make sure that the 17th console cannot join the game Make sure the other 16 consoles are still functioning correctly 1.0-3-47  Use of Dolby Digital If the game is Dolby Digital enabled, plug it into a Dolby Digital receiver The sound should function correctly 1.0-3-48  Interactive Dolby Digital Feature If the game supports Interactive Dolby Digital, plug it into a Dolby Digital Reciever Play through in-game scenarios, sound output at least once in-game must by Dolby Digital There is no way to verify if our APIs are being used.  This has been omitted from the Test Cases for now. 1.0-3-49  Dolby Digital Transmission Test will verify this TCR by: Connecting game to Dolby Digital Receiver via Optical cable and verifying Dolby Digital is output. Using Netmon, the Ethernet port will be sniffed for packets.  Test will ensure that no Dolby Digital data is being transmitted.  While it is true, we cannot tell if the packets contain pre-rendered Dolby Digital or Interactive, it allows us to flag it and question the ISV as to why any Dolby data is being sent out via the network. 1.0-3-50  Dolby Digital Pre-Encoded Data To verify Test will enable Dolby Digital (on a game that supports Dolby digital)in the dash and play the game through a Dolby Digital receiver.  Test will re-run the above test but disable the Dolby Digital in the dash. If Dolby Digital is disabled in the dash, no Dolby transmissions must occur. 1.0-3-51  DTS Pre-Encoded Data To verify Test will enable DTS (on a game that supports DTS)in the dash and play the game through a DTS receiver.  Test will re-run the above test but disable the DTS in the dash. If DTS is disabled in the dash, no DTS transmissions must occur. 1.0-3-52 Game Soundtrack Volume Control If game supports player-created soundtracks, tester will verify that volume control for player-created soundtracks exists, and verify that it actually works. If soundtracks are supported, locate volume control Make sure it works 1.0-3-53 Player Confirmation of Destructive Actions In general, the tester will need to make sure that the game does not allow the user to do things with negative consequences (lose data) without first warning the user that this will happen. The tester will need to follow a procedure similar to the following to test this. Determine what areas change data, for instance, loading a saved game while in the middle of a level will lose the state for that level. In these areas, make sure the user gets notified that their action will have a possibly negative consequence, and prompt for a response. The TCR has some guidelines as to what constitutes good ways to prompt and bad ways to prompt (for instance, pressing A blindly and repeatedly should not wipe out your data) 1.0-3-54 Controller Representation If game uses graphical representations of the Xbox controller, Test will verify: Graphic used is for correct default region Graphic matches rules set forth in the Xbox Terms Guide 1.0-3-55 Controller Button Representation Games may represent controller buttons to the users either graphically or in text form.  Test will verify: Graphics used match rules set forth in the Xbox Terms Guide Games that use their own artistic version of button graphics must use the button label text set forth in the Xbox Terms Guide. 1.0-3-56  Vibration Option Test will verify that if an Xbox game supports vibration features that there is a way for the User to disable the features. 1.0-3-57 Default Choices Presented For System Link Play For Xbox games that use system link play, there must be intelligent defaults for all options.  Test will verify: That a User can join a Link Play game w/o having to change any options (default options are selected) If a User does not want to change any options, they should be able to navigate through System Link Menu, just by pressing A button 1.0-3-58 Naming of Multiple Game Sessions for System Link Play For Xbox games that use system link play, there must be a descriptive default name a game session.  Test will verify: That a User can Host a new game session w/o having to come up with a name for the session (default  descriptive  name created) User must be given the option of changing the default session name. Default or edited session names must be displayed by the game UIs list of available sessions to join. 1.0-3-59 Session Discovery Time for System Link Play For a game that supports System Link play, Tester will verify that the game discovers all available sessions in 3 seconds or under. 1.0-3-60 Game Sound Volume For Xbox games that use both in-game music and sound effects, Test will verify that the user is given the option to adjust the volume of each individually. 1.0-3-61 Multi-Disc Game For multiple disc Xbox games, test will verify that the user is never prompted in game to insert the next disc. 1.0-3-62 Soft Reset For Xbox games that support Soft-Reset, Test will verify that holding down the START and BACK buttons for 3 seconds or more, resets the Xbox.  This will be checked at various locations in the game. 1.0-4-1 IDE Hardware Access In the Certification Kernel, we ll remap PCI data to move the addresses of devices we are concerned about (right now, only the IDE controller) so that direct access to this device will cause a failure we can detect and fail a tile for. When this change is made, it will be documented so that this condition can be recognized by the tester. 1.0-4-2 Hard Disk and Memory Unit Access Layer This isn t feasible, aside from checking that all filesystem accesses are to legal (in the appropriate data areas), we ll not check this. 1.0-4-3 Hard Disk and Memory Unit Region Access This one is pretty simple, we use a debugger macro that looks like this: kd> bp xboxkrnl!NtCreateFile "dt OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES poi(esp+0xc);g" kd> g    +0x000 RootDirectory    : 0xfffffffd    +0x004 ObjectName       : 0xd003bed8 "c:\devkit\SAMPLES\ShadowBuffer\SHADOWBUFFER.XBE"    +0x008 Attributes       : 0x40    +0x000 RootDirectory    : 0xfffffffd    +0x004 ObjectName       : 0xd003bed8 "c:\devkit\SAMPLES\XDASH\XBOXDASH.XBE"    +0x008 Attributes       : 0x40    +0x000 RootDirectory    : 0xfffffffd    +0x004 ObjectName       : 0xd003c5c0 "c:\devkit\STRESS.XBE"    +0x008 Attributes       : 0x40 It dumps the OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES passed to NtCreateFile(), which gives us the file accessed. This is put in a debugger log created by .logopen on the host debugger at the beginning of  gameplay. You must also note that this debug output has a performance impact, and not run debugger commands like this when measuring performance We can do similar things with other APIs where this is deemed necessary, and have them all dumped to a debugger log. 1.0-4-4 Nickname Access Since the Nickname APIs are in the XTL, which are bound to the game, which we won t have symbols for, there is nothing we can do in the kernel to ensure that these APIs are being used to access the nicknames.  No test case for this for now. 1.0-4-5 Xbox Dashboard Stability The tester notes each section of the game where there is user data (saved games) written to the hard disk or a MU. From these areas, the tester saves data The tester exits the tile and browses this are with the Dashboard, for instance, with saved games, the tester uses the saved game management are of the Dashboard to browse this data. Browsing this data should cause mo problems with the Dashboard 1.0-4-6 Ethernet Port Access copied from Cert doc: During certification, each XBE will be scanned for code that connects to the Ethernet port and run on a special, instrumented Xbox that will flag port activity. 1.0-4-7 Sharing Storage over the Network Examine the game and look for functionality that does things like copying files from one console for another. This type of thing is forbidden. Things like sharing game state are acceptable. 1.0-4-8  Saved Game Content Protection Using Cert_1.0-3-7 (check saved game signature) option from the XDK Launcher, the tester opens a saved game and notes whether the launcher detects that the game is signed. Note that there is some work still required at this time to support doing this. This is pretty much the same as 1.0-3-7 1.0-5-1 Memory Unit If a game is trying to acquire the Memory Unit icon, test will verify: Game supports roaming saved games Memory Unit is available in-game as a valid save location Amount of free blocks on MU is presented in the Save UI. 1.0-5-2 Non-Standard Peripheral If an Xbox game is trying to acquire a non-standard peripheral icon, test will verify: All game menus can be navigated using the standard Xbox default controller Unless the game is going for a  Bundle with  option for the controller, the game s basic functionality can be controlled via the standard Xbox default controller Game detects a supported non-standard peripheral and configures it correctly The non-standard peripheral can be used to control the game from any port. 1.0-5-3 Single Console Multiplayer Based upon the number of supported players reported on the game submission form, test will verify game can be player with one to maximum number of allowed players supported by the game. 1.0-5-4 Xbox System Link Any Xbox game that wants to display the System Link icon must meet all requirements for the System Link and Networking TCRs.  Testing will make note for this TCR, that all other System Link and Network tests pass and no TCRs are broken.  Successful pass on all other System Link and Network TCR tests is considered a pass for this TCR. 1.0-6-1 Surprise MU Removal Test will verify under all save and load MU scenarios, that if an MU is removed before the operation could finish, the following message is displayed: The memory unit <NAME> was removed during use.  <ACTION> failed. Test will also verify: <NAME> is replaced with: Name of memory card if it is personalized MU location if it is not personalized <ACTION> is  replaced with the current operation being performed Message must require user interaction to go away.  User must press A or START to confirm and dismiss message. 1.0-6-2 MU Write Warning Test will verify under all save scenarios, the following message is displayed: Saving memory unit <NAME> was removed during use.  Please do not remove memory units or disconnect any controllers. Test will also verify: <NAME> is replaced with: Name of memory card if it is personalized MU location if it is not personalized Message does not require user interaction to go away.  (must be displayed for 3 seconds or duration of write) 1.0-6-3 MU Read Warning Test will verify under all load MU scenarios, the following message is displayed: Loading <CONTENT>. Please don t remove memory units or disconnect any controllers. Test will also verify: <CONTENT> is replaced with: the data being loaded Message does not require user interaction to go away.  (must be displayed for 3 seconds or duration of read) 1.0-6-4 Hard Disk Write Warning Test will verify under all non-MU save scenarios, the following message is displayed: Saving <CONTENT>. Please don t turn off your Xbox. Test will also verify: <CONTENT> is replaced with: the data being written (saved) Message does not require user interaction to go away.  (must be displayed for 3 seconds or duration of read) 1.0-6-5 Content Protection Fault Test will verify under all load scenarios, the following message is displayed if content fails protection check: Unable to load <CONTENT>. Please A to continue. Test will also verify: <CONTENT> is replaced with: the data that was attempted Message must require user interaction to go away.  User must press A or START to confirm and dismiss message. 1.0-6-6 Press Start Test will verify on the initial interaction screen, the following message (or close approximation) is displayed:  Please press START to begin. Test will also verify: START button brings user to main game menu 1.0-6-7 Lost Controller Test will verify under all situations where a controller currently being used in a game is disconnected, the following message is displayed: Please reconnect the controller and press START to continue. Test will also verify: In games where pause is not supported,  and press START to continue  is omitted from the message In games that support pause, that after controller reconnection, that pressing START allows the player to resume game play. Message must require user interaction to go away.  User must press START to confirm and dismiss message (if pause is supported). 1.0-6-8 Low Storage Test will verify under all full Hard Disk scenarios, the following message is displayed: Your Xbox doesn t have <BLOCKS> free blocks to save games.  Press A to continue saving or B to start the Xbox Dashboard. Test will also verify: Message is displayed at game startup if not enough free space on Xbox Hard Disk <BLOCKS> is replaced with the number of blocks needed to create the saved game. Message must require user interaction to go away.  User must press A or B to confirm and dismiss message. 1.0-6-9 Bad Game Disc Test will verify under all potential bad scenarios, the following message is displayed: There s a problem with the disc you re using.  It may be dirty or damaged.  Press A to continue. Test will also verify: Message must require user interaction to go away.  User must press A to confirm and continue.  The game must offer some functionality if the user is asked to continue. Configuration tests The following Xbox configurations will be used for testing: XDK Xbox consoles Debug Xbox Consoles Retail Xbox consoles All hardware variants of both Debug and Retail Xbox consoles Performance testing Xbox games will not be measured for performance per say, during Compliance testing.  The following list are some ways in which performance will be checked and what tools will be used to do so: Game Inactivity State: Stopwatch Game load/save: Stop Watch, Xbox Certification Tools 72 Hour Stress run: Xbox PerfMon Initial Boot: Stopwatch Controller and Peripheral Enumeration: Stopwatch Localization impact The Redmond Compliance lab will be responsible for testing in the North American region.  This includes Mexico, United States and Canada.  Compliance test will be responsible for certifying games that are localized for Spanish and French languages.  Currently the localization issue is being discussed and this plan will be updated when more information is made available. Test complete criteria all tools written all test cases entered into Tactics database successful completion of August 2001 Pre-Certification pass. Release criteria When a game has completed all Certification requirements, it can continue through the release process. Exceptions to this will have to be approved by upper management in a case-by-case manner.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Recommended procedure:  TitleRecommended procedure:  Balash Akbari Normal Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU IGMPv2 Test Guide Notes: Refer to Appendix I for instruction in how to use the IGMP program to create, join, or send data to a multicast group. Make sure there are at least two functioning NIC are in the test machine. Configure each NIC to have multiple IP address. Field values (6 Cases) Start the NetMon program. Create a multicast group on the test machine Terminate the IGMP program. Stop the NetMon and observe the results. NetMon should at least show two packets: A Version 2 Membership Report generated from step #1 A Leave Group generated from step # 3 Check for the field values specified in the test plan. Case 6 Packet with Max Response Time set to 0 will interpreted as IGMPv1 query.  Therefore the test machine must response with IGMPv1 membership report for 400 second after receiving the query.  Before performing the next test wait for 400 seconds. Are all IGMP messages sent with TTL = 1? Scenario: Join and leave a multcast group. Sniff the IGMP packets.  Expected: TTL=1 in all of them.  Do all IGMP messages contain the Router Alert option? Scenario: Join and leave a multicast group. Sniff the IGMP packets.  Expected: The Router Alert option is included in all of them.  Are the type fields correct in the Report and Leave frames? Scenario: Join and leave a multcast group. Sniff the IGMP packets.  Expected: The Type field in the Report is 0x16. The Type field in the Leave is 0x17.  Is the Group Address field set correctly in the Report and Leave frames? Scenario: Join and leave a multicast group. Sniff the IGMP frames.  Expected: The Group Address field should contain the address of the multicast group entered into igmp.exe.  Do we transmit a Report immediately when we join a multicast group? Scenario: Join a multicast group. Look at the sniff. Expected: 3 Membership Reports.  Is the "Max Response Time" field interpreted correctly? Scenario: Join a multicast group. Send a Membership Query with the "Max Response Time" field set to:  30 - Expected Membership Report from the test host within 3 secs. 255 - Expected Membership Report from the test host within 26 secs. 0 - Expected Immediate IGMP Level 1 Membership Report from the test host. Bad Header (3 Cases) Start the NetMon program Use the BadHv2.tst Send header with type field 0x00 and 0xFF Send a packet with incorrect checksum Send a query when the group address is not a multicast group address Expect no response from the test machine. Are frames with invalid type information ignored? Scenario: Join a multicast group. Send frames to that group with the type field set to 0x0 and 0xFF. Expected: These frames should be ignored without bad side effects.  Is the checksum verified before processing the packet? Scenario: Send a Membership Query with an incorrect checksum.  Expected: the host should send No Report.  Do we discard the Query if the Group Address field is not a multicast group? Scenario: Join a few multicast groups. Send a Query to the host with the Group Address field set to a generic non-multicast IP address.  Expected: the host sends No Report. Query (5 Cases) Start the NetMon Use the GQueryV2.tst to general query. Use the MQueryv2.tst to generate group specific query. Confirm the responses are according to test plan. Do we report all memberships when responding to a General Query? Scenario: Join a few multicast groups on the host. Send a General Query to the host.  Expected: The host sends a response for each group before the Max Response Time specified inthe Query frame expires.  Do we report only the group which the Group Specific Query asked for? Scenario: Join a few multicast groups. Send a Group Specific Query targeting one of them.  Expected: The host should send a Report only for that one group.  Do we intercept Reports by other hosts, and supress reports? Scenario: Have two machines join the same multicast group. Send a Query with a long Max.Response Time. Expected: One of the hosts repsponds first. The second host shouldn't send a Report.  Are any reports sent for the 224.0.0.1 group? Scenario: Send a General Query. Expected: The host should not send a Response indicating his membership in the all-systems group.  Do we send Leave Group frames if this host Reported the last time? fall through - the next test covers this one too Leave Group (2 Cases) Start the NetMon Create a multicast group on two interfaces Use GQueryv2.tst to send a query Stop the NetMon Check the result for the correct behavior.  Do we really leave a group? Scenario: Join an multicast group. Send a General Query. Test host answers. Leave the group. Send a query again. Expected: The host should not answer any more.  Do we suppress reports if this host wasn't the last one sending a Report? Scenario: Have two machines join the same multicast group. Send a query. One of the hosts responds to the all-routers multicast group (224.0.0.2). Leave the multicast group on both of them. Expected: Only the host sending the Report earlier should send a Leave Group frame. IGMPv1 Compatibility (3 Cases) Start the NetMon Create Multicast groups using IGMP program. Use GQueryv2.tst to generate IGMPv2 query and Gqueryv1.tst to generate IGMPv2 query  Follow the test plan. Is the Max Response Time in the IGMPv1 Queries interpreted as 100? Scenario: Join a multicast group on the host. Send an IGMPv1 Query. Expected: The host should not reply immediately. The answer should have a random delay up to 10 sec.  Do we wait 400 secs after hearing an IGMPv1 Query before we send any IGMPv2 messages?  Send an IGMPv1 Query. Keep sending IGMPv2 Queries. Expected: The first IGMPv2 Report should be sent after 400 secs. Before that all Reports should be IGMPv1 reports.  Send an IGMPv1 Query. Keep joining and leaving a multicast group. Expected. Until the 400 secs expire the host should send IGMPv1 Membership Reports and should supress Leave frames.  Are our Reports suppressed by a version 1 Membership Report? Scenario: Join a multicast grop. Send an IGMPv1 Query with a long Max. Response Time. Send an IGMPv1 Report for the same multicast group. Expected: The test host should remain silent. Registry Entries (Cases 4) Change the value of IGMPLevel in the registry.  Reboot the machine and test the send and receive for each case. In NT the value must be added to the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters Value type: REG_DWORD In Memphis the value must be added to the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP Value Type: String 0 = No multicast support.  1 = Send IP multicast packets only.  2 = Send and receive IP multicast packets (participate in IGMP).  IGMPLevel = 0  try to send expected: fail  try to receive expected: fail  IGMPLevel = 1  try to send expected: success  try to receive expected: fail  IGMPLevel = 2  try to send expected: success  try to receive expected: success  IGMPLevel = 3 (invalid)  try to send expected: ?  try to receive expected: ?  Multi-homing and Receiving data (5 Cases) Create mulithome group. Use IGMP.exe to send data to that group. Follow the instruction in test plan. Scenario: Join a multicast group. Other host sends UDP packets to that address. Expected: Incoming data from the socket.  Do we send Reports on all interfaces in a multihomed machine? Scenario: Set up a host with two NICs one of them logically multihomed too. Join a multicast group on both NICs. Send a General Query on one side. Expected: Report sent only on that side  Try the other (logically multihomed) side. Expected: Only one Report is sent.  Scenario: Logically multihomed NIC. Multiple processes join a multicast group using separate specific IP addresses from the NIC. Expected: Incoming data show up in every process.  Crosstalk Scenario: Multiple processes join different multicast groups. (INADDR_ANY, SO_REUSEADDR - Paul_C_Drews@ccm.jf.intel.com ) Data sent to one of the groups. Expected: Only one of the processes (and the right one) should receive the data.  Scenario: Multiple processes join the same multicast group (different UDP port). Data sent to the group.(Van Jacobson; van@ee.lbl.gov) Expected: Only the process with the right UDP port will receive the data. Membership lists (2 Cases) Start the NetMon Use IGMP.exe to create multicast groups Use Gqueryv2.tst to generate IGMPv2 query Scenario: Multiple process join the same multicast group. Send a General Query. Expected: Only one Report. Scenario: Logically multihomed NIC. Multiple processes join a multicast group using separate specific IP addresses from the NIC. Expected: Only one Report. Only one Leave when the last process exits. IGMP is alive after reestablishment of WAN connection (Hammer into Anvil) As the date of this document this case has never been tested Scenario: Join a multicast group over a WAN link. Disconnect WAN link. Redial. Send Query. Expected: Host answer the Query.  setsokopt ip_multicast_if As the date of this document this case has never been tested Scenario: Physically(logically) multihomed box. Socket opened on one IP address. setsokopt IP_multicast_if tells us to use another of our addresses. Send data. Expected: It comes out only on the interface which has the IP address given in setsockopt().  Interoperability As the date of this document this case has never been tested Appendix I: IGMPv2 Test Guide Program igmp.exe is used to create, join, leave, or send data to a multicast group. Parameters: IGMP <s/r> <Local IP> <Multicast IP> <TTL> <Port> <Data size> <Iterations> join/create a multicast group send data to a multicast group Local IP  IP address of the local interface Multicast IP: IP address of the multicast group Time To Live value of IP packet (in IGMPv2 always 1) Port: port number that data is sent/received Data size Data size that is sent with s option  Iterations: Number of time data will be sent  Examples: Following command creates a process (A1) that establishes a multicast group with the multicast address of 233.0.1.1 on an interface with the IP address of 26.26.10.31 to receive data on port number 9000. IGMP r 26.26.10.31 233.0.1.1 9000 1 300 1 Since 233.01.1 is already created the following command creates a process (A2) that joins the 233.0.1.1 multicast group on an interface with the IP address of 26.26.10.33 to receive data on the port 9000.  IGMP r 26.26.10.33 233.0.1.1 9000 1 300 1 Following command creates a process (A3) that joins the 233.0.1.1 multicast group on an interface with the IP address of 26.26.10.35 to receive data on the port 9001.  IGMP r 26.26.10.35 233.0.1.1 9001 1 300 1 The following command multicast two 300 bytes set of data to the 233.0.1.1 multicast group from the 26.26.10.70 interface. IGMP s 26.26.10.70 233.0.1.1 9000 1 300 1 As the result members of the multicast group 233.0.1.1 that expects data on port 9000 (A1, A2) receives two sets of 300 bytes. To cause the IGMP process to leave a multicast group terminate the process. IGMPv2 Test Guide Balash Akbari  DATE \@ "MM/dd/yy"  03/05/97  PAGE

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. X-Box Test Harness TitleX-Box Test Harness johndaly Normal.dot Sakphong Chanbai Microsoft Word 9.0X-Box Test Harness The purpose of the test harness is to make it easy to run tests in several different ways. Due to the X-Box system being uniprocess, any time we need to run more than one test simultaneously we need to package the test into many static libraries and load/run the tests from a main program. And since most test executable will probably look about the same anyway, there is no sense in writing more than one in any case. several different ways  include running the tests individually, from now on known as APITestMode, and running them all together from now on known as StressTestMode. StressTestMode is equivalent to running the tests in APITestMode with the mode set to parallel and with some other stress specific settings. Please see the  INI file structure and functions  document for more details. How the test harness works It starts up Initializes logging and other things requiring initialization. It reads the general settings in the INI file to determine StressMode or APITestMode mode [APITestMode] mode Reads   from [APITestMode] to determine serial, parallel, or both Reads name of next test from the [TestList] Serial mode Reads  NumberOfThreads  from the [testmodule] section for the test found on [Test] Reads  LogLevel  and  LogFile  for the test  Reads  iterations  from the [test] section for the test found on TestList If more threads>1, spawns threads, otherwise just calls the StartTest() entry for that and passes the  LogLevel  and  LogFile  entries Iterates step   for  iterations  from the [test] section In the case of 1 thread, control is returned when the test finishes, runs test cleanup code (EndTest() from your test), then the next test is called from [TestList] In the case of multiple threads, the test harness waits until the threads are completed before running test cleanup code (EndTest() from your test) and then calling the next test from [TestList] Parallel mode Reads  NumberOfThreads  from the [test] section for the test found on [TestList] Reads  LogLevel  and  LogFile  for the test  Reads  iterations  from the [test] section for the test found on TestList Creates a controlling thread to run this test in, and this thread: If more threads>1, spawns threads, otherwise just calls the StartTest() entry for that test and passes the  LogLevel  and  LogFile  entries Iterates step   for  iterations  from the [test] section In the case of 1 thread, control is returned to controlling thread when the test finishes, then the cleanup code is called (EndTest() from your test) In the case of multiple threads, the controlling thread waits until the threads are completed before running test cleanup code (EndTest() from your test) and exiting  Then the next test is called from [TestList] When all the tests from [TestList] have been started up, waits for them to finish Both mode Does one pass through [TestList] in serial mode Does one pass through [TestList] in parallel mode Reads iterations for that test and starts loop Reads threads for that test, and if >1 starts appropriate number of threads Stress mode Runs parallel mode from above As each test thread returns, sleep for the specified interval under  SleepBetweenRun  and spawns a thread which runs the test again How do log files get cleaned up or saved If a LogFile is specified in your [test] section, the logging mechanism will write to this file during the test, and then send it to  server  set in the [LogServer] section of the ini file. How does logging work See Logging Doc How to use driver verifier Since NT s driver verifier must be configured by setting the registry key and there is no registry in XBox. We have modified the NT executive to read driver verifier s settings from loader parameter block. The parameters are similar to the registry version. For example, the key Verify=drivername.sys, VerifyLevel=3 will be appeared as Xboxldr.com /debug /verify= *.sys  /verifylevel=27 /ioverifylevel=2 Please see verifier.doc for more information regarding driver verifier settings. What should your test do Your test needs to do the following: Export void WINAPI StartTest(HANDLE LogHandle) This is your test entry point It must be thread safe It must use the log handle passed in It must return only if all tests are done Do not call TerminateThread or ExitThread in StartTest Export void WINAPI EndTest(void) If you need to do any cleanup, do it here It must be thread safe Do not call TerminateThread or ExitThread in EndTest Remember, it is only called 1 time each time your test is called, NOT 1 time per thread if your test is running multiple threads. Each test must create its own heap using HeapCreate, allocate using HeapAlloc, HeapReAlloc, and free/destroy heap using HeapFree and HeapDestroy. Do not use GlobalAlloc/LocalAlloc, which will be default process heap. How to run test harness As of 4/25/2000, there is no way to configure XBox to load the test harness. To force XAPI to load the harness, you have to set special environment variable as shown below and re-build XAPI E:\xbox\private\ntos\xapi>SET ALT_PROJECT=XBOXTEST E:\xbox\private\ntos\xapi>bcz We will change this ugly hack as soon as the title loader code is ready Debugging Tips You can add DebugVerbose=1 under [GeneralSettings] section to enable printing debug messages to kernel debugger You can add BreaksBeforeLoadTestModule=1 under [GeneralSettings] section to break into kernel debugger everytime the harness tries to load) test modules. What other magic do we need for stress / leak detection / corruption detection Future features: More support for Driver verifier (driver verifier monitor like verifier.exe?) And other cool things

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8TCPIP TEST SUITE SPECIFICATION TitleTCPIP TEST SUITE SPECIFICATION Normal Microsoft Word 9.0bjbjU TCPIP TEST SUITE SPECIFICATION (ICMP, ARP, IP, TCP , UDP ,IGMP  & Router Discovery ) TCPIP Test Team  Version 2.0: Revision History: Bama Ramarathnam (bamar) July 2,1997 (Added more test cases to the original TCPIP regression test suite) Balash Akbari (balasha) May 20, 1998 IP fragmentation cases for reassemble was added Balash Akbari (balasha) August 14, 1998 Dead Gateway Detection cases were added Balash Akbari (balasha) January 8, 1999 New cases was added for ARP Balash Akbari (Balasha) June 03, 1999 Cases for DHCP configuration for Router Discovery was added Balash Akbari (Balasha) October 09, 1999 General test case clean up IGMP V1 and IGMP V2 was merged TCPIP Test Specification : Introduction The TCPIP Protocol Suite includes not only the TCP and  IP protocols but also ICMP , ARP ,UDP and IGMP. This test plan Specification covers all the above areas. The goal of this document  is to provide information about the different tests which are run on the TCPIP stack in NT5.0 .  Most of these tests were also run on Win95 and NT4.0. Further versions of this document will add more details to the test plan and add additional test cases to consider. This document covers the tests performed which a mention about how these tests are performed but does not go into detail about the way the tests are done. Features that are tested  The specification covers the following areas: Wireless Media Registry Parameters Router Discovery Coverage The tests cover all the basic functionality of the TCPIP Stack and also checks compatibility with systems having different TCPIP implementations and options. All new features added to the stack will be part of this test plan once they have been unit tested and integrated into the stack. The specification also includes boundary/special conditions with emphasis on tests which attack the system. The tests should also check special configurations and different media like Token Ring, FDDI etc. At present the tests are semi-automated but work is on to automate them. Functionality Testing The tests for the different protocols is as follows:  ICMP   ICMP Reply for valid Requests only  Ping to unicast address   expected a response Ping to allnet broadcast address 255.255.255.255   no response and no net traffic Ping to 0.0.0.0   expected no response Ping to subnet broadcast a.b.255.255   expected no response Ping multicast address   expected no response Ping loopback address ( 127.0.0.1)   expected a response but no net traffic Check response on receiving a ICMP packet with the source address a multicast address, broadcast address or  0.0.0.0  or a.b.255.255 or loopback address   ICMP Invalid Header Fields / Bad Packets Send a packet with incorrect checksum value of 0 , FFFF Send packets with invalid values in the type field  of 0 ,FF , 02 Send packets with invalid values in the code field of FF , F0   ICMP Address mask Request / Reply Check to see if the host is able to find its subnet mask   send a address mask request to the all net broadcast and the subnet broadcast  - check response for correct subnet mask   ICMP Timestamp Request/Reply Send a request to a unicast address   expected a response Send a request to the  subnet broadcast   expected no response Send a  request to the allnet broadcast   expected no response   ICMP Redirect  Send a message to a host A through router RI. Let R1 send a redirect message with the next hop now being R2. Check if the routing table is updated and the next message to A is sent to R2. Now send another redirect message changing the router for Destination A to R1. Check if the routing table is updated. Have the router R1 send a network redirect (after the above test) and check the routing table of the hosts connected to that subnet ICMP Destination Unreachable Check to see if the host sends, port unreachable, destination unreachable messages and host unreachable.   ICMP Parameter Problem Fragmentation and Forwarding Send a fragmented ICMP packet from A to B and check if the reassembly works fine Send a fragmented ICMP packet from A to B through router R which also fragments the packet further (MTU varies over the different nets) and check if reassembly works fine. Send a fragmented ICMP packet with the packets having overlapping data bytes / and non-overlapping data with a few bytes missing. (Send a large amount of data ) Currently no tool to test directly.

able to communicate between a Intel and Alpha platform Interoperability with different Media Check that the protocol works for different media like Ethernet , Token Ring , Wireless media  it works correctly. Regression and Stress Tests At present some of the regression tests are manual and work is being done to automate them. There are tools to stress the stack and if any new tests are to be added to the stress test they will be integrated with the existing tests. Stress tools for bombarding the stack with  packets are being developed. Other Information Tests for PnP and IPSEC are in separate Test Specifications Some of the tests have to be implemented and integrated with the existing regression test suite There are separate documents with details on how the tests are performed for specific components Tools Using MUPPET & WALDO to send bad packets Use sockets to send bad frames   for stress tests Issues Check limit on the size of the first IP fragment   the check is not in presently but maybe added and so this test maybe be added later Test on Serial and LAN types of adapters    any special tests? Serial: can do with null modem ? Test on the firewall issues: need to come up with test cases New TCPIP registry parameters for the SYN Attack   need to get details and include test cases PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential

dictates a complicated scene? Multiple dialogs/sound tracks selection Play different screen sizes (4:3 vs. 16:9), and verify the fallback order (if you have your default set to 4:3Letterbox, but the DVD only has 4:3Normal) Using different A/V packs Dolby Digital 5.1 output Play PC-compatible DVDs (playing DVDs with Windows programs with extra features, but not playing the extra features)  Spec reviews You should also read the shell specs on: HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\shell" file://xbox/specs/pm/shell Tools needed Most, if not all, of the UI testing will be done by hand; automating the testing would be expensive and time intensive to setup.  The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need the tools which are covered below.   Software Needed: A DVD loaded with a  Complicated scene , wether that s a specifically created scenario program that generates massive audio and visual data, or just a DVD that happens to have a scene that fits that criteria is still unknown. A tool that would allow us to simulate low disk space situations for the Xdisk. For completeness of testing.  A DVD loaded with an extreme amount of  Sub-menus  that branch off of the root menu, to test functionality as the number gets ridiculously huge.  We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed: At least 1 Xbox. Controllers, up to 4 per Xbox. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL formats. All supported Xbox A/V packs. A/V receiver(s) capable of PCM, and Dolby Digital (AC-3) 5.1 speakers (for Dolby Digital output) CD burner capable of CD-RW, Audio, Enhanced, and Mixed CD s, to create custom test CDs. DVD-R Burner DVD Stamper, if available DVD Player (Consumer-level)   Must support same A/V outputs of the Xbox for test comparison.

The tools we will need to perform UI testing is minimal.  Hardware tools are covered below We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed Controllers, up to 4 per test machine. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL formats. All supported Xbox A/V packs. Test methods Test code If there is time permitting, there will be test code written that will test the underlying engine that the UI is running on.  If we can ensure that the underlying engine is solid, it will save time in the future if UI has to be changed late in the testing/release process. Manual tests Error Messages These tests invoke each possible error message that the Dashboard will display.  Those messages that are covered by other test areas will be called out in this plan. Generic Error Message How do we invoke this? Can we invoke this? Media Read Error Insert a disc other than an Xbox Game, DVD Movie, or Audio CD, and verify the user is presented with this message What types of media can/should we use for this test? Corrupted C Drive Tests   Boot with following in tray: NOTHING Xbox Game DVD DVD Movie Verify Memory Block information is displayed correctly when the user has a corrupted C Partition on the Xbox Hard Disk Verify Copying a Saved Game displays the proper error message when the C Partition is corrupt Verify Copying Music displays the proper error message when the C Partition is corrupt Memory Unit Errors (These errors and tests will be displayed by the Memory Management tests) Remove a Memory Unit during a Copy / Delete operation User erases an MU (they are prompted with an  are you sure  message) Erasing an MU Fails How do we make this happen? Attempt to copy data to an MU that does not have enough space available Attempt to copy data to the Hard Disk that does not have enough space available MU is bad (Dash recognizes a problem with the MU file system) Is this error moot because of our automatic erase? User deletes a Saved Game (they are prompted with an  are you sure  message) Dashboard is writing to a memory unit (Copying a Saved Game to a Memory Unit) Dashboard is writing to the Hard Disk (Copying a Saved Game / Song to the Hard Disk) User attempts to copy a Saved Game to the Hard Disk from a new Game, and the Hard Disk has 4096 games already on it Parental Control Errors (These errors are covered by the Parental Control test plan) Game rating exceeds the parental control setting Movie rating exceeds the parental control setting Storage Errors A user inserts a new Xbox game, and the Xbox fails to configure the Hard Disk. (This can be simulated by filling up the Xbox, and trying to play a new game?) Factory Reset   User initiates a  Recovery  from within the Dashboard, and they are prompted with an  Are you sure  message User tries to launch a game that doesn t have enough hard disk space to run. How do we simulate this?  How does the Dashboard / Kernel know this?  Does the Game Title boot to the Dash telling the Dash how much space it needs? Music / Soundtrack Errors (These errors and tests will be displayed by the Memory Management tests) User tries to create more than 100 soundtracks User tries to add more than 500 tracks to one soundtrack User runs out of Disk space when trying to create a Soundtrack User runs out of Disk space when trying to copy a track Region Errors User inserts an Xbox Game from a different Game Region.

If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Boot up time to Default Title Game Portal Game Portal navigation Start a new game from Game Portal Start a saved game from Game Portal Audio CD playback DVD playback DVD menu navigation Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.

User wishes to delete saved games that s/he is no longer interested in. User wishes to delete all saved games out of a specific Memory Area. User wishes to delete all saved games pertaining to a specific title. User goes to play a game, and the game informs the user that they do not have enough space to play.  The user is then sent to the Default Title to clear out some space. During various operations the user is performing with their Memory Areas, they decide to quit (power down). During various operations the user is performing with their Memory Areas, the power goes out.  (Unplug the box) Spec reviews You should also read the shell specs on: file://xbox/specs/pm/shell Tools needed Most, if not all, of the UI testing will be done by hand because automating the testing will be expensive and we may not have the time to do it.  The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need to simulate some out of space scenarios, etc, which will require either some software to be developed that will quickly generate this scenario, or an easy way to fill up a Memory Area without the need for software.  Hardware tools are covered below.  Here are some software tools we will need: An Xbox Title that will reboot in to the Xdash, as if the user needed to perform storage clean up.  (Specifying various size requirements) A tool that will allow me to compare two files to ensure they are identical.  (Such as windiff).  I will need to be able to compare that data that will live on an MU.  If it s not possible to copy this data to the PC for comparison, a   program will have to be created that works on the Xbox. A tool that would allow us to simulate low disk space situations for both MU s and Xdisk.  This tool may have to be an  Xbox Title  in order to access MU We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed At least 1 Xbox. Controllers, up to 4 per Xbox. Memory Units (standard size), at least 8 per Xbox. Memory Units (larger sizes), for future compatibility testing. An Xbox compatible hard disk that is larger than the standard 8MB we will be shipping, for future compatibility testing. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL formats. Test methods Test code Due to the fact that we cannot simulate USB input programmatically, and we cannot get information back out of the Xbox, no test code will be written to automate the testing. The test cases, steps, and variations WILL be written in C++ and executed on the Xbox so that if automation is possible, the test cases and steps are already in the proper location and format. Manual tests User Interface These tests are to ensure that the user interface of the Memory Management area of the Xdash can handle the types of issues that arise when dealing with Memory Management. Types of tests that will NOT be performed are: Testing any title specific UI that needs to be presented to the end user when a failure, or title boot scenario occurs (Out of space during a save, Memory Management Needed, etc). Types of tests that will be performed are: Each message the Memory Management area can display will be called out through the various UI and functionality test cases.  ALL text must be displayed.  4 Controllers plugged in, in various combinations, with various combinations of MU s plugged in to them (i.e., empty, only 1 MU inserted, 2 MU s inserted, etc) Verify the proper amount of space is displayed when highlighting each MU Memory Area that is: empty, 1 block used, half of the blocks used, all blocks save 1 used, and full. Verify the proper amount of space is displayed when highlighting the Hard Drive Memory Area that is: empty, 1 block used, half of the blocks used, all blocks save 1 used, and full. If MU s have a nickname associated with them, verify that it is displayed properly with nicknames that are: empty, 1 char, MAX   1 char, MAX chars, and MAX + 1 chars.  Invalid chars (if possible) will also be used. Mixed Memory Areas, some full, some empty, both MU s and the Hard Drive.   Depending on the screen layout, this may not be necessary NAV: Verify the Navigation on all Memory Area screens and dialogs is consistent and concise. NAV: Verify that all dialogs have a  cancel HP: Verify the UI is updated when an MU is Hot-Plugged, or Un-Plugged while in the UI. HP: Verify the UI is updated when a controller is Hot-Plugged, or Un-Plugged, while in the UI. Verify that any wrapping that can occur is displayed properly.  (i.e., the number of Saved Games a title has will cause wrapping, etc) Verify that the Saved Games are sorted in a meaningful order (i.e., most recent save is at the top, etc) Verify appropriate dialogs are displayed when trying to save a game to a Memory Area with no space available. Verify appropriate dialogs are displayed when trying to copy a game to a Memory Area with no space available. BOOT: Verify a title can boot the Xbox sending the user to the Memory Management Area, and specifying how much space they need to be free, sending values such as: 0, 1, MAX   1, MAX. (CD still in drive) BOOT: Verify a title can boot the Xbox sending the user to the Memory Management Area, and specifying how much space they need to be free. (User removes CD mid-boot)  BOOT: Verify a title can boot the Xbox sending the user to the Memory Management Area, and specifying how much space they need to be free. (User removes CD after boot) Functionality These tests are to ensure that the operations the Xdash performs while in the Memory Management Area are successful, and are working as intended.   Types of tests that will NOT be performed are: Copying files from ALL Memory Locations to every other Memory Location and verifying that the copy was successful. (By inspecting the File System or File integrity) Testing the File System API s related to Memory Location copies to verify that they successfully copy the files with accuracy. Testing the File System API s to verify security in regards to which titles are, and are not allowed to use them. Types of tests that will be performed are: Copy files from an MU to the Hard Drive, and verify the save was successful, using files of size: 0, 1, MAX_SIZE   1, MAX_SIZE., MAX_SIZE + 1. (Requires file level verification) Copy files from the Hard Drive to an MU, and verify the save was successful, using files of size: 0, 1, MAX_SIZE   1, MAX_SIZE, MAX_SIZE + 1. (Requires file level verification) Copy files from each Memory Area to every other Memory Area, using files of size: 0, 1, MAX_SIZE   1, MAX_SIZE, MAX_SIZE + 1, then navigating to the destination area and verify the proper information is displayed. Deleting individual saved games from each Memory Area, and verifying that the UI has been updated. Deleting individual saved games from each Memory Area, and verifying that if the same file exists on other MA s, they are not deleted. Deleting all files from a Memory Area, and verifying that the UI properly reflects the empty Memory Area. HP: Verify the Xdash can handle it when you remove an MU while a game is being Saved, Copied, or Deleted to it. HP: Verify the Xdash can handle it when you Remove a controller while a game is being Saved, Copied, or Deleted, to one of it HP: Verify the Xdash can handle it when you Remove an MU while working with the Memory Area. HP: Verify the Xdash can handle it when you Remove a controller while working with a Memory Area that is plugged in to the controller. Verify that if the user is Coping or Deleting a file from any of the Memory Locations, that when the Power is switched off via the Power button, the Xbox finishes the operation. Verify that if you are Coping or Deleting a file from any of the Memory Locations, that when the Power is removed (Xbox unplugged), the files are either not there, or if they are there, verify they can be safely deleted. Code reviews For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship.  If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Debugger must be hooked up to the text machine during testing.  If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Copy times between Memory Areas. (MU s to Hard Drive, MU s to MU s, and Hard Drive to MU Memory Management menu navigation Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.  If data is lost or the hard disk becomes corrupted, verify that the Default Title can be recovered from the recovery disc. Interfaces with other components Titles must be able to boot the Xbox in a mode that ignores what is in the tray, and places the user in to the Memory Management area.  They must also be able to specify how much space they need in order to function.  We will test this by creating a title that will boot in to the Memory Management area specifying various amounts of space needed. Localization impact All test cases will be executed on every language we support to verify everything is localized correctly and there is no clipping.  When text can be entered, always use extended characters and Japanese characters.  Usage testing will cover English alphabets. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for the Default Title to be declared  test complete Release criteria All tests must pass at 100%.  The only exceptions will be bugs that the War Team declares as postponed, won t fix, or by design.

If we can ensure that the underlying engine is solid, it will save time in the future if UI has to be changed late in the testing/release process. Manual tests Boot sequence This is to test to make sure that the boot sequence works as designed and that the sequence cannot be worked around.  We will cover the features that are related to the Default Title.  For example, we won t test things like: Plug in power cord, make sure you can eject the disc tray, while the power is off. Plug in power cord, make sure you can eject the disc tray, while the power is on. Plugged in, power off, Tray empty: Verify that when powered on, boot sequence appears, and Default Title is started (whether the tray is open or not). Plugged in power off, power on with the following media in the tray, when the tray is closed or open, with controllers plugged in various ports, or not plugged in at all: Games: Xbox retail game disc   starts game Games with different rating and with different parental control settings (online or local) Games with or without XDash data for the game portal, (bmps, WMAs, 3D model for the portal)   Boot Sequence? Xbox retail game disc from a multi-disc Xbox game (not the start disc)   display appropriate error message asking for appropriate disc Xbox game disc with a beta signature   Does not start, brings up default title. Xbox game disc without ANY signature   Does not start, brings up default title.

We will cover the features that are related to the Default Title.  For example, we won t test things like: Whether or not a game can write to the hard disk an incorrect amount of saved games. Whether or not the game can update high scores directly (without going through the Xzone) Types of things we will test are: Verify that games can be removed from the Xbox   How/Where?? The Navigation for all Games sub-areas. Verify consistency (B is always back, A is always select, etc) Verify that each selection takes you to the proper location Games Collection Menu Verify that if N, 1, or ZERO games have been played / installed on the Xbox, that the games area screens display the correct data. Verify that if the Xbox hard drive is full, the Xdash prompts the user for clean up. Verify games that have MAX, MAX   1, MIN and ZERO length titles display correctly in the appropriate games area screens. Verify that if games have MAX + 1 length titles, the Xdash doesn t explode. Need to find out the teaser information info from victor. Game Enhancements Menu Verify games that have MAX, MAX   1, MIN and ZERO length titles display correctly in the appropriate games area screens. Verify that games can specify which  enhancements  they wish their game to expose (i.e. Game Updates, but not High Scores, etc) Verify that no matter what the game exposes for updates that the navigation is correct. Specific Game Enhancement Menu Play Enhancement Verify games that have the MAX, MAX   1, MIN or ZERO saved games that the games area screens display the correct data. Verify that if the Xbox hard drive is full, playing an EXISTING game gives the user the proper  clean up  message.   what is that message? Verify that if the Xbox hard drive is full, playing a NEW game gives the user the proper  clean up  message.   what is that message? TBD: Need to get info from Victor Xbox settings Please see the spec checked in to  test\docs\Xbox Default Title   Settings Area Test Plan.doc CD audio playback Please see the spec checked in to  test\docs\Xbox Default Title   Music Area Test Plan.doc Memory Management Please see the spec checked in to  test\docs\Xbox Default Title   Memory Management Test Plan.doc DVD Playback Different DVDs will be required to verify XBox's mpeg decoder's performance.  Some consumer-level DVD players can't play some of the newer and more complicated titles (e.g., Matrix).  DVDs from different zones (and non-zoned discs) will be checked.  The DVD Player UI will also be checked. A wide range of DVD titles will be needed to cover compatibility and the DVD menu (e.g. choose a different chapter, title, time). Features to be tested: Choose among the different options Navigation between controls and choices Choose different features and chapters Play Back Test the following: Play from beginning to the end Play in Repeat mode Click on click-able object while movie is playing (e.g., the Rabbit mode in Matrix) FF/REW 2x, 4x, 8x play Stop/pause Pause/Slow motion forward and reverse Frame by frame forward and reverse Next chapter/previous chapter (and title) While: Playing Fast forwarding Rewinding 2x or higher play Stopped Paused Slow motion forward and reverse Frame by frame forward and reverse Next chapter Previous chapter Playing at first chapter Playing at the last chapter Choose chapter from DVD menu Display Closed Caption (in English, Japanese, and Latin languages) Display credits, actor/actress bios, trailers etc. Play DVDs from different zones, or DVDs that are not zoned Performance on CPU/decoder while playing complicated scenes   What dictates a complicated scene? Multiple dialogs/sound tracks selection Play different screen sizes (4:3 vs. 16:9), and verify the fallback order (if you have your default set to 4:3Letterbox, but the DVD only has 4:3Normal) Using different A/V packs Dolby Digital 5.1 output Play PC-compatible DVDs (DVDs with Windows programs with extra features)   This is not possible, correct? Game Portal  need more specific details. Need to do some spec research and fill this in. Configuration tests The following configurations will be covered: All tests will be cover in each of the 6 supported languages Different CD and DVD types Different A/V packs with different TVs (4:3, 16:9, NTSC, PAL) Different A/V packs with different Audio Output (Dolby Digital, PCM) Different sized memory cards Different sized hard disks (for future expansion compatibility testing)   Are we still doing this? Cards that are placed in different controllers (e.g. card is in controller 2, but not controller 1) Different sized cards in different slots Controllers in different slots (e.g., Controller in port 2, but not in port 1, or Controllers in ports 2, 3, and 4, but not 1) Tray opened / closed when booted Network cable plugged in / not plugged in. Network active / not active (e.g. Cable plugged in, but no DHCP server available, Hub/Port disabled, etc) Code reviews For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship.  If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Debugger must be hooked up to the text machine during testing.  If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. t shell security covered sufficiently by the  Parental Control  section?  Is there more security than this? Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Boot up time to Default Title Game Portal Game Portal navigation Start a new game from Game Portal Start a saved game from Game Portal Audio CD playback DVD playback DVD menu navigation Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.  If data is lost or the hard disk becomes corrupted, verify that the Default Title can be recovered from the recovery disc. Interfaces with other components What other components does the default title interface with? Localization impact All test cases will be executed on every language we support to verify everything is localized correctly and there is no clipping.  When text can be entered, always use extended characters and Japanese characters.  English alphabets will be covered by usage testing. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for the Default Title to be declared  test complete Release criteria All tests must pass at 100%.  The only exceptions will be bugs that the War Team declares as postponed, won t fix, or by design. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential

The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need to simulate some out of space scenarios, etc, which will require either some software to be developed that will quickly generate this scenario, or an easy way to fill up a Music Area without the need for software.  Hardware tools are covered below.  Here are some software tools we will need: A tool that would allow us to simulate low disk space situations for Xdisk.   A tool that will allow us to configure the Xdisk in various ways, such as creating many  Titles , or many sound track for a specific Title.  We will need to perform cleanup from this tool as well, so we can ensure the Xbox is setup appropriately. We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed At least 1 Xbox. Least 1 Controllers, Max up to 4 per Xbox. An Xbox compatible hard disk that is larger than the standard 8GB we will be shipping, for future compatibility testing. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL S-VIDEO and Composite formats. A/V Pack Regular Music CDs (Off the Shelf version) Regular size CD (Album size) Small size CD ( about 8  size) Odd shape CD (normally 8  in size) CD that has Audio and PC Data Music CDs (Created by the User) Burn on the CD-RW Media CD format CD that contain a Audio track of total of 99 track CD that contain a 1 track with very long music (Max track length) CD w/ Data on the track 1, audio track on after.

The test cases, steps, and variations will be stored in TACTICS, which will allow us to easily assign test cases to a specific tester, review results, and update information as needed.  See   HYPERLINK "http://xdk"  http://xdk  for more information on our TACTICS database. Manual tests General Music Collection User Interface These tests are to ensure that the user interface of the Music Area of the Xdash can handle the types of issues that arise when dealing with Music Area.  These tests will be run on EVERY screen in the Music Area Types of tests that will be performed are: Verify navigation works as expected: Verify INVALID controls/buttons perform no action X Button, Y Button WHITE Button, BLACK Button RIGHT TRIGGER Button, LEFT TRIGGER Button DPAD Left & Right Button RIGHT THUMB-STICK Button, LEFT THUMB-STICK Button (Push the buttion) RIGHT THUMB-STICK (Up, Down, Left and Right ) Left Thumb-Stick Moving Left & Right Verify VALID controls/buttons perform appropriate action A Button, Start Button B Button, Stop Button Dpad (Up and Down) Left Thumb (Up and Down) Verify a combination of the INVALID controls / buttons perform no action Verify that Multiple Control press combinations do not adversely affect the XDash, such as: A & B Start & Back A & Start B & Start B & Back A & Back And more in the test cases. Verify the FOCUS is always set to the proper menu item 0 Soundtrack Title with No Audio CD 0 Soundtrack Title with Audio CD  1 Soundtrack Title with No Audio CD 1 Soundtrack Title with Audio CD 8+ Soundtrack Titles with No Audio CD 8+ Soundtrack Titles with Audio CD MAX (100) Soundtrack Titles with No Audio CD MAX (100) Soundtrack Titles with Audio CD Verify that scrolling UP and DOWN the menu items performs as expected Verify that All the UI is properly displayed in the screen. (Such as word is been cut off from the edge of the screen, images is correctly displayed on the screen.) Verify that UI and text (for all supported Xbox languages) when selecting / highlighting each menu and ensure that correctness of the localization.

User wishes to delete saved games that s/he is no longer interested in. User wishes to delete all saved games out of a specific Memory Area. User wishes to delete all saved games pertaining to a specific title. User goes to play a game, and the game informs the user that they do not have enough space to play.  The user is then sent to the Default Title to clear out some space. During various operations the user is performing with their Memory Areas, they decide to quit (power down). During various operations the user is performing with their Memory Areas, the power goes out.  (Unplug the box) Spec reviews You should also read the shell specs on: file://xbox/specs/pm/shell Tools needed Most, if not all, of the UI testing will be done by hand because automating the testing will be expensive and we may not have the time to do it.  The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need to simulate some out of space scenarios, etc, which will require either some software to be developed that will quickly generate this scenario, or an easy way to fill up a Memory Area without the need for software.  Hardware tools are covered below.  Here are some software tools we will need: An Xbox Title that will reboot in to the Xdash, as if the user needed to perform storage clean up.  (Specifying various size requirements) A tool that will allow me to compare two files to ensure they are identical.  (Such as windiff).  I will need to be able to compare that data that will live on an MU.  If it s not possible to copy this data to the PC for comparison, a   program will have to be created that works on the Xbox. A tool that would allow us to simulate low disk space situations for both MU s and Xdisk.  This tool may have to be an  Xbox Title  in order to access MU We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed At least 1 Xbox. Controllers, up to 4 per Xbox. Memory Units (standard size), at least 8 per Xbox. Memory Units (larger sizes), for future compatibility testing. An Xbox compatible hard disk that is larger than the standard 8MGB we will be shipping, for future compatibility testing. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL formats. Test methods Test code Tools will be developed to generate  Saved Games  on the Xbox, as well as to simulate  Out of disk space  scenarios on the Xbox. Manual tests User Interface These tests are to ensure that the user interface of the Memory Management area of the Xdash can handle the types of issues that arise when dealing with Memory Management.  These tests will be run on EVERY screen in the Memory Area. Types of tests that will NOT be performed are: Testing any title specific UI that needs to be presented to the end user when a failure, or title boot scenario occurs (Out of space during a save, Memory Management Needed, etc). Types of tests that will be performed are: Verify navigation works as expected: Verify INVALID controls/buttons perform no action Verify VALID controls/buttons perform appropriate action Verify that Multiple Control press combinations do not adversely affect the XDash, such as: A & B Start & Back A & Start B & Start B & Back A & Back (may need more cases here) Verify the FOCUS is always set to the proper menu item Verify that scrolling UP and DOWN the menu items performs as expected Verify that All the UI is properly displayed in the screen. (Such as word is been cut off from the edge of the screen, images is correctly displayed on the screen.) Verify that UI and text (for all supported Xbox languages) when selecting / highlighting each menu and ensure that correctness of the localization.  Each message the Memory Management area can display will be called out through the various UI and functionality test cases.  ALL text must be displayed.

If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Debugger must be hooked up to the text machine during testing.  If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Copy times between Memory Areas. (MU s to Hard Drive, MU s to MU s, and Hard Drive to MU Memory Management menu navigation Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.  If data is lost or the hard disk becomes corrupted, verify that the Default Title can be recovered from the recovery disc. Interfaces with other components Titles must be able to boot the Xbox in a mode that ignores what is in the tray, and places the user in to the Memory Management area.  They must also be able to specify how much space they need in order to function.  We will test this by creating a title that will boot in to the Memory Management area specifying various amounts of space needed. Localization impact All test cases will be executed on every language we support to verify everything is localized correctly and there is no clipping.  When text can be entered, always use extended characters and Japanese characters.  Usage testing will cover English alphabets. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for the Default Title to be declared  test complete Release criteria All tests must pass at 100%.  The only exceptions will be bugs that the War Team declares as postponed, won t fix, or by design. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential ~o~^oSo gdP'^ gdP'^ gdP'^ gdP'^ gdP'^ wqwqmwqwbwq

The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need to simulate some out of space scenarios, etc, which will require either some software to be developed that will quickly generate this scenario, or an easy way to fill up a Game Area without the need for software.  Hardware tools are covered below.  Here are some software tools we will need: A tool that will allow me to compare two files to ensure they are identical.  (Such as windiff).  I will need to be able to compare that data that will live on an MU.  If it s not possible to copy this data to the PC for comparison, a   program will have to be created that works on the Xbox. A tool that would allow us to simulate low disk space situations for both MU s and Xdisk.  This tool may have to be an  Xbox Title  in order to access MU A tool that will allow us to configure the Xdisk and the Mus in various ways, such as creating many  Titles , or many saved games for a specific Title.  We will need to perform cleanup from this tool as well, so we can ensure the Xbox is setup appropriately. We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed At least 1 Xbox. Controllers, up to 4 per Xbox. Memory Units (standard size), at least 8 per Xbox. Memory Units (larger sizes), for future compatibility testing. An Xbox compatible hard disk that is larger than the standard 8MB we will be shipping, for future compatibility testing. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL S-VIDEO and Composite formats. 2 Game DVDs (Xbox) (1st disc from a multi-disc game), from different games Game DVD (Xbox) (2nd disc from a multi-disc game) Test methods Test code Due to the fact that we cannot simulate USB input programmatically, and we cannot get information back out of the Xbox, no test code will be written to automate the testing. The test cases, steps, and variations will be stored in TACTICS, which will allow us to easily assign test cases to a specific tester, review results, and update information as needed.  See   HYPERLINK "http://xdk"  http://xdk  for more information on our TACTICS database. Manual tests General Game Area User Interface These tests are to ensure that the user interface of the Game Area of the Xdash can handle the types of issues that arise when dealing with Game Area.

Cancel  Verify that upon the canceling any function (such one like copying, deleting saved game files) should returning a user to lists of the saved game on the currently selected game title. Code reviews For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship.  If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Debugger must be hooked up to the text machine during testing.  If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Switch back and forth between Main Dash to the Game Collection Menu. Switch back and forth between of Game collection and rest of the menu that are related to the game area. Scrolling up and down on the list of game collection titles and saved game in Xdisk and memory unit(s). Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.  If data is lost or the hard disk becomes corrupted, verify that the Default Title can be recovered from the recovery disc. Interfaces with other components Titles must be able to boot the Xbox in a mode that ignores what is in the tray, and places the user in to the Game Area.  Localization impact All test cases will be executed on every language we support to verify everything is localized correctly and there is no clipping.  When text can be entered, always use extended characters and Japanese characters.  Usage testing will cover English alphabets. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for the Default Title to be declared  test complete Release criteria All tests must pass at 100%.  The only exceptions will be bugs that the War Team declares as postponed, won t fix, or by design. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential gdMHh gdMHh gdMHh gdMHh gd|!F gdyTF gdyTF

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox DEFAULT TITLE   Release Criteria TitleXbox DEFAULT TITLE   Release Criteria jimhelm Normal.dot jimhelm Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceType urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PlaceName urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags placebjbjk Xbox default title   Release Criteria This document contains the criteria for which test will allow the release of the Xbox Default Title.  It is important that all teams involved in the building and shipping process of the Default Title acknowledge and understand these criteria. Release Criteria No Pri 1 Sev 1 bugs.  These are bugs that will cause either an extremely bad user experience, or are straight-line failures. A straight-line failure is a failure such that a normal user will hit it performing a standard, non-edge case scenario. (Such as copying a saved game, changing a setting, etc)  No severe visual problems, such as overflowing text, or missing or hidden items.  Any text that would normally overflow must be properly faded to convey that the text size was expected by the product, and dealt with in the appropriate way.  It is important that the product look polished as well as perform its functions.  A sloppy interface will not only cause confusion, but convey a general feel of sloppiness in the overall Xbox product.  This applies to ALL languages that the Xbox supports.   No Memory leaks.  Since the Xbox will launch the Default Title each time the user presses the eject button, it is a very likely scenario that the user will be leaving their box running it for prolonged periods of time.  It is very important that the Default Title does not 'crash' or 'freeze' the system, no matter how long the user has it running.  It is also extremely important that performing basic actions, such as Copying saved games, removing items, playing music, etc, do not leak. All War-Team approved bugs must be fixed, and regressed before release. End Game Test Schedule: 0 days Development Code Complete 7 days Test Pass #1 2 days Address bugs from Test Pass #1 (Fix and Regress) 1 day Full Team Default Title Bug-Bash, to find any ad-hoc type scenarios not found in Test Pass #1. 7 days Test Pass #2 (Final, FULL, test pass) 3 days Fix any Pri 1 Sev 1, and War-Team approved bugs before launch (Bugs that were found by Test Pass #2).  This time will be used for targeted regression passes against areas where Pri 1 or Pri 2 bugs had to be fixed. 1 day Last day of Ad-hoc testing, hopefully involving full-team.  This is a sanity pass to try and make sure there was nothing major missed by Pass #1 or #2 above. Total Time needed: 21 days (3 weeks) This is an extremely aggressive schedule considering the complexity of the Default Title and the amount of tests that we need to run against it.  Because of the Default Title engine, even a minor tweak or bug fix in one area can affect all other areas in the product.  It is EXTREMELY important that, in these last 3 weeks, we ONLY fix bugs that absolutely need fixing before launch, and that we DO NOT add any new features whatsoever   we must really be CODE COMPLETE to start this process.  If we are adding any major new item within this 3 week period, in my opinion, we would need to start this process over from the beginning. I would expect, although this number is subject to War-Team bug approval, that 95% to 97% of all of our Default Title tests would be passing before we should ship this product. vgvc_c_cWc_RWMEcR

Hardware needed What do you need immediately? What will you need further on down the road? What lab requirements do you have? Test methodology All aforementioned APIs, regardless of type, can all be categorized into four common API  types  which can be tested in a similar manner across the board.  The testing methodology will be described using the following model: Allocators & Deallocators: These functions share the common responsibility of creating / reserving locations of memory for general program use which includes custom heaps.  Basic Functionality: Testing the basic functionality will involve simple memory allocation calls of a fixed size. Verification will include the use of functions such as  ZeroMemory  to touch the allocated region of memory and monitoring the systems response.  Some exceptions will be expected. For example; certain protection types will raise an exception when the test code  touches  that protected allocated region. Test code will be written to handle these expected exceptions. Boundary Conditions: Memory management boundary conditions will simply be accomplished by allocating small blocks of memory (i.e. less than a page in size) and verifying its creation, as well as cases that will consume all system memory.  Heap related Allocators will be tested by continuously creating heaps until it has reached the system capacity and monitoring the expected results.  This will be sufficient to test the allocation API boundary conditions. Error Conditions: Error conditions will be handled by; Creating a block of memory / freeing it / touching the freed address and handling the expected exception to occur.  Requesting a region of memory that is not usable by the program and monitoring the expected exception to occur. Localization: No localization testing will be performed on the memory manager APIs Security: Cases related to security will include mostly the manipulation of access flags and ensuring they guard the memory as expected. Performance: No performance testing is planned as yet.  TBD Access Protection Modifiers: Basic Functionality: Ensuring basic functionality will involve taking an allocated block of memory with a predetermined access protection type, modifying it using the access protection modifying APIs, and verifying it using a respective query API (such as  VirtualQuery Boundary Conditions: Boundary conditions do not apply to access protection modifiers. Error Conditions:  Error condition testing is somewhat limited with these APIs.  The functions that modify protection attributes are pretty much a pass / fail process. Error cases will include; Modifying a region of memory that cannot be modified. Passing invalid region sizes. When changing the protection attribute of a given region, give the function call the incorrect   protection type. Attempting to change the protection type on a region smaller than 1 page (4096 bytes). Localization: No localization testing will be necessary. Security: Any security issues will be exposed through the basic functionality and error cases. Performance: No performance testing will be performed on these APIs. Query Functions:  Basic Functionality:  Testing of these APIs will begin by allocating memory of all types ( heaps, virtual memory, etc ) with different protection settings ( PAGE_GUARD, PAGE_READ, etc ), filling the appropriate memory information structure, and comparing the results to the expected values. Boundary Conditions: No boundary testing is necessary for query functions. Error Conditions: Error cases are mostly focused on passing NULL or invalid query parameters ( this is mostly specific to VirtualQuery( ) ) and ensuring proper API error handling.  For other simple query functions ( such as HeapSize and LocalSize ), a more basic approach will be taken by querying invalid heap handles and checking the return values. Localization: No localization testing necessary. Security:  Security will be tested by attempting to query a region of memory that has been guarded by protection attributes, and verifying the expected results. Performance: Performance testing is not needed. Locking & Unlocking Functions:  Basic Functionality: Basic functionality coverage will be accomplished by locking / unlocking a global / local memory region and verifying that the function call returned a valid pointer the first byte of the object's memory block. Boundary Conditions: No boundary tests will be needed. Error Conditions: This will be tested by passing invalid handles or invalid parameters, then checking the error return for expected failure handling. Localization: Localization does not apply. Security: Security does not apply. Performance: These local and global locking API s provide slower memory management with fewer features, therefore, performance will not be tested. Manual tests No manual tests. Configuration tests Standard XBox configuration. Code reviews Unknown. Debug walkthrough  I386kd debugging a remote machine running the XBox OS. Security See the Memory Manager test plan for security details. Performance testing Performance testing will be accomplished using IceCAP, as detailed in the Memory Manager test plan. Catastrophic failure testing Failures are raised mostly as exceptions, which are handled through the test cases and logged to the XBox test harness. Interfaces with other components Interfaces are out of the scope of this document. See the Memory Manager test plan. Localization impact No localization testing will be necessary. Test variations Test case list taken from MMTestCases.xls Test to verify you can reserve virtual memory then free it. Test to verify you can reserve, commit, and free virtual memory. Test to verify you can touch allocated virtual memory. Test to verify you can reserve, commit, and free virtual memory using various protection flags. Test to verify you can reserve / commit the minimum page size of memory (4096 bytes). Test to verify you can reserve / commit all available memory. Test to verify accessing read-only memory raises and exception. Test to verify accessing protected memory raises and exception. Test to verify accessing EXECUTE_READ memory raises and exception. Test to verify accessing PAGE_GUARD memory raises and exception. Test to verify accessing freed memory raises an exception. Test to verify allocating memory in a protected region fails. Test to verify VirutalProtect will change memory protection. Test to verify GetProcessHeap() returns a vaild handle to the default heap. Test functionality of Global memory APIs. Test functionality of Local memory APIs. Test functionality of Heap memory APIs.        Test complete criteria All the above test cases must be completed. Other test cases will be added as the need arises. Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? All test cases. Exceptions will be decided by management. Which failures can we live with on this feature? None. Failure = death. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"?

In a debug build: RIP("XFunction1() invalid pParam1"); will output "XBOX RIP: XFunction1() invalid pParam1\n" to the debugger console and then break into the debugger. The debug binaries will need to link to ntoskrnl.lib for DbgPrint() and RtlAssert(). We can make enhancements as we go.  We may add debug output macros with some sort of standardized output levels in the future. Update xapi's savegame APIs to use the RIP() macro instead of always doing runtime parameter validation.  These functions no longer return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.  It is now strongly recommended that you write your new test/game code against a debug build, otherwise you won't know when you aren't using the APIs properly. Tip from Jason Gould If your application crashes within the first second of its existence, it can be nearly impossible to copy a new version of the .xbe over before it crashes. Since the default title should live on the y: drive, the only way to copy over a new version of the .xbe is using xbcp, which only works if the current app is running properly. The following code will allow crashed code to go, so you can get a new .xbe copied over, without having to reboot. Type the following into the debugger: e eip e9; ed eip+1 fffffffb; g This is equivalent to the masm code: @@: jmp @B which is an infinite loop. Since xbcp works during interrupts, this will allow you to copy your app over to the xbox.  Unfortunately, this does not work if the crash is in the kernel. Profiling with /Gh The /Gh compiler flag will insert a call to _penter() as the first instruction of every function. This can be used to generate profile data such as API hit counts and timing information. How to Profile a Chunk of Code Compile the module you are interested in profiling with the /Gh flag (set  USER_C_FLAGS=/Gh  in the sources for the module or in the environment). Place a call to  void __stdcall penterDumpStats(void)  at the end of your test application. Link ghprof.lib (test\tools\GhProf) to your application. penterDumpStats() will write the profile data to t:\GhProf.log (c:\tdata\xxxxxxxx\GhProf.log) Use GhProfile.exe to generate a user-friendly report using GhProf.log and the map file from the test application. Using With the Test Harness Compile the module you are interested in profiling with the /Gh flag (set  USER_C_FLAGS=/Gh  in the sources for the module or in the environment). Relink the test harness. penterDumpStats() is called automatically when the launcher exits   so if you run your test through the telnet client, you don t have to call this API. Otherwise call it when your test exits. Warnings When Using /Gh GhProf.lib modifies the stack at where the return address should be in relation to the base pointer. This means that FPO (Frame-Pointer Omission) must NOT be enabled. This also means that stack corruption is likely in functions that don t follow standard frame usage. The following APIs will not be profiled: QueryPerformanceCounter GetCurrentThreadId DebugPrint ExAllocatePool ExFreePool Or any call from a high IRQ priority Note that some operating system APIs do not lend well to this type of instrumentation and may cause corruption or crashes. The Report The generated log file (GhProf.log) contains the following information: address: The API address hit count: how many times the API was called avg time: The time in QueryPerformanceCounter ticks (1193182 ticks in 1 sec on xbox). max time: The maximum amount of time the api took to execute min time: the minimum amount of time the api took to execute Gh time: the average time the profiler took to execute on top of the API (the overhead time) child time: the average time spent in APIs called by the current function (including profiler overhead time). Note that this only includes called APIs that are also instrumented via /Gh. Because there are no symbols on the xbox itself, you will have to correlate the address of the API to the symbol name via the MAP file generated by the linker. GhProfiler.exe simply uses the address to look up the symbol name and merges that with GhProf.log. Double Fault Trap As you might know, under Xbox, thread stack size is fixed and couldn't be expanded dynamically like NT. We don't have guard page at the end of stack to catch page fault and expand stack (although guard page mechanism is available under Xbox). Also, we don't separate kernel stack in any way, even while the kernel processes page fault, general protection fault, etc. However double fault and NMI interrupt has its own stack from task gate mechanism. This means that, if your stack is too small and you overflow it, it will generate exception and kernel's trap handler will catch it, using the same stack of current thread and because the stack pointer is already overflowed, it will generate fault again in trap handler, which is double fault and the trap handler number 8 (KiTrap08) will catch it. So if you see double fault, it will be difficult to get the right stack trace because the stack is invalid. The following technique is almost 100% accurate, except memory is totally screwed up ;-) The following stack trace is an example of double fault. This one is from Ravisent's DVD playback which is very large stack space. *** Fatal System Error: 0x0000007f                        (0x00000008,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000) i386kd: A fatal system error has occurred. i386kd: Debugger entered on first try; Bugcheck callbacks have not been invoked. i386kd: A fatal system error has occurred. xboxkrnl!RtlpBreakWithStatusInstruction: 80119810 cc               int     3 i386kd: Reading initial command: 'r;kb;dd nt!KiBugCheckData l 5' eax=00000003 ebx=0000007f ecx=d0072b5c edx=00000000 esi=00000000 edi=00000008 eip=80119810 esp=8012edcc ebp=8012edf8 iopl=0         nv up di pl zr na po nc cs=0008  ss=0010  ds=0010  es=0010  fs=0020  gs=0000             efl=00000046 xboxkrnl!RtlpBreakWithStatusInstruction: 80119810 cc               int     3 ChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child 8012edc8 8010fa36 00000003 00000008 00000000 xboxkrnl!RtlpBreakWithStatusInstruction 8012edf8 8010fb3d 00000003 8b1320e8 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiBugCheckDebugBreak+0x31 8012ee10 8012b00b 0000007f 00000008 00000000 xboxkrnl!KeBugCheckEx+0xca 8012ee10 8012afb8 0000007f 00000008 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08+0x53 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 00000000 8012afb8 00000000 00000000 00000000 xboxkrnl!KiTrap08 From the stack, you will see KiTrap08 repeated over and over.

The tip described here shows you how to locate data in static TLS array. Let say we are trying to locate thread's last error value for current thread. Because thread's last error value now moved to static TLS and the way static TLS works is that the linker sorts and merges all data that have __declspec(thread) attribute into one particular section and there is a special section for IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY (see PE format for this special section). First thing you need to do is to dump the TLS directory, which is located at _tls_used kd> dd default!_tls_used l4 <-- *** dump IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY 0040079c  0040fde0 0040fe6c 0040ebc0 0040fec0 The format of TLS directory is typedef struct _IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY {     DWORD   StartAddressOfRawData;     DWORD   EndAddressOfRawData;     DWORD   AddressOfIndex;             // PDWORD     DWORD   AddressOfCallBacks;         // PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK *     DWORD   SizeOfZeroFill;     DWORD   Characteristics; } IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY; Then locate the per-thread TLS data which is located in thread information block offset 4 (fs:[4]) for Xbox (kernel set this up for you when you call CreateThread) kd> dd fs:4 l1 0020:00000004  d006ddf0 Now we want to find last error code which is XapiLastErrorCode variable. Because the linker sorts and merges all __declspec(thread) data, we have to locate the offset of XapiLastErrorCode in TLS array. By using command ln to list symbol starting from StartAddressOfRawData to EndAddressOfRawData you should be able to find the offset of XapiLastErrorCode. kd> dd default!_tls_used l4 0040079c  0040fde0 0040fe6c 0040ebc0 0040fec0 kd> ln 0040fde0 (0040fde0)   default!_tls_start   |  (0040fde8)   default!XapiTlsSlots kd> ln 0040fde8 (0040fde8)   default!XapiTlsSlots   |  (0040fe68)   default!XapiLastErrorCode kd> ln 0040fe68 (0040fe68)   default!XapiLastErrorCode   |  (0040fe6c)   default!_tls_end kd> ? 0040fe68-0040fde0 Evaluate expression: 136 = 00000088 <-- *** offset of XapiLastErrorCode in TLS array is 0x88 From the above, the offset of XapiLastErrorCode is 0x88, now we have to index this offset into TLS array.

Extensive failure testing because this is a removable media. Spec reviews You should also read:  HYPERLINK "http://xbox/specs/pm/coreos/storage.doc"  http://xbox/specs/pm/coreos/storage.doc Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? Tools needed Performance ll need to measure performance of these storage mediums. The test plan for each medium will cover this in more detail, but in general, the important things to know will be: Data rate Latency CPU / Memory utilization Code coverage We are talking with MSR about getting ICECap modified for us to use for Code Coverage analysis.  All code will get this type of analysis. Static analysis All code will be statically analyzed with PC-Lint, Typo.pl, and PreFix.  Leak testing All code relating to storage will be checked for this. It will be done through a combination of running the tests / measuring / repeat. Look at leaks.doc (checked into   HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) for notes on the how s and why s of leak checking. Corruption testing This will be done with the Driver Verifier (  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) as well as extensive manual tests. Hardware needed What do you need immediately? USB Simulator What will you need further on down the road? I will eventually need the actual memory unit hardware on the Duke controllers (and memory cards) for testing. Various memory card sizes 8, 16, 32, 64,  What lab requirements do you have? None expected Test methods Test code What needs to be written? Subset of the Win32 File IO APIs Tests specific to MU APIs What can be borrowed / adapted? File IO tests What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? Can your code go into a stress test? Manual tests Manual tests include: Unplug controller while accessing (read/write) the card Remove MU while accessing Using corrupted/damaged cards Replace card with a different one (unformatted, empty, full) while accessing Verification of these tests involve making sure the media is as robust as other console memory cards in similar tests and making sure the XBox remains in a stable state while these tests occur. Configuration tests The following configurations need to be addressed: Different sized memory cards (which includes different FAT formats) Cards that are placed in different controllers (e.g. card is in controller 2, but not controller 1) Different sized cards in different slots on the same controller NOTE: It is unclear at this point whether or not we will be able to test larger than 8 meg XCards in the actual hardware (media may not be available)   some of this testing may be restricted to the current PC USB devices (FlashGate). Code reviews How often? For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship. Which Dev / PM will attend? If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security What impact on security does this feature have? Performance testing We need to address read/write performance degradation while the USB port is saturated with isochronous and interrupt transfers because the USB specification does not guarantee bandwidth to bulk transfers. If there is no other traffic, then MU data should be able to go at the max bandwidth.  Catastrophic failure testing Look at the Manual tests for further information on failure tests. Also the hardware testers will perform additional catastrophic tests on the device. Interfaces with other components All test variations should be run while other USB devices are operating. Localization impact All of the file IO tests need to be done using any localized character sets available. Test variations Accessibility through storage related APIs. Read and write data using the provided API tests. Read and write data using higher-level game storage APIs if any. Read and write data by going through driver interfaces. Write disk until full. Attempt to read and write on a damaged disk. Run all API tests in multithreaded mode. Run all API tests in stress mode. Due to the high probability that disks will fail, detecting disk failures and responding appropriately must be thoroughly tested. Run tests with clean disk. Run tests with damaged disk (hardware). Run tests with damaged disk (corrupted data / FAT table). Hot and cold booting Insert new cards while box is on, or before power up Remove cards while box is on, or before power up Plug in a new controller with a card already inserted while box is on, or before power up Unplug a controller with a card inserted while box is on, or before power up Different sized cards  make sure everything works as expected with larger cards. Hardware errors (simulate errors at the different levels) and verify they get propagated up correctly MU device USB errors FAT errors Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for this component to be declared  test complete Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? At first guess, all mainline cases, all failure cases, and most edge cases, the only exceptions agreed upon by a War Team or similar group. Which failures can we live with on this feature? Not many, these are core features. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When they all pass with exceptions as noted above. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential

The tools we will need to perform UI testing are minimal.  We will need to simulate some out of space scenarios, etc, which will require either some software to be developed that will quickly generate this scenario, or an easy way to fill up a Memory Area without the need for software.  Hardware tools are covered below.  Here are some software tools we will need: An Xbox Title that will allow us to change specific settings on the XBox, to see how the XDash will react to this.  Such settings could include Date and Time, Config Sector Information, or data that is stored on the Hard Disc or a Memory Unit. We will need a checked version of the shell to test performance, code coverage, static analysis, and leak testing. Hardware needed At least 1 Xbox. Controllers, up to 4 per Xbox. TVs that are capable of doing 4:3Normal, 4:3Letterbox, 16:9, HDTV, in NTSC and PAL formats. All supported XBox A/V packs. Movie DVD s of various ratings for the different countries.  (update this list) Test methods Test code The test cases, steps, and variations will be stored in TACTICS, which will allow us to easily assign test cases to a specific tester, review results, and update information as needed.  See   HYPERLINK "http://xdk"  http://xdk  for more information on our TACTICS database. Manual tests Scenarios These tests are to ensure that test scenarios, that are not specific to any one Settings Area menu or screen, function as expected. Types of tests that will be performed are: User is prompted to set the Clock upon initial boot of the Xbox for the following variations: Empty CD Tray Audio CD in Tray Xbox Game DVD in Tray DVD Movie in Tray Invalid Media in Tray Collection These tests are to ensure that the  Collection , or Main Menu of the Settings Area functions as expected.

If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM will attend. Debug walkthrough Debugger must be hooked up to the text machine during testing.  If the test engineer does not know how to debug, s/he will need to notify our SDE/Ts or our development owner to debug. Security Security testing specifically on the shell will be minimal.  Overall security testing will be covered in the Security test plan. Performance testing Performance testing will be done on the following: Shell responsiveness.  (If a user selects a new  language , it should respond immediately with a change) Settings Area menu navigation Catastrophic failure testing Verify that when catastrophic failure happens (power cord pulled, box dropped on the floor, lightening strike, as long as the hardware is still operable, upon reboot, the Default Title is still functional.  If data is lost or the hard disk becomes corrupted, verify that the Default Title can be recovered from the recovery disc. Interfaces with other components Many of the settings that are stored on the XDisk need to be available to game titles.  This information will be made available through a standard set of XBox APIs that are defined elsewhere. Localization impact All test cases will be executed on every language we support to verify everything is localized correctly and there is no clipping.  When text can be entered, always use extended characters and Japanese characters.  Usage testing will cover English alphabets. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for the Default Title to be declared  test complete Release criteria All tests must pass at 100%.  The only exceptions will be bugs that the War Team declares as postponed, won t fix, or by design. PAGE   PAGE   Microsoft Confidential rnrncrWrQ gdx0H gdx0H gdx0H

Accessibility through direct calls to the driver to make sure the driver interface is correct. Behavior of specific namespaces / regions as games are installed, saved, etc Integrity of system data areas must be protected and any intrusion detected. Due to the high probability that disks will fail, detecting disk failures and responding appropriately must be thoroughly tested. Spec reviews Where is the spec:  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\xdisk.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\xdisk.doc You should also read:  HYPERLINK "\\\\xbox\\specs\\pm\\CoreOS\\namespace.doc"  \\xbox\specs\pm\CoreOS\namespace.doc  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs\\storageoverviewtesting.doc"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs\storageoverviewtesting.doc Is the spec sufficient to design, document, and test this feature? As of 4/24 it looks OK, although a bit general, and probably subject to change. Tools needed Perf  ll need to measure performance of these storage mediums. The test plan for each medium will cover this in more detail, but in general, the important things to know will be: Data rate Latency CPU / Memory utilization Code coverage We are talking with MSR about getting ICECap modified for us to use for Code Coverage analysis.  All code will get this type of analysis. Static analysis All code will be statically analyzed with PC-Lint, Typo.pl, and PreFix.  Leak testing All code relating to storage will be checked for this. It will be done through a combination of running the tests / measuring / repeat. Look at leaks.doc (checked into   HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs ) for notes on the how s and why s of leak checking. Corruption testing This will be done with the Driver Verifier (  HYPERLINK "\\\\CPITGCFS01\\xboxro\\src\\test\\docs"  \\CPITGCFS01\xboxro\src\test\docs Plans from NT to look at:  HYPERLINK "\\\\johndalyx\\nt\\base\\testsrc\\ntdrvtst\\storage\\procedures\\IDE\\ideadp.doc.doc"  \\johndalyx\nt\base\testsrc\ntdrvtst\storage\procedures\IDE\ideadp.doc.doc  HYPERLINK "\\\\johndalyx\\nt\\base\\testsrc\\ntdrvtst\\storage\\procedures\\IDE\\idecd.doc"  \\johndalyx\nt\base\testsrc\ntdrvtst\storage\procedures\IDE\idecd.doc  HYPERLINK "\\\\johndalyx\\nt\\base\\testsrc\\ntdrvtst\\storage\\procedures\\IDE\\idehd.doc"  \\johndalyx\nt\base\testsrc\ntdrvtst\storage\procedures\IDE\idehd.doc Hardware needed What do you need immediately? We have SDK boxes we can use, later we ll have other types of X-Box dev boxes. We ll also need a variety of other IDE drives that are compatible with our controller so we can see what happens when we increase the drive size. What will you need further on down the road? Larger drives. What lab requirements do you have? None besides what we ll have by default. Test methods Test code What needs to be written? API tests for all the storage API  Josh Poley is responsible for those. <TODO   provide a link for plans for those tests> Test code that behaves like a typical game and used the storage APIs would also be a good thing to have. What can be borrowed / adapted?  HYPERLINK "\\\\johndalyx\\nt\\base\\testsrc\\storage\\sdstress\\"  \\johndalyx\nt\base\testsrc\storage\sdstress\  - sdstress.exe  HYPERLINK "\\\\johndalyx\\nt\\base\\testsrc\\basetool\\storage\\idelog\\"  \\johndalyx\nt\base\testsrc\basetool\storage\idelog\  - idelog.exe What support code do we need, and who is responsible for providing it? Probably none. Can your code go into a stress test? What other input / output is needed? How do you generate test data? Test data for testing these should be generated in a repeatable way so reproducing problems is easy to do. Also pay attention to things like alternating pit patterns on the disk images so 1 bit errors can be detected. Manual tests Assuming that we are testing using functionality in the XBox Dashboard, we should try to do many of the same variations manually that we are doing with software, such as filling the disk, accessing inappropriate stores, etc. We also need to make sure that the UI responds correctly to certain disk conditions, such as disk full, disk mangled, etc. As soon as we have the XBox Dashboard we can elaborate on this and add it to the XBox Dashboard test plan. Configuration tests There are several things that can be considered configuration issues, which must be taken into account in test cases: Different sizes of hard drive need to be used as we plan on having the size increase over the lifespan of the product. The disk being in different states of capacity utilization at power-on time. Code reviews How often? For changed code, after a check-in, and on all code at least 1 time before we ship. Which Dev / PM will attend? If one is scheduled, the developer, the tester, the test lead, and the PM. I do not consider these mandatory for parts of the system where we are using largely unchanged NT code, they are much more important for new code (in my opinion).  What else? The exception to this is the Namespace code, please review that code heavily, as it is new and will have some bugs. The tester for this area, however, should review the code on their own and make sure they understand it. Debug walkthrough  This would be a very good thing for the XDisk code Watch all the tested code in the debugger. Are getting the coverage you think you are? It will help you learn how things work and write better tests. Security The basic security risks surrounding the XDisk are: Can it be removed and read by a PC? We need to check this, we ll be changing the format a bit to make this difficult. Can processes (games) read and write unauthorized parts of the disk? We need to check this. Performance testing Tests designed to mimic real-world scenarios may be more useful for this than API tests. There are several perf issues that are interesting, here is a list: Raw throughput to the disk going directly through the driver. CPU and memory utilization should also be measured. Throughput to the disk going through the storage API s. CPU and memory utilization should be measured, they can be compared with going direct and we can see what the overhead is. Load time for the default title and for games would be good to measure. Exploring the long and short term effects of disk fragmentation would be a good idea. Catastrophic failure testing If the disk is broken, the XBox is broken. We need to check all the failure modes we can and make sure the OS responds correctly. We need to get a list of drive controller failure modes for the controller we are using and try all of them, plus test whatever software we ll be using to detect failures, and we ll need to extensively test any recovery tools, should these be created.. Interfaces with other components Besides interaction with titles and system software, the XDisk will be managed by the XBox Dashboard. This will need extensive testing, XBox Dashboard testing will be covered in another test plan. Localization impact All of the file IO tests need to be done using any localized character sets available. Test variations Accessibility through storage related APIs. Read and write data using the provided API tests. Read and write data using higher-level game storage APIs if any. Read and write making sure that namespaces work correctly, make sure to check boundary conditions such as funky paths, etc. Read and write data by going through driver interfaces. Write disk until full. Attempt to read and write on a damaged disk (should not boot Read and write until the various regions (Cache, Title Data, User Data) are full and make sure the right thing happens (there may be some interaction with the shell With a full disk, read and write until the various regions (Cache, Title Data, User Data) are full and make sure the right thing happens (there may be some interaction with the shell Run all API tests in multithreaded mode. Run all API tests in stress mode. Read and write until the various regions (Cache, Title Data, User Data) are full, delete some things from 1 region, and see if other regions can now expand (there may be some interaction with the shell Behavior of specific namespaces / regions as games are installed, saved, etc Boot with 1 N games installed. Install N games and make sure Cache / Title Data namespaces behave as they are consumed. Make sure that namespace functionality actually works. Boot with filled disk and make sure cache clears and minimum guaranteed space is available. There must be 350MB free before a title is launched. Must use cases where the code can be reclaimed from cache space, and where the user in the shell must reclaim space. This will require filling different regions and booting in these states with a title. Integrity of System Data / The XBox Dashboard Code areas must be protected and any intrusion detected. Change things in the System / Dashboard area and see if it is detected. Corrupt things in the System / Dashboard area and see if it is detected. Attempt writes to the System / Dashboard area and sees they are detected. Due to the high probability that disks will fail, detecting disk failures and responding appropriately must be thoroughly tested. Boot with clean disk (everything installed as if from factory). Boot with damaged disk (everything installed as if from factory except some files missing). Boot with damaged disk (everything installed as if from factory except some files corrupted). Boot with damaged disk (everything installed as if from factory except some files not signed). Corrupt each area (Cache, Title Data, User Data, System Data / The XBox Dashboard Code) individually and make sure the right thing happens. Boot with no disk connected. Boot with each type of HD controller error possible and make sure the software does the correct thing, this is a short list and should be testable.  Do we get a useful diagnostic message? Recoverability   there is no spec for this yet, when there is one make sure to try all of the above on a recovered disk. Different sized disks   make sure everything works as expected with larger disks   future XBoxes will have larger disks. Test complete criteria All of the above scenarios must be covered for this component to be declared  test complete Release criteria Which of these tests need to pass to ship? At first guess, all mainline cases, all failure cases, and most edge cases, the only exceptions agreed upon by a War Team or similar group. Which failures can we live with on this feature? Not many, these are core features. How do we know when your tests say, "this feature is ready to ship"? When they all pass with exceptions as noted above.

For what releases? What level of parameter checking will be present?  Will all error conditions cause an ASSERT? Differences Between Xbox and Desktop Implementations Supported API The DirectVoice API s are made up of 3 interfaces   IDirectPlayVoiceClient, IDirectPlayVoiceServer and IDirectPlayVoiceTest.  Configuration of the XHawk device (voice input device for Xbox) will be taken care of by means outside of DirectVoice, so only the IDirectPlayVoiceClient and IDirectPlayVoiceServer interfaces will be present on Xbox. Voice Client API s (IDirectPlayVoiceClient) Voice Server API s (IDirectPlayVoiceServer) Existing DirectPlay Test Resources Test Plans Voice Test Plan   useful to Xbox testing, many tests carry-over  HYPERLINK "\\\\directx1\\public\\VSS\\Dplay\\Docs\\Test Dev Plans/DPlay8Voice Test Plan.doc"  \\directx1\public\VSS\Dplay\Docs\Test Dev Plans/DPlay8Voice Test Plan.doc Test Tools Network State Test Tools Stress Test Tools DPVLoopy   DirectVoice loopback session test app  HYPERLINK "\\\\tell\\nt\\multimedia\\testsrc\\dplay\\dpvloopy"  \\tell\nt\multimedia\testsrc\dplay\dpvloopy Release Criteria Alpha 2 (Early December) Test Methodology Overview The initial goal of DirectPlay for Xbox testing will be to leverage tests from the DirectPlay team by porting them to the Xbox environment as quickly as possible.  Because the DirectPlay team s TestNet harness has dependencies on many things that are not present on Xbox (i.e. DLLs, callback model, local file system, registry, etc.) this will not be directly ported to Xbox at this time.  Instead, Netsync for Xbox will be used as a synchronizing agent for DirectPlay tests.  Many of these tests will be ported from TestNet test modules.   Several DirectPlay stress tests will also be ported.  Once porting is done and these tests can be run, any holes will be filled by creating Xbox-specific tests. BVT/API Testing Goal: Cover every DirectVoice APIs that will be supported by Xbox and call it with A case for each category of success (e.g. asynchronous, secure, etc.) A case for each error code indicating failure (debug only, retail will not have parameter checking) IDirectPlayVoiceClient IdirectPlayVoiceServer Stress Testing Goal:  To create multithreaded applications that maximize network throughput by sending and receiving voice data from multiple targets and sources.  Also, to call as many DirectPlay API s in as many states and with as many parameters as possible over time. Network State Testing Goal:  To create special test cases for issues that are dependent on network state (e.g. voice host migration due to timeout).  Many of these test cases may be ported from the DirectPlay team s TestNet modules.

Updated to reflect which tests are ready and which tests are still being developed and ported Tristan Jackson (tristanj) Overview Open Issues Will Xbox support server and client API s?  For what releases? What level of parameter checking will be present?  Will all error conditions cause an ASSERT? Differences Between Xbox and Desktop Implementations Supported API Currently, the DirectPlay8 interfaces are only documented in Beta versions of the DirectX 8 SDK.  From looking at the information there, I ve come up with the following basic list of API s.  The DirectVoice API s are made up of 3 interfaces   IdirectPlayVoiceClient, IdirectPlayVoiceServer and IDirectPlayVoiceTest.  These interfaces have been left out of this test plan pending an Xbox spec.

This harness allows for complex network events, such as hosts leaving and being disconnected from a session, to be scripted.  Much of the early effort for testing DirectPlay for Xbox has come via porting the TestNet harness and running the existing tests on the Xbox client.  Now that it has been decided that the Xbox version of DPlay will uses a polling model and Xbox will not support DLLs, it will be difficult to port the TestNet harness in its entirety.  Instead, the only modules that make up the DPlay8 TestNet tests will be ported (as much as is directly applicable to Xbox) and Netsync will be used as the synchronizing agent for tests, which require coordination between multiple machines.  If, at a later date, there is enough time available to look at porting the entire TestNet harness to Xbox, then it will be considered. To install the DirectPlay team s TestNet tools, run this batch file.

The quality bar is set below that of a beta product but should still be basically usable by developers.  Memory leaks and stress scenarios aren t as important as the basic ability to be able to set up communication sessions and exchange data.  Peer interfaces will be targeted above client and server cases.  For this release, the DirectX 8 SDK will be taken as the spec reference.  In later releases, when DirectPlay for Xbox changes from a callback model to a polling model, this dependence on the DirectX 8 SDK will be relaxed somewhat. DirectVoice will be tested to the extent that it integrates with DirectPlay.  DanRose will test all audio specific portions of DirectVoice. All IDirectPlay8Peer, IDirectPlay8Address and IDirectPlay8AddressIP functions must pass BVT and API level tests.  For Alpha 2, the majority of the API level testing will be done on a local machine without communicating via the network.  These tests are listed under the BVT/API Testing section. Must pass all network state tests such as group management, send/receive, connection/disconnection and enumeration.  Some host migration and complex disconnection/connection-drop cases may be written, but these aren t a priority for this release.  Tests fitting in this category are listed under the Network State Testing section. Must pass thirty minutes of basic send/receive/group-management stress on the IDirectPlay8Peer interfaces in a session with 4 players.  This stress test will either be a ported version of DNSalvo, or a simple Xbox app that does something similar.  More information on these tests will be added to the Stress Testing section. Unless mentioned otherwise in the Xbox DirectPlay spec, all DirectPlay functions in the DirectX 8 SDK must at least have basic functionality.  Bugs will be RAIDed against anything that doesn t match these two sources.  These bugs must be resolved either by updating the Xbox DirectPlay spec, or fixing the function that has the problem. Must be able to setup and run a DirectVoice session over DirectPlay for 5 minutes.  More details on this Test Methodology Overview The initial goal of DirectPlay for Xbox testing will be to leverage tests from the DirectPlay team by porting them to the Xbox environment as quickly as possible.  Because the DirectPlay team s TestNet harness has dependencies on many things that are not present on Xbox (i.e. DLLs, callback model, local file system, registry, etc.) this will not be directly ported to Xbox at this time.  Instead, Netsync for Xbox will be used as a synchronizing agent for DirectPlay tests.  Many of these tests will be ported from TestNet test modules.   Several DirectPlay stress tests will also be ported.  Once porting is done and these tests can be run, any holes will be filled with Xbox-specific tests. BVT/API Testing Goal: Cover every DirectPlay8 API that will be supported by Xbox and call it with A case for each category of success (e.g. asynchronous, secure, etc.) A case for each error code indicating failure (debug only, retail will not have parameter checking) Note: Items highlighted in red are not yet implemented IDirectPlay8PeerTests DirectPlay8Create DirectPlay8PeerCreate with both

that maximize network throughput and call as many DirectPlay API s in as many states and with as many parameters as possible over time. Note: Items highlighted in red are not yet implemented Network State Testing Goal:  Create special test cases for issues that are dependent on network state (e.g. host migration due to timeout).  These test cases come from the DirectPlay Core Test Plan and will be dependent on the TestNet test harness being ported to Xbox.

Tristan Jackson (tristanj) 5/7/2001 Added client test cases Tristan Jackson (tristanj) 5/21/2001 Updated with test plan review feedback Tristan Jackson (tristanj) 5/29/2001 Updated with latest test coverage for client APIs Tristan Jackson (tristanj) Overview This document details the test plan for both the client and server side of the Xbox Online matchmaking service. The client side of the matchmaking service consists of the following components: A number of matchmaking-specific APIs.  These APIs are defined in the Xbox matchmaking spec (Xbox Matchmaking.doc) and used to perform basic functions such as advertising a session to the matchmaking system and starting a search for available sessions.  These APIs will create asynchronous task handles that can be pumped by a title s main thread to provide cycles to complete a request.  These task handles will rely on asynchronous XRL subtasks to complete the uploading and downloading of information from the online services.  The XRL APIs are defined in  A notification queue interface.  Xbox clients will receive asynchronous matchmaking results via this interface.  It is not an objective of this test plan to directly test this subsystem. Several Xbox online security APIs and a security-enabled network stack.  These APIs will be used to establish authenticated communications with the matchmaking server.  Additionally, when a new session is going be advertised, the Xbox client will use these APIs to generate a session key and encrypt it for transmission to the matchmaking server. The server side of the matchmaking service consists of the following components: An ISAPI extension DLL sitting on the Xbox Online front-end servers.  This extension receives HTTP requests (tunneled through ESPUDP and using HTTP 1.0 for POSTs and HTTP 1.1 for GETs, if there are any) from Xbox clients requesting matchmaking services and then routes those requests to the matchmaking database. A matchmaking database that stores information on sessions that are currently being advertised via the Xbox Online service.  The database will have records inserted into it and have queries run on it from the ISAPI extension DLLs.  The database will return results of queries to the Xbox client via the notification queue. The notification queue is used to notify Xbox clients when data is waiting for them.  Several other services rely on the notification queue system including buddies and invitations.  In the case of matchmaking, search results reach the Xbox client via the notification queue.  It is not an objective of this test plan to test the delivery of matchmaking information from the notification queue to Xbox clients.  However, many end-to-end tests will indirectly rely on the notification queue. Open Issues Integration work with Xbox Online security tunneling, the notification queue and the online presence system. How will sessions be updated to reflect the players currently in the session? When will a set of template stored procedures be developed? A special stored procedure for retrieving a particular session ID needs to be developed.  This will be needed by the XMatchGetSession API. How does the matchmaking server tell the client when it needs to host a session instead of searching for one?  Possibly through a 400 status code returned from the matchmaking service, but this hasn t been defined yet. How will game session keys be integrated into the matchmaking process?  Possibly the server will generate the key and return it (encrypted) to each game client, but this hasn t been defined yet. How frequently will an Xbox client be allowed to make search requests? How long do the client search APIs wait for results before timing out? Milestones This section includes a basic outline of what features will come online in each milestone. Basic functionality All search results are returned synchronously First client API s are implemented No authentication required, no provisions for key exchange First integration work with other online services Enforce the use of only title ID s that are present in the xmatch_titles table when creating sessions Begin using notification queue to return asynchronous results Client API will start allowing user-specific attributes to be set Authentication integration begins Key exchange integrated into matchmaking system Blacklisting integration (if anything is necessary) Release Criteria Client-side Components All client and protocol tests must pass 100 percent of functional test cases.  Client stress must be able to run without crashes and memory or resource leaks for 24 hours. Before the final release, all Client API tests must run on an Xbox in every supported connectivity environment (e.g. no NAT, string source-filtering NAT, etc.) M0 notes Components won t be using notification queue for asynchronous results delivery.   Server-side Components Server database and front end server must be able to handle 10-times the maximum expected first year stress for 72 hours.  System-wide stress must execute for 72 hours. M0 notes Components won t be using notification queue for asynchronous results delivery.   Client-side Tests API Testing The goal of these tests is to cover every XMatch API that will be supported by Xbox and call it with A case for each category of success (e.g. creating a new session, updating an old session, etc.) A case for each error code indicating failure (debug only, retail will not have parameter checking) These test cases will be implemented inside a client module (XMATCHTEST.LIB) for the Xbox test harness.

Then call XOnlineTaskContinue to download those additional results Stress Testing These tests will consist of multithreaded applications that create multiple asynchronous matchmaking requests.  Various models (e.g. waiting on async event and timed polling at various intervals) for calling the asynchronous work-pump will be used simultaneously by different threads. These test cases will be implemented inside a client module (XMATCHSTRESS.LIB) for the Xbox test harness. System-wide Tests These tests will focus on simulating Xbox client requests via the ISAPI front-end servers servers. Verification Testing These tests are meant to verify basic properties of the systems and protocols used by the matchmaking service. Protocol Verify that session creation, modification and search requests are all sent and responded to using HTTP 1.0. Verify that notification queue retrievals are returned using the appropriate protocol Functional Testing These tests will send requests formatted in the Xmatch protocol to the matchmaking server to simulate client behavior.  They will focus on testing the behavior of the matchmaking protocol itself.  A subset of these tests might be used later by the Xbox Online operations team to verify that the matchmaking service is up and running. These tests cases will be implemented inside a PC executable (MMTEST.EXE).

session with a blob attribute Search such that results contain a session with a user integer attribute Search such that results contain a session with a user string attribute Search such that results contain a session with a user blob attribute Stress Testing There are several internal tools available for generic stressing of web pages.  One of these tools is   HYPERLINK "http://ToolBox/details/details.aspx?ToolID=639"  Web Application Stress .  Many of the server-side stress tests will consist of scripts for use with this tool. Web Application Stress Scripts The following Web Application Stress scripts will be created for stress testing: A session creation script which will loop repeatedly and create thousands of sessions A session search script which will loop repeatedly and send thousands of search requests Session Creation Scripts The session creation scripts will be used to measure the effect on performance of sending up various types of attributes with a request to create a session.  Performance statistics will be taken by calculating the number of creation requests in a one minute period that can be completed in each of the following scenarios: Attribute variation: Each creation request contains no attributes Each creation request contains one integer attribute Each creation request contains one string attribute Each creation request contains one blob attribute Session Search Scripts The session search scripts will be used to measure the effect on performance of 1) the type of attributes sent to the stored procedure, 2) the type of processing in the associated stored procedure and 3) the number of results returned by the stored procedure.  Performance statistics will be taken by calculating both the number of search requests in a one minute period that can be completed and the resource usage characteristics on the matchmaking server in each of the following scenarios: Parameter variation: (one WHERE criteria and no results returned) Each search request contains no parameters Each search request contains one integer parameter Each search request contains one string parameter Each search request contains one blob parameter Processing variation: (no parameters and no results returned) Stored procedure does a SELECT with no WHERE criteria Stored procedure does a SELECT with one integer WHERE criteria Stored procedure does a SELECT with one 20-character string WHERE criteria Stored procedure does a SELECT with one 100-byte blob WHERE criteria Results variation: (no parameters and one WHERE criteria) No results are returned 5 results are returned 10 results are returned Custom Stress Applications Some additional stress applications will need to be developed to measure special performance cases.  Also, once integration work is completed with the notification queue, search performance will be difficult to measure with generic web stress tools.  The following custom stress applications will need to be developed: A session modification test that creates a session and then loops repeatedly while sending modifications to it (MMMODSTRESS.EXE) A session search test that loops repeatedly and sends thousands of search requests while another thread listens for a notification queue tickle and then retrieves results. (MMSEARCHSTRESS.EXE) Session Modification Tests The session modification tests will be used to measure the effect on performance of modifying existing attributes, adding new attributes and modifying public/private available.  Performance statistics will be taken by calculating the number of creation requests in a one minute period that can be completed in each of the following scenarios: Attribute modification: Each modification request modifies one integer attribute Each modification request modifies one 20-character string attribute Each modification request modifies one 100-byte blob attribute Attribute addition: Each modification request adds one integer attribute Each modification request adds one 20-character string attribute Each modification request adds one 100-byte blob attribute Public/private modification: Each modification request changes the public available Each modification request changes the private available Session Search Tests The same tests will be used as listed in Session Search Scripts above, but due to the complexity of dealing with the notification queue, these tests will probably have to be re-written at some point as a custom application rather than as a generic web stress script. Database Access Tests These tests will focus on accessing the database access layer (XStorage) directly.  This will probably be more useful for stressing the database itself. This test will be implemented inside a PC executable (XSTORAGETEST.EXE) that will execute on the ISAPI front-end server or some other machine on the private side of the Xbox Online network.  The test will make direct calls to the matchmaking database to add entries to and remove entries from the database.  The test will be multithreaded with each thread simultaneously making requests to the database to simulate multiple requests coming in from physically different ISAPI front-end servers. Other notes  When integration work is completed with the notification queue, calculating search performance statistics will be more complicated.  A custom application will probably have to be developed for that case.

Create shortcuts to the CD-ROM drive and place then in folders, on the desktop, etc   They will be used through this section of the test. Scenario Expected Results Insert an Audio CD while holding the shift key down. All the shortcuts to the drive update to show that an audio CD is in the drive. Right click on one of the shortcuts. Play should be the default context menu item. Select play from the context menu The CD starts playing at track 1. Close the CD player.  Double click a shortcut. The CD starts playing at track1. Close the CD Player.  Explore the CD There is a file representing each track. (i.e. track01.CDA)  Each file should be 44 bytes. Double click on a track icon. That track starts playing. Create some shortcuts of the track icons.  Play with them. The shortcuts should behave just like the track files. Drag a track icon to the CD Player. That track should begin to play Select multiple tracks.  Select play from the context menu. Each track should play in turn. Eject the CD. The drive shortcuts should eturn to the normal CD-ROM icon Insert a build CD in the drive. The drive shortcuts should change to the windows icon. Autorun Test When a CD is placed in the drive, then it should autorun.  Holding down the shift key while inserting the CD disables autorun for that event.  Additional documentation on Autorun can be found in the DirectX documentation. Scenario Expected Result Insert an audio CD. The CD starts playing Insert a build CD The CD autoruns Insert a CD w/o autorun The CD does not autorun Insert an audio CD/build CD while holding down shift The CD does not autorun CD Mastering Test There are many different CD mastering programs out there.  We need to verify that we can handle media made with the different media mastering software.  It is hard to describe this section of the test.  Trying a wide variety of different options is key to finding bugs that may exist.  With packet written CDs doing renames, moves, deletes, etc is encouraged.   Software to use (PW   denotes packet writing software): CDImage (MS Internal) Easy CD Creator (Adaptec) Direct CD (Adaptec) (PW) Scenario Expected Result Create some CDs with different software. Windows can read them correctly. Create packet written CDs with a CD-R Windows can read them correctly. Create packet written CDs on a CD-RW (with RW media) Windows can read them correctly. DVD Test DVDs use the UDF file system.  Because of the tie between UDF and DVD, there are special DVD functions in the UDF file system that need testing. Scenario Expected Result Put a DVD in the drive You can read the drive and it mounts as UDF. Put a movie DVD in the drive The drive mounts as UDF and the movie begins playing Plug N Play Test CD-ROM devices can be removed and added dynamicly (providing the hardware supports it).  The file system must handle these events.  These tests are for laptop docking stations with a CD-ROM in the dock. Scenario Expected Result Dock the laptop.  Place a CDFS disk in the drive.  After it mounts, then undock. The undock happens without problems. Repeat the above, but with explorer open to the CD. The undock happens without problems. Redock. The undock happens without problems. Undock with a  CD in the drive.  Switch CDs.  Redock. The undock/dock happens without problems. Repeat all of the above with a UDF disk in the drive. As above

December Alpha Release Specification Currently, no XRL specification has been checked in.  The XRL specification passed through a spec review. Features This release will focus on the development of the XRL Blocking APIs. This release is required to ship the following XRL Blocking APIs: XRL_DownloadFile XRL_Upload XRL_DownloadToMemory Test Tools Test Harness   Most API level testing will be developed as modules for the general xbox operating system test harness (developed by the operating system s test team). Test Harness XRL Modules   The modules that will be developed to run within the test harness. XRL Server Simulator   In order to simulate corrupt or invalid data being received from the XRL servers, a lightweight server simulator will be developed to test this area.  This tool will not be designed for stress purposes and may only allow one XRL client to be connected at a time. XRL Content File Generator   A small utility will be developed to automate the process of generating n byte length files for upload or download. Hardware Resources  Xbox Development Kit XRL Server (IIS server running operational center s version of the operating system and applications). Local Area Network Direct Internet Network Human Resources 1 SDET resource   Test plan development, Test outline development, Test case development, execution of test cases. 1 Lab Manager resource   Server setup and configuration. Test Methods Code Review Each piece of code checked in by development will be dev-buddy code reviewed according to the standards put in place by the online development team.  This section describes the level of code review that is done beyond this basic verification. The XRL API interfaces will be initially code reviewed by the SDET resource assigned to testing this area.  The code will always be independently code reviewed by the SDET resource, however, the SDET resource may also end up attending a wider code review session that includes members from the development team. Each XRL code check in (whether it be new code or bug fixes) should be code reviewed by the SDET resource as well to help maintain code stability and to give insight into which areas are affected by per said check in. Manual At this point the XRL API usage is not part of the default title; so manual testing cannot be performed with regards to shipping code.  Samples will exercise the basic XRL APIs and should be successfully run. Functional Functional tests will consist of the typical scenarios including: Valid parameters Invalid parameters (Debug Only) Boundary cases Stress The XRL API will be stressed through serial, parallel, single-threaded, multi-threaded and random stress testing.  Memory tracking will be used to detect memory leaks during stress testing. Security Since XRL content servers are generally defined as standard IIS servers, no IIS security testing will be completed with the exception of validating and testing the IIS server s configuration settings. Performance A set of basic API calls will be timed and recorded for evaluation.  Performance criteria will depend on a subjective analysis of the results by Program Management, Development, and Test.  Test s primary goal is to record these timing so that the team can make a well-informed decision about performance criteria and incorporate those requirements into the release criteria. Failure Failure testing will be accomplished through both physical and software side testing.  General network failures and in progress transfer failures will be tested through such actions as disconnection of the network or shutting down the web server hosting the XRL content.  The XRL Server Simulator Tool will be used to corrupt and invalidate data coming across the wire to the XRL client. Integration Integration testing will focus on the integration between the XRL client and the XRL servers.  Testing will be performed over a LAN.  Testing over a WAN will be performed if time and resources permit. XRL servers will be running the latest operational center s version of Microsoft s IIS services.  Testing against other web server technologies (such as Linux/Apache) will not be supported since the services are a closed network. Localization XRL API should be able to send and receive URLs that have been URL Encoded (example GET /%72%65%61%64%2F%30%30%30%30%30%30%30%30%2E%30%30%31). Verification will be done to ensure that extended characters can be used when specifying local filenames.  Verification will also be done to handle the URL Encoded to ANSI case.

which contains files recorded according to one of the following standards. File System  conforming to the  ISO9660 standard Universal Disk File System versions 1.02,1.50 and 2.00 These filesystems are usually recorded on Compact Disks and DVDs.  The cost effectiveness, convienience and high storage capacity offered by these media make them very useful for  distribution of software, multimedia content, archiving of data and for a variety of other purposes. Component Testing BVT Test Suite Functionality Tests IOTest IO test tests the underlying filesystem by attempting to do IO operations on files in the file system in the following ways Buffered IO with Sequential Access  Read operations are performed on files opened with FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN bit set.

The time zone offset is specified in minutes from coordinated universal time and the value is either  2047, which means that no offset is specified, or in the range (1440 to +1440 minutes.  This allows a range from  24 hours to +24 hours. Time zones West of Coordinated Universal Time have negative offsets. When adjusted for time zone, the files in this directory all have the same date and time of creation.  On systems that support time zones, all files should show the same creation and modification dates and times. On systems that do not support time zones, the times will be offset from the GMT_0.TXT time. The creation and modification times for each file (after adjustment for time zone) is: Year: 1998  Month: 8 Day: 7  Hour: 6 Minute:5  Second: 4 Centisecond: 3  Hundreds of microseconds: 2  Microseconds: 1 Date Stress Description: 21 files shall be recorded with timestamps in each decade beginning with decade starting in the year 1900 and ending with the decade starting in the year 2100.

Path Length Description: A number of directories shall be recorded in such a way that they shall create a directory path that reaches the limit of 1023 bytes. Location: \deeptree Path name: \deeptree\OSTA001\OSTA002\OSTA003\OSTA004\OSTA005\ .\OSTA125\OSTA126\EINDE References: Applicable ECMA spec reference(s):  none (that I could find) Applicable UDF spec references(s):  2 Rules: Implementations must be able to coherently handle directory path lengths that are longer than supported by the OS.  By "coherently handle", it is meant that the implementation not crash, or take any destructive action.   It is not required that directory paths longer than maximum OS supported length be accessible. Large Directory Description: A directory is recorded with 50000 files.  The file names are the ascii numbers from 1 through 50000.  The contents of each file is the name.  For instance the file named "34" is two bytes in length and those two bytes are ascii "3" and "4". Location: \filename\50Kfiles File names: 49999 50000 Rules: All 50000 files should be accessible and correctly readable. Large File Description : Two large file's shall be recorded whose size 2GB-1(xx byte size) and 16GB in total using unallocated and unrecorded space extents xe "extents" Location on disc(s) : /large_file Filenames : /large_file/2GB-1FILE /large_file/16GBFILE Notes : The first logical block of the file shall contain "START " followed by NULL The last logical block of the file shall contain " END" preceded by NULL All blocks in between are unrecorded and unallocated space. Though the file size is 64-bit, other restrictions apply limiting the practical size of the file. So it was decided that we would test a file larger than the 32-bit limit (4GB). References: Applicable ECMA spec reference(s) : 4/14.9.10 Rules: Implementations should be able to read the 16GBFILE file if the operating system supports files larger than 4GB. On operating systems that support files larger than 4GB the file should be completely readable and the data should be verified as written in the notes section. If the operating system does not support files larger than 4GB they should either ignore the file or read it till the maximum size possible under the operating system. 2GB-1 file is created to test implementations that only support a 32-bit maximum file size. The behaviour shall be similar to the 16GB file. Note: The 2GB-1 was created to support systems that are limited to 2GB file sizes.

Note: As mentioned in chapter 1, these test discs contain only correct and valid UDF with the exception of this case. Deliberately adding corrupt data however is the only way to ensure that a CRC failure will occur. Volume descriptor pointer Description:  Split the necessary volume descriptor into 2 pieces so that you have to travel to both. Location on discs: The volume descriptor sequence shall be recorded in the following order Sector 0: The Logical Volume Descriptor. Sector 1: A Volume Descriptor Pointer referring to the allocation starting at the physical sector corresponding to Sector 3 in this specification. Sector 2: A Terminating Descriptor (3:10.9).

Location on disc(s):  /sym_link Filenames: /sym_link/dir - This is a regular directory /sym_link/dir/file - This is a regular file /sym_link/sym_link_to_dir - The symbolic link shall reference "dir" /sym_link/sym_link_to_file - The symbolic link shall reference "file" /sym_link/sym_link_to_sym_link - This is a symbolic link referencing the previous    symbolic link /sym_link/larg_sym_link_to_file - The symbolic link shall reference "file" Notes: /sym_link/sym_link_to_dir shall be a symbolic link to "dir". /sym_link/sym_link_to_file shall be a symbolic link to "file". /sym_link/sym_link_to_sym_link shall be a symbolic link to "sym_link_to_file". /sym_link/larg_sym_link_to_file shall be a symbolic link to "file" but the path name shall be longer than 512 bytes. All symbolic links shall be made with relative path names as absolute path name can change between operating systems and instances. The large symbolic links shall make several hops as following "../sym_link/" for 42 times followed by "file". Rules: Applicable ECMA spec reference(s):  ECMA 167 Part 4:14.6.6 UDF 4:4.2.1.1 All operating system which choose to support symbolic links shall reference the file referenced by the symbolic link and not the symbolic link for any   operations performed on the symbolic link or when requesting attributes of the original file. See test case xxxx for systems that do not support SymLinks UID and GID Description:  There will be several files with different UID and GID. Location on disc(s):  /u-gids Filenames: /u-gids/uid=00000000-gid=00000000 /u-gids/uid=00000FFF-gid=00000FFF /u-gids/uid=30000000-gid=30000000 /u-gids/uid=FFFFFFFF-gid=FFFFFFFF Notes: All files will have the same value for uid and gid as mentioned in the file name. If the operating system supports the concept of user/group id's and does not support the above user/group id's then it should use default user/group id. First three names are added to test operating systems with user/group id's smaller than 32-bit. The last name is added to test the user/group id supporting operating system to work properly with media from a operating system that does not support user/group id's. Standard and Extended File Entries Description: Mix Standard and Extended File Entries in one directory to make sure that UDF 2.0 compliant File Systems handle both structures.  Location on disc: \ExtdFEs File names: Comments Standard File Entry Extended File Entry Directory Standard File Entry 3of5\file_in_3of5 Standard File Entry Directory Extended File Entry 4of5\file_in_4of5 Standard File Entry Standard File Entry Rules: The main directory contains 3 files and 2 directories. Each of the two directories contains a simple file identifying its parent directory. A UDF 2.0 compliant File System shall be able to access all items without errors. File Content Testing File Content All files, unless otherwise specified, shall contain the following unique verifiable data. Each 512-byte block of a file will be structured as follows: struct FileRecord { Uint32 RecordNumber; /* Given 512 byte records, this is the record number (1-n) */ Uint8 LengthOfName; /* Length of the NameOnDisk field */ Uint8 NameOnDisk[]; /* The original file name as recorded on disc */ /* The record shall be padded with 0 to fill out the 512 bytes */ This type of file contents is intended to help a developer when they encounter a problem reading the file data. The actual file size will be dependent upon the purpose of a file and will be specified by the corresponding test associated with the file. File CRC Part of the verification test process will be to verify that an implementation can correctly read the contents of every file on the test disc. This is accomplished by the calculation of a 32-bit CRC on the file content. For each supported operating system (OS) there shall exist an OS specific subdirectory in the root directory of each test disc. The following file shall exist in each OS specific subdirectory. FILECRC.TXT This file shall contain a list of all files located on the test disc, as well as the CRC of each file. The fully qualified file names listed in this file shall be the file names as they appear to the user, after going through the OSTA name translation algorithm for the corresponding OS. The following is an example of what the FILECRC.TXT might contain for the Windows 9X operating system. /README.TXT , 0x7034A7D2 /Dates/DateFile1.txt , 0x0A39CB27 /AllocationDescriptors/Short/TestFile1 , 0x45F30D42 Note:  The filename shall include the pathname for the file. For every file on the test disc an implementation shall calculate the file s 32-bit CRC and compare it against the master CRC in the FILECRC.TXT file. If the CRC does not match, the implementation has failed to read the file successfully. Long File Names Description: Two files shall be recorded with file identifiers whose length shall be exactly 255 bytes in length with 8 bit unicode compression (254 characters). The two filenames shall differ only by the last character of each filename. Two files shall be recorded with file identifiers whose length shall be exactly 255 bytes in length with 16 bit unicode compression (127 characters). The two filenames shall differ only by the last character of each filename. Location on disc(s): \FILENAME\LONG File names: THIS_IS_A_LONG_8BIT_FILE_NAME _XXXXXX .XXXXX_1.DAT THIS_IS_A_LONG_8BIT _FILE_NAME_XXXXXX .XXXXX_2.DAT THIS_IS_A_LONG_16BIT_FILE_NAME _XXXXXX .XXXXX_1.DAT THIS_IS_A_LONG_16BIT _FILE_NAME_XXXXXX .XXXXX_2.DAT <<UNICODE_NON ROMAN_1>> (Use non standard characters (Euro) in both name and extension <<UNICODE_NONROMAN_2>> References: Applicable ECMA 167 references:   4:48.4.4 Applicable UDF 2.0 reference: 2.1.1, 6.7 Rules: The length of a file identifier is stored as a single byte.  This gives a maximum length of 255 bytes for the representation of a file identifier.  In UDF the identifier is stored as compressed unicode and the first byte is reserved for a compression id.  This leaves 254 bytes for the name itself.  If the compression id is 8, each character is stored as a single byte and the name can be 254 bytes long.  If the compression id is 16, each character is stored in two bytes and the name can be 127 characters long. All four files should be accessible and be displayed with different names in accordance with the identifier translation algorithms for the operating system on which the disc is read.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8microsoft Tunnel Testing  Code Notes TitleTunnel Testing  Code Notes benjamin leis Normal.dot Josh Poley Microsoft Word 9.0@\\red-prn-15\CORP0126 USA/REDMOND/REDW-C/FLOOR1/NEAR 1258 Ne00: winspool HP LaserJet 8100 Series PS \\red-prn-15\CORP0126 USA/REDMO Letter \\red-prn-15\CORP0126 USA/REDMO LetterbjbjU Tunnel Testing  Code Notes Benjamin Leis 11/29/95 Tunneling is the  means by  which a file s state is transferred  when a program updates it. Since most programs update files by  replacing the original file with a new one the system must maintain this state in between the disappearance of the original file and the appearance of  the new one.  This disappearance can occur either  by the renaming or deletion of  the file. Likewise, reappearance occurs either from  the renaming or creation of the new file.   In the original  FAT system dirnodes were left untouched after deletion so if no other file  had taken the dirnode  in the directory when the file reappeared it would be given back its original dirnode and state (limited in this case to the filetime stamps) would be preserved.  The tunnel cache implements  this behavior on the FastFat and NTFS  file systems.  The cache stores the primary name and the alternative name that must be restored later, the  directory to which it belongs, and some opaque data Hooks into the filesystem are called upon the appearance or disappearance of names within a directory. At that time the tunnel cache is searched for hits and cleaned of timed out entries.   If the a name reappears  and a hit is found then  the cached data is restored.  File state on these systems includes the filetime stamps and also the alternate short name for long file names.  This behavior must  occur in between a specified time frame which by default is 15 seconds. Also  tunneling is a directory specific operation.   If a file disappears in one directory and reappears in another, no tunneling occurs.  Tunnel testing basically involves Creating files, making them disappear in various ways and then having them reappear and verifying the filenames and creation times are still correct. Note: See the test plan for a more detailed description of tunnelling and what scenarios are being tested Class Hierarchy CExceptThrower   CStore     CState    CfileObj   CFileState CTunneler    CExceptThrower   CSrc CRemoteSrc CLocalSrc Description CExceptThrower This class encapsulates structured exception handling. All other class are considered to be exception-throwers  and thus are descended from it.  Provisions are included for Logging an error, catching an error,  catching an error and rethrowing it, and printing an error.  In addition the constructor s arguments control whether exceptions are used at all or instead if messages are printed and a FALSE status returned.  The exceptions return back info including the class and member function that threw it, the call that caused the problem, the LastError  and any additional parameters specified. CStore  This class implements the abstract interface for a store.  A store is any presistent object that can contain data.  Stores can be created, moved, copied, written to, deleted etc.  This class is coupled to CState since every CStore is meant to contain a CState. This allows easy verification. You ask a store for its state and later on can ask the store to verify itself against an old state. CState  This class implements the abstact interface for a state.  A state holds any state information of a store that is needed for verfication. Ex: In tunnel testing the state contains the file s names, and creation time.  States can only print themselves and verify themselves against another state. Different levels of verification can be specified.  Note: only CStores  can create states. CSrc  This Class implements the abstract interface for source.  A source is a persistent object that can contain a CStore.   Ex:  a directory contains a file.   Sources are created, return  back their name, and are destroyed, CFileObj This encapsulates the interface to a direct file.   CRemoteSrc  A remote source is either a drive or UNC location. Creation in this case only means verifying the source exists and connecting to it if necessary. CLocalSrc  A local source is a directory which is created and deleted. CTunneler The tunneler class acts as a bridge between  the  vocabulary of stores and the  vocabulary of tunnel testing. Instead of moving a file,  you tell a tunneler to make the file disappear. It handles how to do this and saving any state information. Inside the tunneler are several stores, and states.  The tunneler s methods are meant to be called sequentially and a separate tunneler has to be made for each scenario.  The typical use will be a sequence like, Create a store, Clone the store, have the store Disappear, have the store Reappear, and Verify the store s state.  The tunneler also has several member mutexes to corrdinate in multithreaded situations.  Program Structure The  main module tnltest.cxx follows the following control flow.  First the ntlog  is setup. Then, the sanity tests are run. These directly manipulate CFileObj and make sure moving the files around correctly transfers the filetimes. Then the heart of the program tnltest is called with  a list of scenarios several times.  According to the flags for each scenario, tnltest creates a tunneler and invokes the particular scenario. Finally, the multithreaded tunnelling situations are run. These involve an extra  level of functions around tnltest which basically set the static members of ctunneler  (these setup mutexes etc.) so it can coordinate the threads and calls n threads running tnltest.

File locations Test Plan: \nttest\base\filesystem\plans\pinpoint_fat_corruption_testplan.doc Test sources (common): \nttest\base\filesystem\Utilities\chkdsk_corrupt_fat\* Related test plan (NTFS): \nttest\base\filesystem\Utilities\chkdsk_corrupt_ntfs\chkdsk_plan.doc Related test sources (NTFS): \nttest\base\filesystem\Utilities\chkdsk_corrupt_ntfs\* Overview The current approach for testing chkdsk utility is to randomly corrupt a volume using simbad.sys driver, which randomly drops write operation during regular disk activity. But we wish not to depend of such random corruption and to have some definitive way of corrupting the tested volume in order to ensure all new additions to chkdsk don t break its old functionality. BenL created pinpoint corruption test for NTFS volumes. The goal in front of this test plan is to do the same for FAT/FAT32 volumes. Some FAT background About boot sector (for FAT32) Offset (byte) Size (bytes) Description jmpBoot jmp instruction to   code OEMName MSWIN4.1 bytes per sector Count of bytes per sector.  sectors per cluster Number of sectors per allocation unit. reserved sectors Number of reserved sectors after the extended boot record plus the size of the boot record and extended boot record.  Usually 32, but NOT always. number of FATs Reserved Entries Reserved (this field used to contain the number of root directory entries). Must be zero (this is the old bsSectors field).  media descriptor 0xF8  sectors per FAT Must be zero to indicate the BPB represents a FAT32 BPB . System will not boot if this field is zero and the count of clusters is < 65527. sectors per Track Sectors per track for interrupt 13h count of heads Number of heads for interrupt 13h count of hidden sectors Hidden sectors in partition so boot loader can do int 13h. count of sectors  Total number of sectors for all data structures and data for this drive. Big sectors per FAT DWORD count of sectors in a single file allocation table (FAT). Extended flags Bits 0-3               -- zero based number of active FAT,     only valid if mirroring is disabled Bits 4-6 -- reserved. Bit      7 -- zero means the FAT is mirrored     at runtime into all FATs. -- one means only one FAT is active,     it is the one referenced in bits 0-3. Bits 8-15  -- reserved. FS version High byte is major revision number. Low byte is minor revision number.  This document defines the version to 0:0.  If this field is non-zero, back-level Windows versions will not mount the volume. Note:  Disk Utilities should respect this field and not operate on volumes with a higher major or minor version number than that for which they were designed. First Cluster of Root Cluster number of the first cluster of the root directory, usually 2.  Note:  Disk Utilities that change the location of the root directory should make every effort to place the first cluster of the root directory in the first non-bad cluster on the drive (i.e. in cluster 2, unless it s marked bad).   FS info sector number Sector number of FS info structure. Usually 1.  Note that there will be a copy of the FSINFO structure in BackupBoot, but only the copy pointed to by this field will be kept up to date - i.e. both the primary and backup boot record will point to the same FSINFO sector. Backup Boot Record sector number. If non zero, indicates the sector number of a copy of the boot record. Usually 6. Reserved Reserved for future expansion. Drive Number Int 13h drive number (e.g. 80h). Reserved1 Reserved (used by Windows NT). Boot signature Extended boot signature (29h). Volume ID Volume serial number Volume label Volume label File System type FAT32    About directory entries For purposes of differentiating them from "long" directory entries, the familiar conventional MS-DOS directory entry is referred to as a "short" directory entry.  The structure of a FAT file system directory entry llows.  DIR_ENTRY STRUC dir_name db 11 DUP ; 8.3-style name stored in OEM character set dir_attr ; Attributes dir_OS ; Reserved for OS specific use dir_CreateMsec ; Creation millisec - # of 10 millisec intervals in 2 sec create time dir_CreateTime ; Creation time (DOS time format hrs/min/sec - 2 sec granularity) dir_CreateDate ; Creation date (DOS date format) dir_LastAccessDate ; Last accessed date dir_EAhandle ; Extended Attribute handle (zero for MS-DOS/Windows) dir_ModifyTime ; Last modified time dir_ModifyDate ; Last modified date dir_first_cluster ; First cluster in file's cluster chain dir_size ; Size of file in bytes DIR_ENTRY Note that the addition of a "last access date" and "creation date/time" field is new with Chicago.  The "OS field" is reserved. Currently NT uses a couple of bits in the first directory entry in the root as volume dirty bits.  It also uses a couple of other bits for flagging an optimized directory entry.  Usage of these bits by an OS should cause no functional difference between OSes. The EAhandle field is not used by MS-DOS or Windows, but is an artifact of additions that were made to the FAT file system to support other operating systems. All short directory entries, whether they designate volume labels, directories, or files, have an identical structure.  The attribute field within this structure differentiates volume-labels, directories, and files from one another.  Bits 4-3 within the attribute field contain bit flags that are used for differentiating directory entries from one another.  The following values for bits 4-3 indicate the type of file system object that the directory entry designates. ;            Bit 4       Bit 3 A_VOL A_DIR A_FILE Note that a combination resulting in an attribute value of 18h is missing.  This combination would specify an entry that was both a volume-label and a directory, which would be contradictory.  Suppose one were to set these bits in an existing directory entry "manually" via a disk editor, since there is no way to do this with a MS-DOS API, and subsequently use a MS-DOS disk utility on a disk so modified.  What would occur?  Depending on the disk utility, file-system-specific information, like a cluster chain, or file data is usually destroyed by the utility.  This is because such an object is not "valid" as far as some disk utilities are concerned and they will take steps to "fix" the problem. The following values for bits 5 and 2-0 indicate miscellaneous attributes that a directory entry may also possess.  The MS-DOS APIs: Get/SetAttribute allow any or all of these attributes to be changed. A_RD_ONLY ; Read-only file/directory flag. A_HID ; Hidden flag A_SYS ; System flag A_ARC ; Archive flag There is an exception to this rule: a volume-label cannot have system, hidden, and read-only attributes associated with it.  There is no MS-DOS API that allows an application to create or modify the attributes of a volume-label, such that the system, hidden, and read-only attribute bits are set.  When searching for a volume label, any short directory entry that has a volume label attribute and appears anywhere other than the root directory, is ignored by MS-DOS.  These properties are used in conjunction with long directory entries. Depending on the file system object, some of the fields in a directory entry are not relevant.  For example, a volume-label has neither a "first cluster" nor "file size" (i.e. the dir_first_cluster and dir_file_size fields are set to zero).  A directory has no "file size" (i.e. the dir_file_size field is set to zero) but does have a "first cluster". In order to meet the goals of locality-of-access and transparency, the long directory entry is defined as a short directory entry with a special attribute.  A long directory entry is a directory entry in which the attribute field has a value of: A_LONG ; Same as (A_RD_ONLY | A_HID | A_SYS | A_VOL) A mask for determining whether an entry is a long-name sub-component should also be defined: A_LONG_MASK ; Same as (A_RD_ONLY | A_HID | A_SYS | A_VOL | A_DIR | A_ARC) When such a directory entry is encountered it is given special treatment by the file system.  It is treated as part of a set of directory entries that are associated with a single short directory entry. A directory entry, which has an attribute of A_LONG, has a structure, which differs substantially from a conventional short directory entry. The structure of a long directory entry containing components of a long name follows.  LONGNAME_ENTRY STRUC ldir_ord ; The order of this entry in the sequence of long dir entries  ; associated with the short dir entry at the end of the long dir set. ldir_name1 db 10 dup ; Characters 1-5 of the long-name sub-component in this dir entry. ldir_attr ; Attributes - must be A_LONG. ldir_type ; If zero, indicates a directory entry which is a sub-component of a ; long name.  NOTE: Other values reserved for future extensions. ; Non-zero implies other dirent types. ldir_chksum ; Checksum of name in the short dir entry at the end of the long dir set. ldir_name2 db 12 dup ; Characters 6-11 of the long-name sub-component in this dir entry. ldir_first_clust ; Must be ZERO. This is an artifact of the FAT "first cluster" and must be  ; zero for compatibility with existing disk utilities.  It's meaningless in the  ; context of a long dir entry. ldir_name3 db 4  dup (?) ; Characters 12-13 of the long-name sub-component in this dir entry. LONGNAME_ENTRY Flags used in the ldir_ord field: LAST_LONG_ENTRY equ   01000000b ; Indicates the last long dir entry in a set of long dir entries.  Used to  ; determine if a set of long dir entries has been truncated by a disk utility. A set of long entries is always associated with a short entry, which they always immediately precede.  Long entries are paired with short entries for one reason: only short directory entries are visible to previous versions of MS-DOS/Windows.  Without a short entry to accompany it, a long directory entry would be completely invisible on previous versions of MS-DOS/Windows.  A long entry never legally exists all by itself.  If long entries are found without being paired with a valid short entry, they are termed orphans.  Figure 4 depicts a set of n long directory entries associated with its single short entry. Long entries always immediately precede and are physically contiguous with, the short entry they are associated with.  The file system makes a few other checks to ensure that a set of long entries is actually associated with a short entry. First, every member of a set of long entries is uniquely numbered and the last member of the set is or'd with a flag indicating that it is, in fact, the last member of the set.  The ldir_ord field is used to make this determination.  The first member of a set has an ldir_ord value of one.  The nth long member of the set has a value of (n OR LAST_LONG_ENTRY).  Note that the ldir_ord field cannot have values of 0xE5 or 0x00.  These values have always been used by the file system to indicate a "free" directory entry, or the "last" directory entry in a cluster.  Values for ldir_ord do not take on these two values over their range.  Values for ldir_ord must run from 1 to (n OR LAST_LONG_ENTRY).  If they do not, the long entries are assumed to be "damaged" and are treated as orphans by the file system. Second, an 8-bit checksum is computed on the name contained in the short directory entry at the time the short and long directory entries are created.  All 11 characters of the name in the short entry are used in the checksum calculation.  The check sum is placed in every long entry.  If any of the check sums in the set of long entries do not agree with the computed checksum of the name contained in the short entry, then the long entries are treated as orphans.  This can occur if a disk containing long and short entries is taken to a previous version of MS-DOS/Windows and only the short name of a file or directory with long entries is renamed. A long name can consist of more characters than can fit in a single long directory entry.  When this occurs the name is stored in more than one long entry.  In any event, the name fields themselves within the long entries are disjoint.  The following example is provided to illustrate how a long name is stored across several long directory entries.  Names are also NUL terminated and padded with 0xFFFF characters in order to detect corruption of long name fields by errant disk utilities.  A name that fits exactly in a long directory entries (i.e. is an integer multiple of 13) is not NUL terminated and not padded with 0xFFFFs. Suppose a file is created with the name: "The quick brown.fox".  The following example illustrates how the name is packed into long and short directory entries.  Most fields in the directory entries are also filled in as well. About FAT entries The File Allocation Table is a packed list of  12/16/32-bit entries which have a one-for-one mapping with the data clusters.   Each entry is defined as (for 32bit case): Bit Offset  Size (bits) Description cluster value 0x00000000 unallocated cluster 0x00000001 invalid value  0x00000002 - 0x0FFFFFF7 allocated cluster in chain 0x0FFFFFF7 bad cluster mark (but only if not part of a cluster chain or not a legal cluster number.  NOTE:  this means this can be a valid cluster number in a cluster chain!) 0x0FFFFFF8 - 0x0FFFFFFF end of File Reserved Reserved for future use.

Exercise the cache manager at its limits. Simulate activity of real world server applications on the file system. Test system utilities for correctness in handling large numbers.  Accumulate Knowledge Base issues regarding known problems and incorporate into tests.  File system scalability tests These tests may be categorized into the following. Basic tests on a large file File size limits Limit on number of files or directories Distribution of files Operations on large files Fragmentation of files (both system and user files) Real world usage scenarios New APIs (like VLM apis) Basic tests on a large file Create Shrink Truncate Encrypt Compress GetRetrievalPointers Defrag Mapped I/O Scatter Gather I/O Lock, UnLock Delete NTFS specifc   hard links, large alternate data streams, a large number of alternate data streams, and both NT5 specific - Make Sparse, Create Reparse Point, Set Object ID Check operations over network Backup / Restore Virus filters Test strategy for basic largefile tests: The following chunk sizes will be used when reading and writing files are   1byte, 64kb, 4gb, 64gb. Create a very large FileA ( > 250gb ).  Grow it with WriteFile Grow it with SetFilePointer, SetEndOfFile Shrink it with SetFilePointer, SetEndOfFile ReadFile in the beginning, middle and end of the file Attempt Scatter Gather I/O in the beginning, middle and end of the file Do random mapped I/O over the entire file range Lock and UnLock chunks in beginning, middle, end of file and also entire file EncryptFile()   NTFS5 only DecryptFile()   NTFS5 only Test FSCTL_GET_RETRIEVAL_POINTERS Test FSCTL_MOVE_FILE Repeat steps 2-10 re-opening file with FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN Repeat steps 2-10 re-opening file with FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_SCAN Repeat steps 2-10 re-opening file with FILE_FLAG_TEMPORARY Repeat steps 2-10 re-opening file with FILE_FLAG_UNBUFFERED Repeat steps 2-15 on a large alternate data stream - NTFS only Copy FileA with large alternate data stream to a new file, FileB Truncate default data stream on FileA Close FileA Delete FileA Create HardLink FileC to FileB Open FileB with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE Close FileB Delete FileC and verify all files are gone Repeat steps 2-16 on a large sparse file - NTFS5 only Repeat steps 1-26 on local, compressed, remote and remote-compressed volumes File Size Limits Any decent filesystem will store file sizes as atleast 64bit values. Current disk storage capacity hasn t yet reached anywhere near this. It is indeed doubtful that disks will become as large in the near and mid future. So for all practical test purposes, we can assume that the max file size creatable is constrained by the amount of free disk space.  Sparse files can have a size greater than the volume space. If quotas are enforced, then file size should be able to grow upto the quota limit. Test Strategy: Create as large a volume as possible Create a file as big as the free space on the volume  Set quotas to max values and create a file as big as the quota will permit Limit on number of files or directories This should be limited only by the volume size. Some file systems may impose a limit, on say the number of directories in the root of the volume. Such limitations are file system specific. Test Strategy: On NTFS volumes, small files are stored in the file record and aren t allocated clusters.  This test to create files in a situation where there are no free clusters and the only space the files will fit is in the file records. Create as large a volume as possible Create N,  zero length files until volume is full Delete N / 2 files Try creating files of size > File Record Segment size. Must fail. Recreate N / 2 files of size < File Record Segment size. Must succeed.  Directory tree tests.  Create as large a volume as possible. Create a  directory tree 32 levels deep, where each directory has 2 subdirectories. We will refer to this tree structure hereafter as TreeType1. Create, write, read, close and delete a file in a leaf dir Delete directory tree Create as many directories in the root as possible Delete directory tree Create a single subdirA under the root and create as many directories as possible in it. We will refer to this tree structure hereafter as TreeType2 Delete subdirA Create a directory tree where each dir has only one subdir. Use single character  directory names to achieve maximm depth. We will refer to this tree structure hereafter as TreeType3 Create, write, read, close and delete a file in the leaf dir Delete directory tree Distribution of Files on real world servers To find how file systems are used in real world servers, a survey was conducted. Results of the survey are in   HYPERLINK \\\\plans\\ntbaset\\largefile\\casestudy.xls  \\plans\ntbaset\largefile\casestudy.xls A description of the Terraserver  is given below.  TerraServer The Microsoft  TerraServer stores aerial and satellite images of the earth in phaServer from Compaq and StorageWorks hardware.  EMBED Word.Picture.8   The TerraServer's physical database design is very simple. The database is mapped onto 4 huge disk volumes, each volume is almost 600 GB. Hardware RAID5 provided by Digital StorageWorks converts 324 disks into 28 large RAID5 disks. Windows NT software striping (RAID0) is used to convert these 28 disks into four huge logical volumes. Therefore, SQL Server, Enterprise Edition sees four huge disks.  To ease tape handling, and to provide some granularity of backup and recovery, thirty 20 GB files are defined on each disk. Thus there are a total of 120 (4x20) files used by the SQL Server. These files are grown on demand by SQL and NT as the database fills. For more information   HYPERLINK http://terraserver.microsoft.com  http://terraserver.microsoft.com File I/O pattern on real world servers Internet Information Server (IIS)  IIS being a internet server under peak conditions of load deals with a large number of files being transmitted over the network. Depending on the type of server we might be dealing with a large number of small files, a typical web server, and larger files in case of FTP servers. IIS uses the TransmitFile() API to send files over sockets. It would be interesting to write a stress test for this API to run under iostress. It should also be kept in mind that internet servers are usually dedicated machines, and probably have optimized networking and caching code. So a TransmitFile() stress in regular iostress may not truly simulate the real world. Proxy Server The following information was provided by NeelJ and JoseSua. Microsoft Proxy Server routes requests and responses between the Internet and client computers, acting as a liaison between them. In addition to routing requests, Proxy Server provides a cache of frequently requested Internet sites, blocks access to specified sites, and provides secure access between your internal network and the Internet. Proxy Server also offers extensible firewall security features From the filesystem point of view, we are interestred in the caching done. Cached data is stored as regular files directory buckets hashed according to the filenames. The filenames directly reflect the http addressess.  When a client requests a file, the Proxy checks to see if the file is in the cache. If it is and its time to live (TTL) has not expired, then the file is sent to the client using the TransmitFile() API. The cache hit rate on a production machine is about 25%. If the file isn t in the cache, then it is retrieved from the web server, stored in the cache (CreateFile and OverwriteFile) and returned to the user. Unused files are deleted as and when disk space becomes scarce.    TransmitFile() / ReadFile() Create/Overwrite     Read/Update           Async,buffered I/O Delete     TTL, timestamps Proxy 4-5 directory buckets storing about 50,000   100,000 files SQL Servers The following information about database I/O is from the Microsoft SQL Server Programmer s toolkit.   Database systems store data in a logical collection of disk files or disk partitions. The physically atomic unit of a database file is referred to as a database page. The typical size of a database page is 2 or 4kb. Changing the page size from the default has rarely demonstrated any measurable performance gains. Physical reads and writes of the data are done by the database page. Therefore, disk requests are usually 2KB.  The process of executing I/O routines is similar across most database systems. Reads of database pages are done by database process(es) or thread(s) for the application. Many read operations can usually be conducted in parallel and each is independent of each other. Writes of data pages, on the other hand, are not initiated by a user application. When an application updates or inserts new data, the change is actually put into the database cache by the application's database process. Some time later an independent database function will clean the dirty data pages from memory. These writes will usually occur as a large batch of asynchronous writes.  In contrast to the data pages, writes of transaction log pages is a very steady stream of single pages writes. These occur during update and insert operations and again is controlled by a background database process. Application Types: By examining different database applications and database functions, the fundamental I/O profile used to access the disk can be determined. What this determines is whether a particular dataset will be accessed either sequentially or randomly. The key high-level application types include transaction processing, decision support systems, and batch processing. In this section we will examine the various access patterns on the database files. The distinct file types to be examined are data and index files, transaction logs, and import/export files. Transaction Processing (OLTP) OLTP is usually characterized as many users acting on a small subset of data throughout the database. The I/O profile resulting from this load is very heavy random reads and writes across the data and index files. The transaction logs, however, are hit with a heavy stream of sequential write operations of 2K or less. Decision Support System (DSS) DSS is characteristic of multiple users executing complicated joins and aggregations on large sets of data. Even though many of the operations could use some sequential processing, contention with other users and join and indexing operation result in a fairly random access pattern to the data and index files. Usually, if the database is dedicated to DSS no updates will be done to the database during heavy query load. In this case, no I/O will occur on the transaction logs. If on-line updates are applied to the database, it must be remembered that log file response time may still be important to the overall performance of the system. Batch Processing Batch processing is the most likely application to produce significant sequential I/O on the data files. The types of activities referred to here often occur after hours and usually in isolation of other activities. Batch processing involves database dumps, database loads, detail report processing, and index creation.

The STM files are the message store. Incoming messages are written into them. The writes are write through and are usually in 4kb sizes or broken into chunks of 32-64kb for larger messages. These writes are also sequential in nature spanning 2mb blocks in the STM file. The Jet database stores pointers to these message segements (in the STM file) as scatter-gather lists. So retrieving messages involves random sector/page size scatter-gather i/o. Messages are sent out using TransmitFile() and the file handles are  The EDB file contains the JET database holding user messages. (remember the message bodies are themselves kept in the STM files). The EDB file are about 5-100gb (typically 30% of STM file size). The i/o is 4kb random read writes. The read to write ratio is about 3:2. Elevator write schemes and extensive LRU2 caching of useful pages is done. Jet also maintains several log files. These files are about 5mb in size and there new files are created and accumulate until cleaned up after backup. In a typical day 100s of such logs can accumulate. The writes to the log are 512 byte sequential writes. The logs usually don t need to be read (except for say recovery purposes). The STM, EDB and log files need to be distributed on different spindles for maximum performance. Message size distribution is  typically like       Number of messages Exchange Platinum Server block diagram:      JET WriteThru msg size (4kb) or in  32-64kb chunks for larger msgs TransmitFile     Sector/Page size unbuffered      unbuffered (mostly 4kb)     random scatter 4kb random         512 byte     gather i/o read writes 3:2  sequential writes Handle cache 100,000 handles       STM file       2mb                      EDB file    Log file           50-100gb, 10s of files     5-100gb.

File sizes vary from very small (10K) to very large (2G).  A typical server deployed for Internet access would generally have a bunch of files in the ~1M size range. The number of files varies all over the map.  Just as with web servers, the number of files depends on how rich the sight is.  Some sites have ~10 pieces of content and some have over 10,000. Files are copied in place by the admin.  Content manipulation isn t currently a feature of NetShow.  The server doesn t create any directory structure.  The admin can put their content anywhere they want to. Files are accessed using un-buffered asynchronous reads.  The size of these reads is anywhere from 8K to 500K depending on bitrate of the ASF file.  For a typical Internet deployment, the reads will usually be 8K or 16K. The Tiger Server uses raw partitions (TroyBa) and so is not of much use from a file system perspective. File Access Patterns It has been found that the Zipf Law distribution is a good aproximation of file access pattern. According this Law, if we have N number of total files and P(I) denotes  [my equation editor on ms-word does not work! ..to be done] Fragmentation We can have fragmentation of files, directories, system files, free space. Tests: Create two maximally fragmented files by interleaving their creation.  Try to read and write to the beginning, middle and end. Delete one of the files. Copy remaining file to a new file Get retrieval pointers on it and verify Defrag volume, and verify number of file fragments reported by defragger Convert such a disk from FAT32 to NTFS. Create a fragmented directory (need to find out how?) Create fragmentation of the MFT  Create fragmentation of the $BADCLUS file Fill up volume with N number of cluster sized files Delete alternate files, creating free space fragmentation Create a new file of size (N/2) * cluster size API Tests Create a 250gb file   FileA CopyFile Copy FileA to FileB CopyFileEx Use CopyFileEx to copy FileA to FileB. Try the following variation.  Use CopyFileEx with COPY_FILE_RESTARTABLE flag, fail the copy after 100gb has been copied, restart the copy and check if copy completes. CopyProgressRoutine Monitor progress of the above largefile copy. Note: This function takes a StreamNumber argument which is a DWORD. So does this mean that the max number of streams a file can have is 2^32 ? Might be a good system limit to prod! DeleteFile Delete a large contiguous file Delete a maximally fragmented file  FindFirstChangeNotification / FindNextchangeNotification Watch for notification on the TreeType1, 2 and 3 when modifying a file in the furthest leaf. Also watch for notification in the zero length file creation tests. This tests creates a bazillion number of files and it ll be good to find out that notification will still work FindFirstFile / FindNextFile These APIs must be keeping track of which file in the directory they are returning. If they are using a DWORD somewhere as an index, then they will not work for more than 2^32 files. Test! GetCurrentDirectory Do this check in the leaves of TreeType3. GetDiskFreeSpace / GetDiskFreeSpaceEx TotalNumberOfClusters is a DWORD. So see if format (both gui and cmd line) will work on a very large volume with a very small cluster size..(ie: number of clusters > 2^32). They should fail properly. GetFileAttributes / GetFileAttributesEx This function takes a filename argument. So provide it with the name of the file in TreeType3 GetFileInformationByHandle On the file in the leaf of a TreeType3 dir On a large file and verify return fields nFileSizeHigh and nFileSizeLow On a file with a large number of hard links and verify return field nNumberOfLinks Number of hardlinks returned by this API is a DWORD. So verify if this limit is present during hard link creation GetFileSize Test on large file GetFileType Test on large file GetFullPathName / GetLongPathName / GetShortPathName Test on file in a TreeType3 dir. GetTempFileName Test on getting a temp file name in the TreeType3 dir where the full path length is hit or exceeded. Test on a directory where there are already files that having all possible values of the  uUnique parameter, which is a UINT. GetTempPath Set temp path to the deepest directory in a TreeType3 dir.. Then call GetTempPath and verify. LockFile(Ex) / UnLockFile(Ex) Covered under basic file tests MoveFile / MoveFileEx Test on Large file Broadest and Deepest directory tree as a whole and after pruning to create some disk space Create a subdirA in the root, fill it up with zero size files, delete half the files and move subdirA to subdirB. This will test moves totally confined to MFT file records. Test the above 3 cases with MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT specified to MoveFileEx ReadDirectoryChangesW Test by setting a watch on the root of the TreeType2 and 3 dirs trees and modifying a file in the leaf node. ReadFile(Ex) / ReadFileGather Covered in basic large file tests. ReadFileVlm Is anyone testing this? SearchPath Search for a file in the extremities of dir TreeType1, 2 and 3 WriteFile(Ex) / WriteFileGather Covered in Basic large file tests. WriteFileVlm Is anyone testing this? ACL Tests Performance testing Performance testing is done to simulate large loads on the server. This is very application specific, and the NT performance group has specific people analyzing different applications. Contact people are  NeelJ Exchange   PerryC  SQL Server   MauriceF From what I have seen, general purpose file systems like NTFS bite the bullet when it comes to driving up application specific performance. The current trend of major server apps seems to be to bypass the file system in some way or other to achieve higher performance. In fact SQL goes to the extreme extent of using a raw partition on its own. There is a lot of NT performance data collected and stored on http://ntperformance PAGE   PAGE

Narrieta   Original version. Overview Starting in version 5.0, NT will allow the user to change the name of any of the data streams in a file. This will be done using the existing interface provided by the function NtSetInformationFile and the information class FileRenameInformation. Declarations of the function and its input buffer follow NTSTATUS NtSetInformationFile(     IN HANDLE  FileHandle,     OUT PIO_STATUS_BLOCK  IoStatusBlock,     IN PVOID  FileInformation,     IN ULONG  Length,     IN FILE_INFORMATION_CLASS  FileInformationClass typedef struct _FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION {     BOOLEAN  ReplaceIfExists;     HANDLE  RootDirectory;     ULONG  FileNameLength;     WCHAR  FileName[1]; } FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION, *PFILE_RENAME_INFORMATION; There are a few preconditions for a renaming operation to succeed: The handle to the stream must be opened with FILE_NON_DIRECTORY_FILE. FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION.FileName must identify a stream in the same object (::$DATA, :NAME, or :NAME:$DATA). It s illegal to move (rename) a stream between objects. Renaming to an existing stream is allowed only if FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION.ReplaceIfExists is set and the stream is zero length. Renaming the default data stream is allowed, but leaves behind a zero-length default data stream Regression tests Streams used in the test should contain known data. The success of a rename operation should be verified by checking that data and attributes can be accessed using the new name and can t be accessed using the old name (if different to the new name). Failure should be verified in a similar way.  When the default data stream is renamed, verify that a zero-length default stream is left behind.  In the following descriptions, object denotes a directory or file, file a file, dir a directory and stream a stream. Basic scenarios Rename from Comment :stream :stream:$DATA file::$DATA :stream file::$DATA :stream:$DATA object:stream1 :stream2 Also try stream1 == stream2 object:stream1 :stream2:$DATA Also try stream1 == stream2 File renaming dir:stream ::$DATA Failure: the default data stream of a directory can t be renamed file:stream Failure: streams can t be moved across objects ReplaceIfExists For these scenarios the target stream must exist prior to the rename operation and must contain some data. Try ReplaceIfExists not set and verify failure, also verify that the target stream is unaffected. Then try ReplaceIfExists set  and verify failure. Finally, delete the data from the stream, retry (ReplaceIfExists set) and verify success. Rename from Comment ::$DATA file::$DATA  ::$DATA file:stream1 ::$DATA :stream file::$DATA :stream object:stream1 :stream2 RootDirectory Use a valid handle in FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION.RootDirectory and verify that the operation fails ( relative  stream renaming is not allowed). FILE_NON_DIRECTORY_FILE Try some of the scenarios above, but do not use FILE_NON_DIRECTORY_FILE when opening the source stream. Verify failure. Target name  Verify failure when the name is too long or contains illegal characters (0x00-0x1f, ", /, <, >, ?, |, *). May want to try a few variations of   :stream: :stream:$X , etc. Concurrent renaming  Verify that renaming can be done concurrently from different processes.

Last Updated : Oct.20th, 1999
                            

Doc\
	This folder contains documents for ActiveWire USB board.
	The same can be viewed on our web site at http://www.activewireinc.com.

                            
Driver\
	This folder contains ActiveWire Windows driver installation files.
	After you receive your ActiveWire USB, you must install these drivers.
                                
         1. Plug the ActiveWire board into your USB port.
         2. The Windows operating system will automatically detect ActiveWire USB
	    and prompt you to install a driver.
	    Specify location of this folder then Windows will automatically install them.
         3. That's all it takes to get started! 
            Restart Windows if you are asked to do so. It's usually not necessary.
                                
	USB makes driver installation quick and easy.
	Now, let's start exploring possibility of ActiveWire USB!!

	Driver Revision history:

		1.02 (May 19th,1999)	:	Fixed problem in OCX with Visual Basic 

		1.03 (Jun.22nd,1999)	:	Added DLL interface support with Visual Basic.
						Enhanced error message reporting.

		1.04 (Oct.20th,1999)	:	Added Windows 2000 support.
						Fixed a few minor firmware/DLL bugs.

                                

AwusbIO.exe
        This is a sample application to control I/O port of ActiveWire USB board.
        It's for you to try your ActiveWire USB board.
                                
                                
Src\
	This folder contains source files of the sample applications.
	VisualC++\ sub-folder contains code written using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. 
	You can also use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
	VisualBaisc\ sub-folder contains 2 examples written using Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0.
	One example uses DLL interface, the another uses ActiveX (OCX) interface.
	You can also use Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.
	Feel free to use it as a reference for your own design.
                                
                                
HTML\
	This folder contains samples of HTML file with Java Script using following ActiveX control.
	Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or above is required.
	Please set Security option of Internet Explorer to Low when you browse this page.

AwusbIO.ocx  
	This is ActiveX Control for the ActiveWire USB board.
        To install ActiveX Control in your system, first install ActiveWire Windows driver, 
	then type in command like following at command prompt.
                                
	 C:>	c:\windows\system\regsvr32.exe	d:\your_folder\AwusbIO.ocx
                                
	In this example, I assumed your Windows directory is C:\Windows, and you saved the .OCX 
	file in d:\your_folder\.
	You must perform this command again with new pathname if you moved/renamed the .OCX file. 
	A window should pop up saying the library is successfully registerd.
        If pop-up window indicates failure or error, try re-install the driver.

RegClear.exe
	This is a utility program written specifically for troubleshooting ActiveWire USB driver installation.
	If there were an anomally during first time driver installation (power failure, corrupted disk, etc.),
	the Windows Registry Database will maintain incorrect information, preventing proper driver installation.
        If that occurs, run this utility and restart Windows. Then simply repeat the procedure for driver installation.
        This utility was actually written so that we could easily repeat driver installation for testing purposes.

This is a sample Visual Basic project.

This example uses DLL in Visual Basic.

DLL older than ver.1.02 will have a problem running this sample.

Please update your driver to ver.1.03 or above.

Please note that the name of DLL file to use with Visual Basic is ''awusbvb.dll'' instead of awusb.dll that is for C++.

This is a sample Visual Basic project.

This example uses ActiveX component(OCX) in Visual Basic.


To install ActiveX Control, first install ActiveWire Windows driver, then follow steps below.

  1. Download the OCX file and save to your local hard drive.
  2. Open a DOS box, and type in command like following ;

 C:>  c:\windows\system\regsvr32.exe d:\your_folder\AwusbIO.ocx

 In this example, I assumed your Windows directory is C:\Windows, and you saved the .OCX file in d:\your_folder\.
  You must perform this command again with new pathname if you moved/renamed the .OCX file. 
 A window should pop up saying the library is successfully registered.
 If pop-up window indicates failure or error, try re-install the driver.

DiskTest documentation for the hardware team

Here is what the hardware team wants:
2.3	Hard Disk Drive

The HDD software test applet will provide a method for measuring the following critical hard drive parameters:
-	Startup Time - from power on to Drive Ready  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Startup Time - from Standby to Drive Ready  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Spindown Time - from Standby Command  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Spindown Time - from power off (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Seek/Read Time (not compatible with the way the OS works)
-	Seek/Write Time (not compatible with the way the OS works)
*	Data Transfer Rate, Sustained (*can use existing filesystem tests)

-       Additionally the test tool will provide a mechanism for reading and writing data and files to any specified location on the hard disk. (nope!)

-The test applet will allow each HDD command to be sent in each of the following modes:
-	DMA MultiWord modes 0-3 (nope)
-	DMA-33 (nope)
-	PIO Modes 0-2 (nope)

+The Test applet will be able to support the SMART self-test features of the hard drive and report self test results.
        SMART test:
                SMART READ DATA
                SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE
                SMART SAVE ATTRIBUTE VALUES
                SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE
                SMART ENABLE OPERATIONS
                SMART DISABLE OPERATIONS
                SMART RETURN STATUS

Here is what they are going to get:
*        identify attached devices - done

*        SMART test - done

*        Full-Stroke Seek Time (inner track to outer track, and outer track to inner track combines) - done (may have to tweak when we get real hardware)
*        Track-to-Track Seek Time - inner tracks, middle tracks, outer tracks - done


Here is how it works:
The test enumerates all devices, and calls each test for each device.
If the device supports the commands required to perform the tests, 
it performs the test, otherwise it returns.

USB status information is build into the TELNET server.
From the command prompt, type either of the following commands:

STATS /DEV

USB [time]


STATS enumerates the connected devices and shows basic information about them.
USB dumps the button state of any connected XID device. The [time] option 
lets you configure how long the dump will last in seconds.

You can also type "HELP" at the prompt to get further information on the

CD Rip is a utility that will Rip a CD to the Xbox
Hard Drive in the same way that the Xbox Dashboard
Rips a CD to the Xbox Hard Drive.  It will provide
timing and error information that can be used to
compare one type of DVD Drive to another.

Disk Read (diskRead.xbe)
Written by Josh Poley
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.


Disk Read is a low level disk (hard drive and dvd)
scanning utility. The test attempts to read the sectors 
specified in the configuration, either with a call to 
NtReadFile (hard drive or dvd drive), or DeviceIoControl 
(dvd drive only).

Any errors reported by the device or the OS will be 
logged. Data can be verified by issuing two reads per 
address (use the NumberOfReads=2 setting).

Disk Write (diskWrite.xbe)
Written by Josh Poley
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.


Disk Write is used to test IO on the hard disk. It has the
following test modes:

    1)  Low Level Scan - This test reads, writes, and then
        reads again from the sectors specified in the 
        configuration file. This test can be used to verify
        that IO is possible at every address.

    2)  Create Files - This test uses the filesystem to 
        create up to 2048 files of varying sizes (1 to 4k).

These tests will be run in the software test lab (where it can communicate with a backend database to store results), and by the various hardware vendors (typically without backend support).  Goals Provide a set of tests that can be run as a suite or individually Make it very easy to run tests Supply a uniform user interface for configuring the tests The main user interface and all tests should support free versions of libraries (so they can be retail signed) Components Database Owner: jpoley The database will store release criteria for each type of test and all of the results from the test runs. Web Site Owner: jpoley From a web site, a user will be able to view the results on any hardware component or test, along with whether or not that component has passed the supplied release requirements. Administrator style access will allow appropriate users to configure the release criteria and purge old results from the database. User Interface Owner: jimhelm The main application provides the primary user interface for the tests. From this launcher a user can perform the following tasks: Configure a test to run in a specific mode (by modifying the test s settings) Run a test Configure a collection of tests to run in specific modes Run a collection of tests View results from the previous test or collection Save the test configurations to either the hard drive or an MU Test Library Owner: jpoley The test library provides a collection of functions that each test needs in order to work with the backend database and with the launcher. Database Schema Results Table Column Name Description Unique identifier for the row Timestamp datetime Date and time when the entry was created Device Type char[32] The type of the hardware component Manufacturer char[32] Who made the device Firmware Version char[32] Firmware version Hardware Version char[32] Hardware version Serial Number char[32] Serial number Test Name char[64] Test application name Variation char[256] Description of operation or test Status 0=fail, 1=pass Number of Operations bigint Box Information Complete list of components + version numbers for sw and hw Config Settings Complete configuration setting for the test Notes Reason or further information on any failures Acceptance Table Column Name Description Test Name char[64] Links to [Test Name] in the results table Percentage float Notes Information describing the Percentage Launcher Requirements The launcher will have a title ID of 48570000. When a test is run, the launcher will call XLaunchNewImage and pass this structure: struct ToTestData { DWORD titleID; // always == 48570000 unsigned short testNumber; // test # out of totalTests unsigned short totalTests; char configSettings[0]; Screens Test List This screen shows a complete list of all available tests. Selecting a test will show you a listing of saved configurations for that test. From there you can create a new one, edit an existing, or run the test with the given configuration. Hitting a different button while a Test is selected will bring up a recent summary of test results and whether or not they meet the acceptance criteria (all information pulled from the web). Edit Single Test Configuration This is where the user can define the settings for a specific test. The launcher must parse out the configuration schema supplied by the title in order to know what settings are available. The schema file for each test will have the following format: field name, help text,  number , default, min, max field name, help text,  range , default1, min1, max1, default2, min2, max2 field name, help text,  string , default, option2, option3, option4  Sample Config Schema File Device, Pick a device, string, \Device\cdrom0, \Device\Harddisk0\Partition0 ReadSizeMin, Read size in blocks, number, 32, 1, 1024 ReadSizeMax, Read size in blocks, number, 32, 1, 1024 StartLBA, Start address, number, 0, 0, 9999999 EndLBA, End address, number, 0, 0, 9999999 Build Collection Here, the user groups together multiple custom test configurations to define a sequence of tests that will be run one after the other. Results Screen After a test or collection runs the user can view the results as they are passed back from the test. It is also possible to keep the frame buffer across the reboots and show them directly to the user. Launcher Initialization File ResultsServer ; Define the web server where the results can be queried StartUp ; Specify a config or collection to automatically run Test Requirements Tests will have a title ID of 4857xxxx (starting at 0001). If no configuration information is passed into the test via the LAUNCH_DATA, then the test will run with default settings. If the test was launched via the HVS launcher then it will reboot back to that application passing the following structure: struct ToLauncherData { DWORD titleID; unsigned __int64 numPass; unsigned __int64 numFail; char notes[0]; Otherwise it must reboot back to the default title.
