One of the primary changes is to have components which require instrumentation to send log information directly to the reporting  cleansing server . The cleansing server is responsible for sanitizing logs from various components and inserting them into a database for later aggregation and reporting. By having log information sent directly to the cleansing server, it opens up the ability to obtain basic real time reporting, as well as removing a dependency on a log file collection system. The reporting instrumentation component must be robust; any issues must be easily and quickly caught by monitoring and the solution to the problem simple. Architecture The following is a simple diagram of the XManagement infrastructure in Xenon, as related to instrumentation.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   When any instrumentation is executed, the component logs to the XManagement area specified in the instrumentation line, and any targets which are enabled for that area receive the instrumentation information as well. Since the reporting target is a basic XManagement target, it can be plugged into any existing component with very little code change, if any is required. Feature Design Core Design Details The following is a class diagram of the primary classes used in instrumentation for reporting:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   CXomReportTarget is the parent class, and the only exposed one. It implements the XManagement target methods and maintains pointer to instances of a CReportConnection and a CServerSocket. From external appearances, its sole role is to take a message from the component and log it and return to the caller without blocking the thread. CReportConnection is a helper class used inside of CXomReportTarget. It takes the message from the target, and prepares it for transmission over the network. As such, this class is also responsible for handling errors that may occur during transmission. It maintains a pointer to a CServerSocket object. CReportConnection derives from the CTCPCnt class, and existing implementation. CServerSocket is a helper class built on top of Winsock APIs, and is an existing implementation. It handles the actual transmission of data over the network. CXomReportTarget Design Details From the point of view of the component, the following data flow occurs:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Internally, CXomReportTarget creates a thread (called the heartbeat thread) which is responsible for periodically checking the connection state of the underlying socket, as well as sending keep-alive messages to the cleansing server during periods of inactivity.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Message Protocol Details The reporting target uses unidirectional communication with the cleansing server.   EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   On startup, the target will notify the cleansing server of its initialization. As it receives instrumentation from the component, it sends data messages. Should the target not have sent a message for a while, it will send a keep-alive message to the cleansing server to indicate that although it is inactive, it is alive. Finally, on termination of the component, the target will send a disconnect message to the server. The wire protocol for the messages is as follows:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11       typedef struct {         byte bMsgType;         byte bReserved;         u_short usSize;         ULONGLONG ullTime;     } RPT_MSG_HEADER;     enum ReportMessageType {         RPT_MSG_CONNECT = 1,         RPT_MSG_DISCONNECT = 2,         RPT_MSG_DATA = 3,         RPT_MSG_KEEPALIVE = 4     }; The first byte in the message header represents the type of message, as defined in the ReportMessageType enum. The second byte is currently unused. The third and fourth bytes indicate the length of the payload   an unsigned. This is followed by a 64 bit long which is the timestamp of the message in FileTime format in UTC (in host byte order). For keep-alive and disconnect messages, the payload length will be 0. For the connect message, the payload will consist of two unsigned longs: the first long corresponds to the server id, while the second corresponds to the component id. This allows the cleansing server to associate the connection with a specific server/component pair. All data is sent in host byte order. Database Schema Details The reporting target retrieves all settings from the configuration database. Configuration of the reporting target itself takes place in t_settings table. Setting Value Purpose xmgmt_area report=Type=report; HeartBeatIntervalSec =15; KeepAliveIntervalSec =300 Type=report indicates to XManagement to add the reporting target to the target list for the component. HeartBeatIntervalSec is the number of seconds between each heart beat (verification of connectivity). KeepAliveIntervalSec is the number of seconds of inactivity after which point the reporting target will send a keep-alive message to the reporting server. xmgmt_area_<areaname> target=report  and if  enable  is present, set it to yes target=report to indicate that the area <areaname> is to send instrumentation data to the reporting target. enable=yes to turn on instrumentation for this area. Further configuration occurs in the t_interface_buckets table. Here, each server retrieves the cleansing server information. Here are how various columns are used for the reporting target. Column Value / Purpose vc_interface This must be set to  reporting i_title_id This must be set to 0. i_bucket This must be set to 0. vc_server This must be the name of the cleansing server. vc_next_server This value is currently ignored. vc_info1 This value is the cleansing server s port. Using the Reporting Target These are the steps required to enable the reporting target in a Xenon component: Initialize the XManagement infrastructure. Define an area for the purposes of instrumentation. They should be named componentReport  As per the t_settings, enable the reporting target on the report specific area. To send instrumentation data, merely use the XomLog macros, with the report specific area. For example:  * Some header code XomDefineArea(MycomponentReport);  * Service startup or main stuff     g_xomcentral.Init( MyComponent  * Some random function  function     XomLog1( MycomponentReport,  Server %d did something interesting , iParam1 ); Security All network traffic is done in cleartext, and there is no handshake protocol to determine the validity of the cleansing server. External Use Dependencies Performance Goals This target must have minimal impact in terms of CPU and memory usage, while being able to handle the expected instrumentation load. Capacity Planning This section should identify usage expectations and how this feature should be integrated into the overall capacity planning model. Operations The following events are thrown in error cases: EventType: XEVENT_COMM_FAILED_ERROR EventText: CXomReportTarget::HeartBeatThread() - Reporting target has lost connection to the cleansing server. Attempting to reconnect Reason: There is some issue with connectivity. The cleansing server may be down. There may be network connectivity issues. EventType: XEVENT_CONFIG_ERROR EventText: CXomReportTarget::Init() Reason: We either received an invalid I/O completion port object, we were unable to CoCreate the CommonConfig object, or we don t have correct settings specified in t_interface_buckets EventType: XEVENT_CODE_ERROR EventText: CReportConnection::Send failed, hr=0x%08X Reason: Send failed   this requires a lookup of the error code. Any parts of the feature that are cut from the spec should be moved to this section for consideration in future releases.

E%Ut @Uv XCA8* W@z39 $%:uj KaH%a!Mission Per BenKil there are 3 most critical features reporting team should concentrate on and provide solution for Xe launch: Subscribers  churn and subscription tiers usage. That information will help executives analyze the business.  Help marketing target different audiences.  Provide real-time reports about XBL service usage  System philosophy and main pillars Data warehouse should be maintainable. Data should be partitioned vertically (by time) at least, horizontal partitioning should be considered as well (final decision should be made based on system capacity analysis). Table size of an individual table should not exceed 10M records. How long we keep raw data? How long we keep aggregated data? What is the purging mechanism? Shall we archive data into a separate location and keep it available for longer time? How are we going to retrieve the data from archived location?  Automatic purging process should remove the data from the main reporting database. Based on data nature it should be permanently deleted or archived to different media. Reporting should add minimal load to Production servers. To minimize load created by reporting system on Production servers  all memory and CPU intensive operations should be handled by reporting servers.  Reporting system should track timestamp for every data source. At any given time it should know what data have been collected so far. In general daily processing should not start until all required data have been collected. If the data is missing due to service maintenance or outage, then processing of partial data available should be possible. Reporting system should have knowledge about actual status of every server. If the service goes offline for maintenance, reporting system should not expect any data coming from that particular server.  Shall we define a certain timeout (that could be configured) after which the processing starts regardless of availability of all collected data? It should be possible to rerun daily processing for certain day or range of days in the past to fix specific report(s) for specific date(s) without touching unrelated reports for the same time range. Reporting system should handle gracefully input errors. If a server generated specific input line that does not comply with a predefined format, the system should alert about invalid input and continue execution (as opposed to invalidating an entire batch of data received from that server). In many cases data generated by production server should undergo filtering by reporting system. That transformation should be schematized and configurable. Addition of new fields or even new type of server to collect data from should require configuration change at most and not writing a new parsing/filtering module.  SQL does not naturally support translation from/to local time to GMT.  All XBL servers use GMT format. To avoid inconsistencies the data in reporting system should be stored in GMT format. It should be possible to present data in PDT or other time format for end users.  To make reporting system scalable, it should be possible to split daily processing between multiple machines.  Regardless of current processing state, an end user should be able to view reports 24x7. A separation between machines in charge of daily processing and in charge of data querying should be considered.  Those 2 types of servers could have different indexes optimized for the type of operations performed. Users who need access to the reports could or could not have access to the corpNet. Today external partners receive their reports via e-mail.  Shall we continue with that delivery mechanism? Shall we setup a web site that our external partners can hit whenever they need the data?  It is extremely hard to send a data feed for 3rd party companies who do not have access to the CorpNet. Do we plan to send data feeds to any 3rd party company in the future? The system should provide 2 types of reports: historical and near-real time. Data set completeness is critical for historical reports. Timing is critical for near-real time reports.  Reporting system upgrade and release schedule should be the same as for the rest of XBL service. However it should be possible to have a separate release schedule. It should be possible to upgrade reporting system without touching core components of XBL service. That means that data collection and processing could be changed without modifying service bits.  All reporting system components should have a failover mechanism. It is unacceptable to stop processing due to h/w failure, etc. It should be possible to monitor daily processing status and statistics. The system should warn about unexpected data pattern change. E.g. suddenly the number of new subscribers that averages at X is 0.01% of X for the current processing day. That might indicate a bug in the system. Proper perf counters should indicate processing rate and volumes. Reporting dev team should implement the solution and not be involved in ongoing maintenance and support issues. Ops should have personal responsible for reporting system maintenance and support. Ops should be involved at the design phase and define tools required to run reporting as any other services. What team is going to develop those tools? One of the tools required is updating static data that comes from sources other than datacenter. An example would be broadband providers IP ranges. Currently, whenever new IP range added, a manual intervention required to update BroadBandProvider and IPRanges tables. Current reporting system has valuable data that should be migrated to the new system.  For what type of reports it is interesting/ necessary to separate Xbox1 from Xe users? What tools/technologies to use for the front end? It should be possible to perform add hoc queries and setup recurrent data feeds for various marketing/financial groups. The system will generate hourly, daily, monthly (fiscal and calendar month), quarterly (fiscal and calendar quarter), annual (fiscal and calendar) and LTD aggregations. Does anybody care about weekly aggregations? Current system complies none of the requirements mentioned above. It cannot scale to the sizes and dimensions required for Xe timeframe. <Add more explanation here about why we cannot continue using existing reporting solution. Short answer is  it won t work How do we deal with reporting schema upgrades or maintenance procedures? How do we make sure that we are not missing data processing during those upgrades?  System capacity and perf requirements Subscribers: Total number of subscribers: 1.8M today, estimated 10M in 5 years Daily new subscribers:   today: 5K-25K for the last month, estimated:  to reach 10M subscribers in 5 years daily increase should average at 4K daily, let s peak it at 50K How often subscribers migrate from one subscription tier to another or perform any action that changes the status of their account?  Let s assume 50K transaction/day for the new users and let say 5% of all existing users (that is 500K) change their subscription status daily. How does the points system add to this equation? XBL service metrics: Daily unique users: today 520K, estimated 4M Daily sessions played: today 2M, estimated 16M Daily users: 4M users play in average 4 games = 16 M daily sessions Peak hours are: 5pm PDT-12am PDT Off peak hours are: 12am-8am PDT.  Current usage ratio between off peak hours and peak hours is 1:5-1:10. That means that in 7 peak hours we should receive a little bit less than 50% of the traffic, that means 7% of daily traffic/hour = ~1.12M/hour = ~350 game sessions/sec. Content download daily: today download 60K, referrals 31K, estimated download 600K/referrals 310K per day.  Data transfer between corpNet and DataCenter.  Design proposed in this document assumes that entire reporting system resides in the datacenter. The biggest open question is how to expose data to the end-user. According to ops team it is not possible to have a middle-tier network that connects between the datacenter and corpNet. We need to find a different solution to that problem. Here are scenarios when data should be retrieved from or push into reporting system. Absence of reliable data exchange mechanism between corpNet and Production will make reporting system unusable. Internal MSFT and external users (TBD) should be able to view various reports  SPG data feed should be transferred from corpNet to Production and imported into reporting system. Frequency: once a week. Estimated size: up to 30G Recurrent data feeds should be retrieved from reporting system and delivered to partners inside and outside of MSFT.  Today s examples include various CIQ  data feeds ( frequency: weekly, estimated size:  700M, from reporting system to a corpNet share), Loc Bui data feed ( frequency: bi-weekly, estimated size: 10G, from reporting system outside of the company),  marketing data feed ( frequency: weekly, estimated size: 20G , from reporting system to a corpNet share) Ad-hoc queries. Run a query on a reporting server, send results to marketing, finance or other groups. Data size and frequency could very.  A copy of the full reporting system should be available in test environment for testing, investigations, etc. Ideally daily, at a minimum weekly Send daily reports to the publishers  Existing reports New reports Financial requirements SPG data feeds Near real time reporting Data collection from XBL service Reporting system relies on numerous sources of information that should be combined, matched and processed together. Sources for reporting data are as following: Production databases.  Full set of databases and tables will be dictated by the features to be implemented. That should be defined in Xe PM spec. Data from the following databases is collected today: UODB, XProfile, WebDB.  For Xe we will need data from UODB, WebDB, catalog DB at least. Reporting server should have access to ConfigDB to retrieve data related to system topology and configuration.  To retrieve data from Production databases the following methods are available (listed in the priority order from best option to worst):  a. Replications b. Log shipping c. Production databases polling Activities tracked by production servers other than databases.  Today we collect servers  application logs from the following servers: Logs: PRES: (logs are copied from tukprpresinhXXX)  Lines including |KIA| only SPS: (logs are copied from tukprxuaciisXXX)  Lines including |CreateAccount| only XBOS: (logs are copied from tukprxbosiisXXX)  |904|CONTENTREF| FDBK: (logs are copied from tukprfdbkiis and tukprmessiisXXX)  Filter out lines including |1481375749| Look for lines including |801|FEEDBACK| CUST: (logs are copied from tukprcustiisXXX) Lines including |MAC| or |RPW| DOWN: (logs are copied from XXXPrDownIISXXX)  IIS logs STFD: ( logs are copied from SeaPrStoriisXXX) Lines including |WRF|0| or |RDF|0| WBCA: (logs are copied from SeaPrWbcaIISXXX)  Collection of applications logs is not a reliable source of information. Currently there is no way to track completeness of collected data set. The logs are at least 2 hours old when they copied to the machine that is in charge of reporting data collection and filtering. Since real time reporting is one of the 3 requirements that should be fulfilled, generated data should be entered into reporting system and processed as fast as possible.  See following section  Collecting data from production servers  for production servers  data collection  Performance counters (not collected today). For real time reports it could be a good source of information. Investigate if it helps or complicates the matter Events fired by production servers will not be collected. Any information contained in events and relevant for reporting should be available through other channels. Number of dependencies makes reporting system very complicated and challenging to maintain. Database includes user ID in XboxLive world and servers have knowledge about that particular user activities on XBL service. Only combination of those 2 sources can give a complete picture of users  activities on the service. Collecting data from production servers: Data should be streamed continuously from production servers to the reporting system.  To prevent additional load on production servers minimal or no processing at all should be performed on production servers themselves. It should be possible to throttle reporting activities on the production servers. Throttling should be configurable and reporting system should be able to deal with partial data.   For data collection from production servers 2 new entities are introduced:  Cleansing service and FilterDB.   EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Cleansing server contains a set of filters. A filter is responsible for cleansing and transforming data uploaded from a production server. Each filter knows how to transform uploaded data generated by a production server into format suitable for reporting. One filter corresponds to one core XBL component the data should be collected from.  Thus if there are 4 presence INH machines, 4 instances of presence filter will exist on the cleansing server.  For cleansing feedback logs, a feedback filter will exist.  A filter receives new data from a core XBL component via TCP/IP. For that purpose we are going to utilize xmgmt infrastructure. A new xmgmt target type called reporting will be defined. Utilizing xmgmt infrastructure gives us a flexible way to push more data to reporting servers without changing core XBL components. Thus if after launch we find out that useful information presents in a trace statement, we just need to associate particular xmgmt area with xmgmt reporting target and additional data will be uploaded into reporting system. Xmgmt reporting target should be able to handle intermittent TCP failures and make sure that all data is safely uploaded to the cleansing server.  Fundamental assumption of this architecture is core XBL service can establish (and maintain) a reliable TCP connection with Cleansing server. Since both machines resides in our datacenter, that assumption should be valid.   Upon receiving new data from core XBL component, the filter applies transform, batches cleansed data in memory and bulk inserts it into corresponding raw tables (aka as Fact tables in OLAP). The number of cleansing servers should be determined based on system load. Multiple cleansing servers can simultaneously filter the data.  Raw (or fact tables are replicated into reporting DB). At that point data is ready for reporting processing. Reporting service runs on the machine where reporting database resides. It peeks up replicated data and manages all necessary processing. Reporting service generates data that an end user can retrieve. Reports themselves could be viewed via web site. Web site for reports will be built using SQL server s reporting service (Rozetta). Investigate other options for front end applications (low priority for Xe launch). Reports will be exposed to internal MSFT employees only. The web site will be ACLed based on IP range of corpNet addresses and end user will need to present his/hers corpNet credentials to access the site. Security policies for that web site should be consistent with other XBL datacenter components of similar nature (e.g. authoring web site for xbox.com).  Open issue: do we want to expose subset of reports to external MSFT partners?. Bandwidth, security complications  Content download servers: Content download servers are pure IIS servers. Currently IIS logs are collected and processed by the reporting system. We do not have control on how IIS generates the logs and how often it rolls them over. ISAPI filter should be implemented.  That filter will intercept a request and will record only necessary data from the http request. We ll use same xmgmt infrastructure to log the data. Thus data collection from content download servers will be identical to the rest of production servers. Content download servers could reside outside of the datacenter. Investigate with ops how to stream the data into reporting servers from content download servers residing outside the datacenter. Xmgmt reporting target Message  opcode Value When the message is sent RPT_CONNECT First message to be sent from core service to cleansing server RPT_DATA Upload data RPT_ALIVE No data to upload, keep alive message for cleansing server to keep track of what data is available so far RPT_DISCONNECT Component stops sending data to the cleansing server. E.g. ops have changed configuration of the component and it uploads data to a different cleansing server or reporting target for the component is disabled RPT_SHUTDOWN Component in the process of  shutting down Cleansing server Cleansing server is in charge of managing data coming from production servers. It handles all servers except of production databases. Cleansing server receives data from a production server, applies transform and filters incoming data, caches data in memory when needed and updates raw tables. Raw tables are replicated to the central location called reporting server.  Cleansing server keeps track of data uploaded by each core XBL components. It alerts if no data has been uploaded for more than configurable time interval by specific filter. Cleansing filter alerts when its  client disconnected. Cleansing filter reject data posted not in chronological order and alerts about data inconsistency. Different filters could have different policies on how much data is kept in memory and how often raw tables are updated.

This document is not intended to be an in-depth look at the Reporting service. For that, please see the service spec at XXX. The spec is in source depot \\depot\xonline\main\private\doc\reporting\ TsunamiReportingSystem.doc. Is there a good place accessible by the XOC team? Service Description Xbox Live s Reporting service is the way we provide information to internal and external audiences on the popularity of the service. Internal teams, such as Account Management, Operations and Marketing, access the internal Reporting web   HYPERLINK "http://xsrptiis01.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/reports/Pages/Folder.aspx"   to see how many users connect to Live during a given period of time. The data at the site can be queried by a large number of parameters. Publishers receive daily emails that give them details on the popularity of their titles, the number of content downloads, or the amount of  bounty  money due to them. Xbox Live is legally bound to provide this information to our business partners through the contracts we sign with them. This makes the Reporting service even more important. Collection of Data from Xbox Live There are two main components of the service   the collection of data from the Production databases and the processing of that information on CorpNet. All data collection is done in the Tukwila data center. At 0700 each day, a SQL job called  Copy and Restore DBs  is automatically executed. This script copies the database backup file from WebDB to the DMG server. Once that copying work is complete, the script restores WebDB. UODB partitions 1-4 and XProfile partitions 1-7 are synchronized with corresponding production servers by using SQL log shipping mechanism and a set of tools developed by MatMak on top of it. After copies of all required databases are available,  Copy and Restore DBs  SQL tasks execute step 6, that is script (UploadOneDay.js). This script performs six important steps: Exports tables from UODB, XProfile and WebDB; Retrieves logs and filters information not needed for Reporting; (LogVault is responsible for transferring the files to the DMG server.) The script checks all necessary log files availability of DMG server prior to collection. The script waits until all logs are available. Filters data from Feedback, Presence, XBOS, SPS and XPNF to avoid transferring irrelevant data; Renames the log files and packs them into one large file with a file name of F:\Reporting\prodscripts\done\<machine name><component name>log<time range>; Zips the log files;Resulting zip files are temporarily placed in 2 following locations: f:\reporting\prodscripts\zips   8 zip files for the logs f:\reporting\prodscripts\dbs   4 database zips files Copies the zipped files to the HST server. f:\reporting\prodscripts\zips\*.zip are copied to e:\xonfud\reporting\download\today on HST f:\reporting\prodscripts\dbs\*.zip are copied to e:\xonfud\reporting\download\dbs on HST The very last file to be copied from f:\reporting\prodscripts\results.txt to e:\xonfud\reporting\download\today on HST.  All zip files from F:\reporting\prodscirpts\zips and f:\reporting\prodscripts\today are deleted after copying to HST The HST server is the staging machine   the link between Xbox Live Production and Microsoft s CorpNet. No processing is done on this server. The last file copied to the HST machine is results.txt. The existence of this file on HST indicates that all log and DB files are collected and ready to go to CorpNet for processing.  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Processing Data on CorpNet Two servers on CorpNet process and display the Reporting data. XsRptData01 is the database server that processes the received information and runs SQL stored procedures. XsRptIIS01 runs the web service that provides a GUI interface to the reports.  At 0600 each day, the script DownloadAndProcessOneDay.js kicks off the processing. It looks for the file results.txt on the HST server, and when it is found the data on the HST server is securely copied to the XsRptData01 server on CorpNet. The full list of downloaded files: Databases: UODB non-partitioned tables in uodbnp-c.zip UODB partitioned tables in uodb-c.zip XProfile tables in profiledb.zip Webdb tables in webdb.zip Logs: PRES: (logs are copied from tukprpresinhXXX)  Lines including |KIA| only SPS: (logs are copied from tukprxuaciisXXX)  Lines including |CreateAccount| only XBOS: (logs are copied from tukprxbosiisXXX)  |904|CONTENTREF| FDBK: (logs are copied from tukprfdbkiis and tukprmessiisXXX)  Filter out lines including |1481375749| Look for lines including |801|FEEDBACK| CUST: (logs are copied from tukprcustiisXXX) Lines including |MAC| or |RPW| DOWN: (logs are copied from XXXPrDownIISXXX)  IIS logs STFD: ( logs are copied from SeaPrStoriisXXX) Lines including |WRF|0| or |RDF|0| WBCA: (logs are copied from SeaPrWbcaIISXXX)  The following actions are performed on XsRptData01: Download database files to e:\reporting\fromprod\reporting\dbs Download logs to e:\reporting\fromprod\reporting\today Count downloaded files. There should be 8 logs zips and results.txt and 4 database zip files. Abort the process if all required files are not present Move all files to e:\reporting\zips Execute UpdateDBS.cmd-import database zips into Xreport3 database Extract log files into e:\Reporting\Transformer\work, remove files that are outside of the processing day boundaries. Every day process uses yesterday and the day before yesterday logs. Execute TandL.cmd that imports log files into Xreport3 Delete e:\Reporting\Transformer\work\* Execute MoveBcps.cmd Execute WorkflowForDateRange.cmd All daily processing activities are logged in e:\reporting\result_<dateTime>.txt file on XsrptData01. That file represents current activities on the reporting server. Daily processing is completed when the end of that file includes the following line  Daily report process complete.  Elapsed time = XXX minutes. Example of Successful Completion An example of successful run would be: 13:44:51:      13:44:51:277:                      Completed: Daily Trials Users Processing 13:44:51:      loop 13:44:51:       ReportingIncomplete  13:44:51:       -------------------  13:44:51:                         0  13:44:51:       13:44:51:       13:44:51:       13:44:51:       13:44:51:   13:44:51:  Daily report process complete.

Alerts, Errors and Actions The following alerts and errors are generated by the Reporting service. These are color coded to help the XOC quickly identify any action they may need to take:  Error that is causing the Reporting service to fail or is impacting users. Follow the directions to alert the developer or fix the issue. Errors in this category have an ID range of 500+. Yellow   an alert that is causing problems but is not causing the Reporting service to fail. Alerts in this category have an ID range of 100-499. Green   Alert that shows successful completion of a task. Alerts in this category have an ID range of 0-99. The absence of these alerts indicates a problem. Alerts Event Text Event Definition XOC Action UploadOneDay.js starting.  Production side processing starting. TukPrInfrDMG01 This event should fire within 15 minutes of scheduled start time. If not, check to see the SQL job exists and has the correct credentials. UploadOneDay.js done. Production side processing completed. TukPrInfrDMG01 This event should fire before 0800. If not, check to see 8 log zips, results.txt and 4 DB zips are located in the upload directory. DownloadAndProcessOneDay.js starting.  Results file =  <full path to file> CorpNet side processing starting. XsrptData01 This event should fire between 0600 and 0615. If not, check to see the scheduled task exists and has the correct credentials. DownloadAndProcessOneDay.js:  Done. CorpNet side processing ended. XsrptData01 Ideally, we could perform an action if this event doesn t fire, but not until we get daily processing more consistent Completed database export. Production side: Completed DB export This event should fire within 30 minutes from scheduled start time. If not, check the databases for possible corruption. Finished downloading files. CorpNet side: Completed file download XsrptData01  This event should fire before 0900. If not, check the download directories for existence of files. If files exist, the connection is slow; if not, the connection does not exist to Production. All logs are ready for collection. Beginning log packaging. Production side: LogVault is ready XsrptData01 This event should fire before 0800. If not, run the stored procedure  p_XR_GetMissingLogNames  in the LogVault DB to determine which files Reporting believes are missing.  Errors Event Text Event Definition XOC Action ERROR: (<errno>) <errname>: <errormsg> Generic script exception Unhandled error. Contact dev. Invalid number of arguments specified. Invalid number of arguments specified. This should not occur unless the script was updated without updating the scheduled task, or the scheduled task was changed. Please specify /date parameter in MM/DD/YYYY format Invalid date format. This should not occur unless the scheduled task was changed. DownloadError: Did not download expected number of files Mismatch in number of files downloaded and expected. Not all files were copied successfully. It could be a disk space problem on DMG or HST box. Check location and existence of zip files There should be 4 database zip files. We don t have the correct number of database zip files. Database export failed. Usually it indicates a problem with SQL log shipping streams. Check log shipping and restore tasks. Go to Query Analyzer and check that UODB1-UODB4 and XProfile1-Xprofile7 are not grayed out (i.e. inaccessible) on TukPrInfrDMG01. Workflow for date range ended unexpectedly. Our main workflow stored procedure has ended with an unexpected result. Contact dev. Monitoring and Actions The three servers in Production that require monitoring from the XOC for Reporting to run correctly are TukInfrPrDMG001, TukInfrPrHST001 and XsRptData01. These are the areas to watch on each of those servers: TukInfrPrDmg001 Monitored Subject Failure Severity XOC Actions SQL job  Copy and restore DBs  till step 7  Log file prep (inclusive) Critical Identify the cause and fix it ASAP. If necessary, contact NatalyP. Free disk space on drives h:, o:, f: Critical Each drive should have at least 20G of free space. If less than that, take steps to reduce file size on the drive or open a bug to get additional space added.

User Impact When the Reporting service doesn t perform as expected: Reports are not sent to external partners (game publishers) as agreed to by contract; The internal Reporting web site (  HYPERLINK "http://xsrptiis01.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/reports/Pages/Folder.aspx"  http://xsrptiis01.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/reports/Pages/Folder.aspx ) does not have information for the latest date; Inaccurate information is used by internal audiences (number of new accounts, downloads and unique users, for example). XOC and development staff are pulled away from other work in order to fight fires and revive the service. Communication & Expectations When a Reporting issue is discovered by the XOC and action is needed to correct it, a Product Studio ticket needs opened to track the work. Once their investigation is complete, they need to send mail to the xonrpt alias or call NatalyP, depending on the situation. If the Reporting team needs the XOC to investigate an issue or perform an action, someone on that team needs to open a bug to track the issue, using the Reporting template. Once the bug is completed, send mail to the xoc alias.  Going forward, the XOC will be responsible for getting Ops War approval for any scripts that need re-executed in the Production environment. For tasks the XOC commonly performs, they will get a bug to track the issue with standing Ops War approval. In the bugs tracking the work, both the XOC and the Reporting dev need to provide a realistic time for resolving the issue. When setting the due date/time in bugs, there are two things to consider: The XOC is responsible for monitoring the entire Xbox Live service. There may be higher priority tasks or emergencies that preclude them from immediately attending to Reporting issues. The reports that go out are important to our business customers and internal audiences. Xbox is contractually obligated to provide game data to publishers. The Reporting team and the XOC will communicate with each other to establish the priority of the work that needs to be completed. Resolution The XOC will know the Reporting service is back to normal when: Data is collected without errors; Data is copied to the HST server without errors; All files are deleted after successful download.  A better indication would be to check e:\reporting\results_<dateTimeStamp>.txt on XsRptData01. A total of 12 files are present on the RPT server on CorpNet - eight logs zips and four database zip files; The processing of the data completes without error; There is a mail sent to xbldaily alias. Does XOC want /need to be on that alias? Updated information is visible via the internal Reporting web site. Any bugs tracking daily process issues are Resolved back to the originator, along with detailed description of the work performed.

Schedule status  Milestone Description In Progress 3/24/2003  Design Initial stab at design for Messenger Integration.  Design Scoping the technologies and procedures required to build the Alerts Service and messenger integration components. The result of this milestone is this document + a working prototype.  Goals Build the XBOX Live community into a vibrant interconnected network of gamers.  Alerts has the following goals: Helps gamers find each other on the XBOX Live service by extending the presence system to the PC via integration with the Instant Messenger client Builds community by allowing gamers to communicate from XBOX Live to the PC via targeted alerts.  Non-Goals Alerts has the following non-goals: Pushing any kind of alerts from the PC back into the XBOX network Scenarios Scenario 1: Setup Alerts: Peter (gamertag: Kestrel) is an avid XBOX live user, but doesn t keep his XBOX online most of the time. He spends most of his time at his PC. He uses Instant Messenger for communication with friends and relatives on the PC. Since he wants to make the most of his XBOX game time, he wants to know when important events happen. He navigates to   HYPERLINK "http://www.xbox.com/alerts"  http://www.xbox.com/alerts  with his browser, and signs up for XBOX alerts. This establishes the link between his passport identity on the web and his gamertag in the XBOX world. Peter can now receive xbox notifications on his PC.  Scenario 2: Basic Presence Alerts: Peter s friend Vince (gamertag: Ecniv) has been taunting Peter about finally holding a higher rank in MotoGP after many months of practice. Kestrel and Ecniv have each other on their friends lists, but rarely bother to setup times to game together. Vince logs onto his XBOX one night to improve his MotoGP scores. Peter is on his PC working, and is logged into Messenger. When Vince logs onto Live with his XBOX, Peter receives an alert through messenger  Ecniv is logged on in MotoGP  This allows Peter the opportunity to stop what he is doing on the PC, and get online with his XBOX to prove his superiority.   Scenario 3: Game Invite Alerts Continuing the scenario above, Peter is actually doing something important on his PC, and decides to not kick Vince s butt right at this moment. Vince, seeing that he has nobody to race against, and being bored with time trials, decides to send Peter a game invite, on the off chance that he might logon while Vince is racing. The game invite is transmitted through the Presence system, and is turned into another alert at Peter s IM client  Ecniv has invited you to play MotoGP  which prompts Peter to stop what he is doing on the PC, and proceed to boot up his XBOX for a quick schooling session.  Architecture Diagram  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Design This is the real meat of the feature spec.  This section is where you detail the design of the feature. The content of this section will depend heavily on the type of spec being written.  If applicable, this is the section that should contain APIs, UI, schema, etc. as needed by the feature in addition to the behavior of the feature. Problem Definition We want to allow XBOX Live services to distribute alerts to consumers using Instant Messenger on their PC with a minimal amount of overhead to existing servers. It is also likely that in the future, alerts will come from various components both inside and potentially outside the XBOX Live network such as editorial alerts or game articles published by the XPlace team. As such, the alerts feature is envisioned as a separate service from any existing XBOX Live service.  Alerts delivery is a less critical piece of the XBOX Live service than core platform features such as presence or stats. As such, it is acceptable for the service to be designed without maximum redundancy. If we lose the ability to deliver alerts for a period of time it is an acceptable outage. Fundamentally, this service will depend on downstream services, so even if the XBOX service is fully redundant, a risk of outages will still exist.  Constraints Must be easy to generate alerts events from various XBOX live services. In the future, the service will likely source events from presence, stats, messaging and other services Alerts must be able to be delivered to Messenger clients Some event sources will need to be extremely performance sensitive (ie. alerts events associated with game invites) and will not be able to afford the overhead associated with a SQL call The XPlace team must be able to host and own the web pages that control user signup and management of alerts New servers should live in the Level 3 datacenter if at all possible, not Tukwilla. Options The most basic option for building an Alerts Service would be to partner with the Messenger team directly to deliver XML formatted alerts to their backend service which would then be represented as messenger toast on the desktop. The xbox service would be completely responsible for alert generation, localization, administration and transport. The Messenger service would only handle delivery. The Messenger team handles this sort of integration with external partners through the .NET Alerts service. Microsoft already has a significant investment in the .NET Alerts system, which provides transport services to various devices, including Messenger. Using the .NET Alerts service for alerts transport would also enable delivery of alerts to email and mobile devices. The .NET Alerts service also allows for central management of users alerts at   HYPERLINK "http://alerts.microsoft.com/Alerts"  http://alerts.microsoft.com/Alerts For alerts generation, Microsoft has SQL Server Notification Services (SQLNS) available as an option. SQLNS is a programming framework for creating applications that generate and send notifications, as well as a platform for hosting those applications. SQLNS sinks events from an external source and takes care of notification generation for the set of subscribers and subscriptions in its system. SQLNS applications are built on top of SQL Server using XML and the .NET Framework to define the application. It is a flexible architecture and allows for plugging in custom code as necessary to expand the core functionality.  The .NET Alerts service and SQLNS are not competing products. One is a notification transport service, and the other is a notification generation platform. They are complimentary and designed to work together. Proposal The XBOX team should build its alerts solution on a single SQL server in the Seattle Level 3 datacenter. This server would utilize both SQLNS as the core application for managing notifications, and would use .NET Alerts as the primary alerts transport.  Using both existing technologies has many benefits over building our own solution from the ground up. They include: Less code to write and test. SQLNS Applications are built primarily with XML and a setup tool. This means we can define the application in XML, and feel fairly confident that the result will behave as expected without a huge test burden testing the internals of the system.  Tool based application generation means we can potentially be more flexible for the XPlace team as they want to introduce new alert subscriptions that don t necessarily align with our major service release schedules.  SQLNS is capable of using .NET Alerts as a notification transport out of the box using their HTTP transport provider and additional code provided by the .NET Alerts team. SQLNS handles many of the hard problems associated with alert generation including localization of notifications by user, and time zone mapping to the subscriber s time zone if desired. Implementation Details There are many parts beyond just the Alerts service to building the overall alerts infrastructure for XBOX Live. The major components that must be build are listed below, and explained in more detail in later sections of this document: The Subscription Management Process Defining Events and Subscriptions Alert Generation at Presence Replication of PUID mapping table from UODB to Profile DBs Basic Notification Services ADF and Config file Title Manager Changes to support Alerts Interfacing with .NET Alerts The Subscription Management Process Before a user can receive alerts, they must sign up for XBOX Live alerts somewhere on the web. This web site would be a Passport integrated website that would be integrated with .NET Alerts. Users that wish to sign up with .NET Alerts would visit the site, sign into passport, and then complete three steps to be successfully signed up for alerts.  First, the users must link their Passport ID to their XBOX gamertag. This work is being covered in another spec. See Van s spec at   HYPERLINK "http://sts/Xbox_Online/Specs/Xbox%20Live%202003%20Web%20Services.doc"  http://sts/Xbox_Online/Specs/Xbox%20Live%202003%20Web%20Services.doc  for more details.  Once the user has linked their Passport ID to their XBOX gamertag, they must provision their passport for Alerts delivery with .NET Alerts. This is done by a redirect on the website to   HYPERLINK "http://alerts.microsoft.com/"  http://alerts.microsoft.com/ . The Alerts SDK provides for the passing of arguments to the signup URL such that when the user is finished that task, they are redirected back to the original website to complete step 3.  The final step that the user must complete is to sign up for the application specific alerts. This page would be hosted by the XPlace team, and would result in a web services call through the Web SG to setup or modify the users alerts subscriptions.  Steps 2 and 3 of this process are prototyped at   HYPERLINK "http://phansen1.dns.microsoft.com/"  http://phansen1.dns.microsoft.com/  in the Passport preproduction environment.  Defining Events And Subscriptions Defining events to generate alerts was an interesting topic to consider given the constraints of the service design. Several different approaches were considered, but after analyzing our network topology, and talking at length with the SQLNS dev team, it was decided that the most efficient mechanism for delivering alert events to the alerts server would be through a custom  non-hosted  provider that lives on the SQLNS box. This provider would be a NT service that would be able to hold a persistent connection to the PRESINH servers, and read UDP packets on the wire and translate them into SQLNS events locally using OLEDB to talk to the SQLNS application.  Why? Talking SQL directly from the PRESINH boxes would add additional load to the presence service in the logon code path, which is already critical path. Also, the PRESINH boxes are in the Tukwilla datacenter, and the Alerts service will be in Level 3. That means that communication between those services will be via the cross datacenter VPN, and should be bandwidth limited as much as possible. Using UDP over a custom connection also means that the alert data can be sent asynchronously, and can be treated as  fire and forget . If we drop a packet along the way, then a notification will not be generated to send to the .NET Alerts cloud. Not a big deal.  Presence already is proficient at holding open persistent TCP connections between the various machines that make up the presence service, so one more for Alerts is a straightforward code change.  The service at the alerts side can also make use of the extensive service and networking classes built to support other live services.  The next big question was to answer what exactly an alert packet consists of. Since we have complete control of the protocol, we can perform additional optimizations. One of the key considerations as to what is included in the alert packet is what data is available at the Alerts service. In order to minimize data integrity issues caused by replication of the friends list, it was decided to not replicate friends list state from the Profile DB to the Alerts service. Doing so would have required extensive changes to Presence to include message generation whenever a users  friends list is updated. It would inevitably lead to data being out of sync between the two services, with no easy way to fix that problem. Instead, the Presence servers will do the list expansion of a users  friends list when they log on. This work is done anyway to populate the Alive cache internally to Presence. The alerts event will then contain the gamertag of the user that logged on, the titleid they logged on to, and the web PUID of the friend that will receive the alert. These events would be generated for every user that has associated their XBOX with a web PUID. The Alerts service takes care of figuring out which of those users is actually signed up to receive alerts on their messenger client, and will discard the unnecessary ones.  Logon Event: Parameter Name Description Friend Web PUID QWORD Friends Passport PUID Sender Title Id DWORD Title Id the sender user is in Sender gamertag Up to 32 Bytes Null terminated Gamertag string of the sender At the Alerts service, each user would  subscribe  to live alerts via the XPlace website, and corresponding subscription calls through the Web SG to the Alerts service. Once subscribed, the user would have data persisted in the Alerts service including their Web PUID, timezone, and language ID they want alerts received in. This data about the subscriber would be relevant for all alert subscriptions the user signs up for (as the service is extended to include game invite alerts, content alerts, etc) Alert Generation at Presence This discussion focuses on presence live alerts: For users who are signed up for alerts, we want to have those users receive a notification whenever one of their friends logs onto their XBOX. This is a core function of the Presence servers. A chief difference for the live alerts is that they would be sent to each of a user s friends, regardless of their current online state, as they may otherwise have no presence in the XBOX system.  The wire protocol for sending logon events to the Alerts Service contains must encapsulate the data described in the logon events in section 9.2. There is only one message defined in the alerts wire protocol in v1: FriendAlert. The message is variable length, governed by the number of friends listed, and the senders gamertag length.  Presence Alert: Parameter Name Description Sender Title Id DWORD Title Id the sender user is in Alert Type Flags Alert Flags (currently unused) cReceipients Number of Recipients Sender Chars Count of Chars in SenderName Data Chars Count of WChars in Data Sender XUID QWORD Senders User ID Receipient Web PUID QWORD* Recipient Passport PUID per Recipient Recipient XUID QWORD* Receipient User ID per Receipient Up to 255 WCHARs No Reply This message encapsulates the data for generating logon events for all the users friends when a user logs on. This allows us to minimize packets to the Alerts Service, and keep bandwidth usage to a minimum. The message can be easily broken down at the Alerts Service side into the corresponding N events before being inserted into the SQLNS application.  The Presence Alert message is sufficiently generic to be reused for new event types in the future, for example, when events relating to game invites, messages, or other presence specific alerts are supported. It is envisioned that each of these additional event types would simply use a new Alert Type value in the protocol, and that these Alert Types would map to different alert subscriptions in the Alerts Service.  Replication of PUID mapping table from UODB to Profile DBs One of the fundamental challenges to solve in order to support the FriendAlert messages is to ensure that the Web PUIDs are available at the Presence service in an efficient manner. We know that we need to lookup the destination user s Web PUID at some point in the event generation process, and having this data available in Presence would be the most efficient use of bandwidth, since it would allow us to discard friends that have not linked their XBOX PUID to a passport PUID at the source, rather than later in the process.  Since a users  PUID mapping changes very rarely, we can simply write the users Web PUID mapping into the Profile DB the same way we denormalize gamertag names for friend lookups. This means that at the time a user links their XBOX PUID to a Passport PUID, we perform a cluster scan across the Profile DB and write the updated mapping in every friends list that user appears in.  The UODB will still contain the  master  copy of users XBOX to Passport mappings, so that if we ever have data integrity issues between the database clusters due to hardware failure, etc. we can recover the correct state from UODB. If a user experiences weird behavior due to mismatched PUIDs in their Profile DB, they can correct the problem by re-linking their accounts via the XPlace UI.  We may need some PSS tools to help lookup a users PUID mapping in the Profile DB and verify consistency across the database. This should be the same set of tools we use to verify gamertag consistency (which I believe doesn t currently exist in any tool) Title Manager Changes to support Alerts The last piece of data required to be able to generate alerts is a mapping between Title ID and title names. Again, this is infrequently changing data, but we do not want this mapping at the Presence Service, since that would mean including the title name in the logon event messages.  Title names are managed through Title Manager, and it is simple to have Title Manager maintain the up to date version of the names in the Alerts Service directly through OLEDB calls to stored procedures on that box. The data will be stored internally in the Alerts Service in a  chronicle table  which is a fancy term for persistent application data. The data will be used when generating alerts from events to map between the title id in the event to the title name in the alert.  Basic Notification Services ADF and Config file Now that we have the basic changes to Presence defined, and the wire protocol for sourcing events defined, it is time to consider what the SQLNS application looks like on the Alerts Service itself. SQLNS is configured entirely through two XML files: a config file and an Application Definition File (ADF) The following are the basic config and ADF file required for the Alerts Service, as defined for the prototype application.

That delivery channel will be unused in the production application.  The ADF file is by far the more interesting file of the two. It defines the events and subscriptions, and how alerts (called notifications by SQLNS) are generated.

  <QuantumDuration>PT15S</QuantumDuration>         <PerformanceQueryInterval>PT5S</PerformanceQueryInterval>     </ApplicationExecutionSettings> </Application> The ADF file defines three different event classes. The first is for the chronicle table that stores the mapping between title ids and title names. It creates a chronicle table for storing the data, and defines an event by which title name mappings can be created or inserted. This is the mechanism that title manager uses to keep the title data current. This table also needs to be initialized with data when the application is first created. The data is stored in SQL server, so it persists across restarts and reboots.  The second event class is the one defining live events. These define how events sent from Presence are stored in the SQLNS application. These events will also be inserted by the Alerts NT service that will reside locally on the SQLNS box called XEvents, consuming the custom Alert messages from Presence, and generating OLEDB calls to SQL SPs to insert events.   The third event class defines content alerts, which are simpler than the live events, and envisioned to be inserted into the system by producers of xbox.com. These messages will alert users to new games, levels, and any other type of content information that is deemed to be relevant to the alerts system.  The subscription class describes the events that users can subscribe to. In this case, there is only one subscription class covering logon events. A user that subscribes will store their locale and device information as part of their subscription, and the subscription also defines how events are converted into notifications via the EventRule element.  The notification class describes what data comprises the alerts, how they are formatted, and how they are delivered. It defines an XSLT used to transform the notification XML into the actual Alert text as part of the ContentFormatter aggregate. The notification class also defines the notifications to be delivered via the MSAlerts protocol, and the additional fields required for that protocol to be used.  Finally, the ADF file defines the event providers used in the system. This section is not strictly necessary, as both event sources are calling SQL SPs directly, however this section defines a non-hosted provider for documentation purposes.  Interfacing with .NET Alerts One of the topics glossed over in the above description of the SQLNS application is the interface with .NET Alerts. The config file and ADF file both refer to the MSALERTS HTTP provider, but there are no additional details of how this provider is actually implemented.  The .NET Alerts team has implemented a custom alerts protocol based on the build in HTTP Protocol provided as part of the SQLNS solution. The new protocol is written in C#, and exposed via the Microsoft.Alerts.NotificationServices.AlertsDeliveryProtocol.dll assembly. Future Alerts  The discussion in section 9 focused on logon and messaging alerts. There is no doubt that new features will cause there to be the need for additional alert types and subscriptions in the future. There will be two types of alert types added to the SQLNS application External Alerts The first of this type of alerts is what the XPlace team is referring to as their content alerts. These alerts will form a new alerts subscription in the SQLNS application, and will subscribed to separately from live alerts through the front end UI on the xbox.com website. The events for this type of external alerts will be most likely generated via an internal tool that a producer or similar can run at their desktop to create notifications for the service. Adding new external alerts should not require any code changes to core XBOX Live services. They should be completely supported via changes to the SQLNS config file and ADF file, and rebuilding the SQLNS application. It is conceivable that the operations team could undertake this kind of change out of band from the Live teams normal release cycle.  Core Service Alerts The other type of alerts will be service generated alerts similar to live alerts where the events are generated by other XBOX Live services. This includes features like alerts tied to messaging, teams, tournaments, or other new features. Supporting these alerts will likely mean code changes in the services that are sourcing the events, and potentially protocol changes and changes to the Alerts service that runs on the SQLNS machine in addition to the config and ADF file changes. These types of alerts will be tied to the Live teams release schedules due to the impact across the network.  Security This section should cover potential security issues and how these will be addressed.  This section should consider at a minimum the threat groupings (STRIDE) put together by the Secure Windows Initiative team.  For more information on security, see the SWI team web site at   HYPERLINK "http://swiweb"  http://swiweb .  The STRIDE groupings are detailed in the sections below: Spoofing Identity An example of user identity spoofing is the breaching of a user's authentication information. In this case, the hacker has obtained the user's personal information or something that enables him or her to replay the authentication procedure. Spoofing threats are usually associated with a wily hacker being able to impersonate a valid system user or resource to get access to the system and thereby compromise system security. Tampering with Data Tampering with data involves the malicious modification of system or user data with or without detection. An unauthorized change made to stored or in-transit information, the formatting of a hard disk, the introduction by a malicious intruder of an undetectable network packet in a communication, and an undetectable change made to a sensitive file are all examples of tampering threats Repudiability  Repudiability threats are associated with users malicious or otherwise who can deny performing an action without administrators having any way to prove otherwise. An example of a repudiability threat is a user performing an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace such operations. Information Disclosure Information disclosure threats involve the compromising of private or business-critical information through the exposure of that information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user's ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to and an intruder's ability to read data in transit between two computers are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that in this case the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to appear as a legitimate user. Denial of Service (DoS) Denial of service (DoS) threats when carried out deny service to valid users for example, by making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable or by forcing a reboot or restart of the user's machine. You must protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability. Other types of DoS threats, however, are very hard to protect against; at a minimum, you should identify and rationalize such threats. Elevation of Privilege In this type of threat, an unprivileged user gains privileged access and thereby has sufficient access to compromise or destroy the entire system. The more dangerous aspect of such threats is the compromising of the system in undetectable ways whereby the user can take advantage of privileges without the knowledge of system administrators. Elevation of privilege threats include those situations in which an attacker has effectively penetrated all system defenses and become part of the trusted system itself at that point, the attacker can cause extreme system damage. Operations This section is owned by an Operations Program Manager, but is written as a team effort by all members of the component team   PM, Dev, Test, & Ops. Events This section details all events that may be written to any of the OS event logs   primarily but not constrained to the System, Application, and Security logs. Events must be written at any point where a response is necessary from an resource external to the component.  Events are the triggers for actions   corrective or preventative, machine or human.  If an event does not directly trigger an action, consideration should be given as to whether there is a better way to provide the information. Events should contain enough information to be reasonably intuitive.  Events that do not utilize the description field are not intuitive. Event List: Event ID Source Category Description 50100 Information The Xbox KDC has started. Text Logging This section details the items that will be written to the text logs. Text logs are used as a record of interactions with Xboxes and other components of the Xbox Online service.  The text logs will be utilized for a number of purposes, including debugging and data mining. Text logs are not processed in real-time, therefore they cannot be used to trigger corrective or preventative action.  If that is necessary, an event should be written to the event log. Sample Text Log: #Xbox Online Log Version 1.0 #Date: 01-01-2002 09:00:00 #Logged By: server,servicename 00:00:01,10.1.1.1,xbox_id,player_id,match,game,gamemode,result Performance Counters This section details all performance counters that will be exposed by the component. Performance counters serve several purposes: Real-time monitoring Baselining and capacity planning Any item worthwhile of a performance counter should likely have more than one counter.  For instance, a Matchmaking server will have a counter for  Active Matchmaking Sessions .  Logical siblings would be  Average Active Matchmaking Sessions  and  Peak Active Matchmaking Sessions All APIs that affect eventing, text logging, or performance monitoring should be detailed here.  Examples include: SetTextLoggingMode(mode) Where mode = Default, Verbose, Debug ConsolidateEvents(event,duration) Where event = Event we want to consolidate to avoid log flooding And duration = how long consolidation should remain in effect Interactions All interactions with other components of the Xbox Online service should be called out here.  This includes the following: Other components that rely on this component Components that are relied upon by this component In each case, the effect of a failed interaction should be described. Usability Issues Call out issues that need to be determined by usability or other testing. External use This section should cover if/how the feature can be hosted, supported, or maintained by third parties.  For example, can a game publisher host their own content download servers and if so   How? What technologies are required?  Do we give then code? Etc. Dependencies If needed:  This section should cover any Internal / External dependencies that the feature has.  This section should also address schedule issues with the dependencies. International If needed:  This section should detail any considerations that should be made for International (all non-English Languages). This could include detailing encoding of data on the wire, how strings are stored in the databases, considerations for UI, Legal, etc. Terms Terms required in the TCRs, Required UI and Recommended Practices will be in  Terminology.doc User Interface What UI elements will have to pass through localization. Technical Certification Requirements This section should outline all client and server certification requirements imposed by the feature. Required UI This section should outline all Required UI that the game developer will have to follow. Policy Any policy decisions should be here. Recommended Practices This section should outline the recommended practices that are not TCRs or Required UI, but still nice to consider. Samples Each sample in the XDK should be described here. Any parts of the feature that are cut from the spec should be moved to this section for consideration in future releases.

M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals M1 Milestone:   Rerunning existing tests against the Xevents in-house server will validate that there has been no behavior change in the server since the previous release.  The new test cases developed with validate the proper integration of the configuration database technology into the alerts server for loading and changing configuration settings. M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals M1 Milestone:   Stress is not a goal for this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents Xbox Live Alerts (Dev Spec) ($private\doc\server\alerts\Alerts.doc) Functional Testing Summary The Alerts server uses an in-house server named Xevents to process UDP packets send from both the notification and presence servers.  Xevents then puts these events into a SQL Notifications Services (SQLNS) system for processing.  If a user has a subscription for the alert being generated that alert is formatted into the proper language and handed of the MSN Alerts Service for delivery.  Content alerts will be injected directly into SQLNS for processing.  Subscriptions for alert types are setup by an Xbox.com web interface and the Alerts Widget.  Testing will focus around the Xevents service as the point of entry for most test cases and SQLNS as the point of entry for content alerts and title string population.  The test methodology will be to have the generated alerts be handed off for delivery back to the test application vs. the MSN Alerts service.  Once the test application receives the alerts, they will be validated against what was expected. Test Case Matrix New Test Cases per Milestone Functional Configuration Database Test Cases M1 Milestone:  P_ConfigDB_Initialize_Setting_Port Using the management commands, verify that the port setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. P_ConfigDB_Initialize_Setting_Buffers Using the management commands, verify that the buffers setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. P_ConfigDB_Initialize_Setting_Threads Using the management commands, verify that the threads setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. P_ConfigDB_Initialize_Setting_Alerts Using the management commands, verify that the alerts setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. P_ConfigDB_Reconfigure_Setting_Port Using the management commands, snapshot the current port setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take affect.

It will present more technical details about the implementation of the arbitration feature. Information in the previous two documents will not be repeated here and thus readers are assumed to have read those two documents first. Eventually, information from this document will be integrated into those documents. Architecture The arbitration server service consists of a stateless front door tier and a stateful INH tier.     The front door is a simple IIS application written in C#.  It s primary purpose is to forward requests to the appropriate INH box based on the session id.  It supports 4 different APIs using 4 different URLs: /XArb/Register.ashx: All clients must individually register to be in a session before it can do anything else in the session. The arbitration server retrieves the auth data of the users (and thus the TRF) at this point in time. /XArb/TimeExtend.ashx: This is used to extend the play time of the session if needed. /XArb/ReportResult.ashx: This is the final communication to the arbitration server to report the results of the session (from each client s perspective). /XArb/DebugResult.ashx: This is used for debugging on TestNet to examine the current state of the session. The INH arbitration servers is an in are memory stateful servers,  (similar to presence, but hosted by IIS ) and written in C#. It supports 4 different APIs using 4 different URLs: /XArb/Register.ashx: All clients must individually register to be in a session before it can do anything else in the session. The arbitration server retrieves the auth data of the users (and thus the TRF) at this point in time. /XArb/TimeExtend.ashx: This is used to extend the play time of the session if needed. /XArb/ReportResult.ashx: This is the final communication to the arbitration server to report the results of the session (from each client s perspective). /XArb/DebugResult.ashx: This is used for debugging on TestNet to examine the current state of the session.    It supports the same list of URL as the front door. Each client individually registers with the arbitration server for all APIs. The arbitration server records everybody s impression of what happened at the end of the session and then determines and submits the final arbitrated stats and competition bundles to the stats and query service respectively. Then the arbitration server updates all participants trust rating factor based on its interpretation of what happened in the session. The submitted trust rating changes are batched up to decrease traffic to UODB (which holds the TRF). The KDC places the TRF in the auth data portion of the Kerberos ticket such that it can be used by any backend service. For scalability reasons, we must support multiple arbitration INH servers. But since the state of each arbitrated session is maintained in memory, all clients in the same session must always talk to the same arbitration server.  This load balancing is performed by partitioning sessions into buckets The SG can do this load balancing for us if we make the arbitration client talk to different arbitration service ports based on the value of (SessionID mod 120) and forwarding incoming requests to the server associated with each bucket. The SG can then further decide which one of the N Arbitration servers to send the request to based on the value of the port mod N. Section 5 discusses this in more detail. The UDP Adaptor is a separate NT service that lives on the Arbitration servers and listens at the same port as the IIS server except it listens for UDP packets. It converts the UDP requests to an HTTP Post on the local front door and turns the HTTP response back to a UDP reply packet. Trust Rating Factor Many numbers are recorded per user per title: SuccessfulSessionCount (C1): The number of normal successful arbitrated sessions this user played in for this title, where a majority quorum agreed on the session results. MinoritySessionCount (C2): The number of abnormal but successful arbitrated sessions this user played in for this title, where no majority quorum agreed on the session results, but a minority quorum did agree. FailedSessionCount (C3): The number of failed arbitrated sessions this user played in for this title, where not even a minority quorum agreed on the results. ProblematicSessionCount (C4): The number of times this particular user registered in a session in which some user in the session reported lost connectivity during the game session. Any user in the session reporting connectivity problems will result in all users in the session getting this counter incremented. UDPReportCount (C5): The number of times this particular user registered in a session in which some user need to send their session report in UDP. Any user reporting in UDP will result in all users in the session getting this counter incremented. This typically implies that some user in the session is packet flooding the victim. DisconnectCount (C6): The number of times this particular user registered in a session but never reported results for that session later. A  Disconnect  only affects the user that didn t report; all other users are unaffected (except for the fact that the session might become a Non Majority or failed Session due to many missing reports). Type1SuspicioustCount (C7): The number of times this particular user registered in a session that had type 1 suspicious activity reported in the game session. Type2SuspicioustCount (C8): The number of times this particular user registered in a session that had type 1 suspicious activity reported in the game session. Type3SuspicioustCount (C9): The number of times this particular user registered in a session that had type 1 suspicious activity reported in the game session. i_TotalSessions: The un-weighted un-decayed integer number of times this particular user registered in a session. i_TotalSessionDisconnects: The un-weighted un-decayed integer number of times this particular user registered in a session by failed to report results or voluntarily quit the session. i_TotalCompetitions: The un-weighted un-decayed integer number of times this particular user was involved (or suppose to be involved) in a competition session. This number is incremented by either the arbitration server (when an actual competition session is played), or the query server (when the user or it s opponent never showed up). i_TotalCompetitionNoShows: The un-weighted un-decayed integer number of times this particular user never showed up for a competition session. This number is incremented only by the query server (when the user never showed up for a competition session). i_SessionBase: The sum of this number for all users of a particular title will reveal how many total arbitrated sessions were played for this title. The individual numbers do NOT reveal anything meaningful about the particular user. i_SessionXboxCount: The sum of this number for all users of a particular title will reveal the sum of all the non-unique number of Xboxes in all sessions for this title. The individual numbers do NOT reveal anything meaningful about the particular user. The sum of this number divided by the sum of i_SessionBase will reveal the average number of Xboxes that play in an arbitrated game session. i_SessionSeconds: The sum of this number for all users of a particular title will reveal the sum of all the played seconds in all sessions for this title. The individual numbers do NOT reveal anything meaningful about the particular user. The sum of this number divided by the sum of i_SessionBase will reveal the average number of seconds in an arbitrated game session for each title. i_SessionFreeForAll: The sum of this number for all users of a particular title will reveal how many total free for all arbitrated sessions were played for this title. The individual numbers do NOT reveal anything meaningful about the particular user. The sum of this number divided by the sum of i_SessionBase will reveal the ratio of free for all arbitrated game sessions. Note that for each session, exactly one of four counters C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 will get incremented. C6, C7, C8, and C9 are independent counters that will get independently get incremented if the situation happens. Also, C6 is the only counter that can be modified for specific users. All other counters are either modified for all users in the session, or not at all for all users in the session. We want to decay the value of these counters such that what happens recently is more important than what happen in the past. This means that along with our counters C1 through C9, we will store a timestamp T. The effective counter value at time Tnow is: C * Decay(Tnow - T) Any stored procedure that needs to use these counter values should use the above formula to compute C. Each time we need to modify the counter value by delta we compute: C = C * Decay(Tnow - T) + Delta T = Tnow The Decay function should probably be: Decay(DeltaT) = Exp(-( DeltaT / Lambda )) With Lambda being a positive constant that kind-of represents the "Half-Life" of how fast the decaying happens. When Lambda amount of time passes, the value of V decays to (1/e) of its original value (where e = 2.7128 ). The default value for Lambda would be 3 months. Besides the decay described above, all C value increments are amplified by the TrustModificationFactor before the arbitration server makes the stored procedure call to change the C values. The TrustModificationFactor that all counters are modified by is a weight that is logarithmically proportional to the length of the game session. The value is: TrustModificationFactor = 1.0 + Math.Log ( Math.Max ( 1.0 , sessionSeconds / i_BaseSessionTime ) ) Note that this value will be 1 for all sessions that are shorter than i BaseSessionTime (default is 2 minutes), and grow logarithmically with the length of the game session. The length of the game session is defined as the time the session was created to the time of the first report submission. In addition to the above TrustModificationFactor , we also multiply the counter modification by a  User Competition Amplification  factor (say 2) or a  Publisher Competition Amplification  (say 4) factor when the game is a tournament session. A user s trust rating factory (TRF) will be positively influenced by the C1 counter and negatively influenced by all the other counters. The ratio of how much each negative counter will influence the TRF will be adjusted based how large the summation of that counter is for all users for that title. The ratio will be represented by the numbers R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 and will be re-computed on a daily basis. The Preliminary TRF (PTRF) will be computed using the following formula (this will be the value stored in the Kerberos ticket auth data): PTRF = C1   (R2 * C2 + R3 * C3 + R4 * C4 + R5 * C5 + R6 * C6 + R7 * C7 + R8 * C8 + R9 * C9) The Ri values are a weight modification factor that gets updated daily using the formula: WSUM = W2 + W3 + W4 + W5 + W6 + W7 + W8 + W9 Ri = (Wi * S1) / (WSUM * Si) Wi represents a weighting factor associated with each negative counter to advise us on how heavy to weigh that particular negative activity. Typically, the Wi values are always 1.0 for all negative activity except for custom suspicious info. Si is the sum of Ci for all users for that title. The value of all Ri is chosen such that the sum of PTRF for all users is 0. Note that the Ri values are also chosen such that the more people that get involved in a negative activity, the less penalty is applied for that particular negative activity. The final TRF number for each user is computed on the arbitration server using the following formula: TRF = B + ( 1 / (1 + exp( - PTRF/ K ) ) ) B is the  BaseUserTrust  that rewards you a basic trust factor for simply being a user. B will be configurable on a per title basis. As an example, when B is 1, every users TRF value will be between 1 and 2. This will make it such that we place more trust on 2 very untrustworthy users compared to one very trustworthy user. K is the constant that determines the slope of the Fermi function used in computing TRF. K will be adjusted daily to be: K = S1 / TotalNumberOfUsers Each Xbox gets a TRF value of the average TRF value for all users playing on that Xbox. Arbitration is performed using Xboxes as units of arbitration. The arbitration server will simply compute the sum of all TRF values for all Xboxes in a session and a majority quorum is simply a set of Xboxes where the sum of the TRF for the Xboxes is greater that 50% of the total TRF. A minority quorum is simply a set of Xboxes where the sum of the TRF for the Xboxes is less than or equal to 50% but greater than MinorityQuorum Percentage (say 25%) of the total TRF. The arbitration servers will update the Si, Ri, K, and other summation values every 24 hours for all titles. The new values will get stored back into t_title_trust_constants.  UODB Database Schema The following table is created in UODB to store information needed to compute the TRF for each user for each title. The table is partitioned on bi_user_puid.     create table t_user_trust_ratings     (         bi_user_puid                         bigint    not null,         i_title_id                           int       not null,         f_C1_SuccessfulSessionCount          real      not null default(0),         f_C2_MinoritySessionCount            real      not null default(0),         f_C3_FailedSessionCount              real      not null default(0),         f_C4_ProblematicSessionCount         real      not null default(0),         f_C5_UDPReportSessionCount           real      not null default(0),         f_C6_DisconnectCount                 real      not null default(0),         f_C7_Type1SuspiciousCount            real      not null default(0),         f_C8_Type2SuspiciousCount            real      not null default(0),         f_C9_Type3SuspiciousCount            real      not null default(0),         i_TotalSessions                      int       not null default(0),         i_TotalSessionDisconnects            int       not null default(0),         i_TotalCompetitions                  int       not null default(0),         i_TotalCompetitionNoShows            int       not null default(0),         i_SessionBase                        int       not null default(0),         i_SessionXboxCount                   int       not null default(0),         i_SessionSeconds                     int       not null default(0),         i_SessionFreeForAll                  int       not null default(0),         constraint pk_user_trust_ratings primary key (             bi_user_puid,         i_title_id         ),         constraint fk_UserTrustRatings_Users foreign key (             bi_user_puid                     ) references dbo.t_users (             bi_user_puid                     ) not for replication,                  constraint fk_UserTrustRatings_Titles foreign key (             i_title_id                     ) references dbo.t_titles (             i_title_id                     ) not for replication,                  -- WEBSTORE                 si_hash_bucket                       smallint  not null default(0),          dt_Change_datetime                   datetime  not null default(getutcdate()),     ) The following table is created in UODB to store the constants needed to compute TRF for each title.

However, the (TitleID,SessionID,SessionNonce) 20 byte triplet is what is used to uniquely identify an arbitrated session. From the arbitration servers perspective, two sessions with the same SessionID but a different nonce is considered to be completely different sessions. The reason to load balance solely on SessionID is to keep users that play many rounds in the same match session locked on the same arbitration server such that the UODB TRF updates can be batched together more efficiently. Arbitration Logic During the arbitration of a session, there are two commit points. The first commit point is when the stats and tournament bundle to be forwarded to the stats and query front door has been determined and submitted. This commit point will be reached if either: A majority quorum reports the same bundle submission ((The session has timed out) or (all clients have reported results)) and (the bundle that the most (in terms of accumulated TRF) clients agree to satisfy the minority quorum percentage). The second commit point is when everybody s trust rating will be updated. This happens when either one of the two conditions below becomes true: The session has timed out All clients that registered have reported results For the purpose of updating user trust, each session can end with one of the following 4 results: Problematic: If one of the following conditions is true: More than one bundle was submitted for the session At least 1 client reported in UDP At least 1 client reported losing connectivity with another client that did report results Normal: If the session is not problematic and a majority quorum reports the same bundle. Minority: If the session is neither problematic nor normal, and a minority quorum exists for a bundle. Failed: If none of the above is true. Note that a problematic session might still have a majority bundle determined and submitted to the corresponding front doors even though the session is considered problematic. A session times out when the maximum time of all the following times for all clients it finally reached: Client registration call time + MaxSessionSeconds specified in registration + SessionTimeoutExtensionSeconds Client Time Extension call time + MaxSessionSecondsFromNow specified in time extend request + SessionTimeoutExtensionSeconds If a session reaches the second commit point earlier due to all clients reporting results, the above timeout is ignored and the session is left around for an additional TrailingReportRetriesWaitSeconds to enable trailing report retries to still locate this session and not generate a  Session Not Found  error. Wire Protocol In the following wire protocol description, the PUID of an Xbox is used in many places. Xbox PUIDs are not exposed to title developers directly but the XNADDR (which contains the Xbox PUID) of an Xbox is exposed. The arbitration client APIs will most likely accept XNADDRs in the API, but only send the Xbox PUID on the wire. The following data will be sent for an arbitration Registration request (The number in parenthesis is the byte count): ProtocolVersion (2): Will be 1 initially. RequestFlags (2): The following values are defined: 0x0001: Is tournament 0x0002: Time can be extended 0x0004: Session Host used to forward packets 0x0008: Team Membership info included 0x0010: Session is a free for all session 0x0020: Session is a publisher tournament TitleID (4): The title ID of the game being played. SessionID (8): The random session ID handed out by matchmaking SessionNonce (8): A random nonce generated by the match host to uniquely represent this particular arbitrated game round within this session ID. MaxSessionSeconds (2): This time should include any lingering timeout period at the end of the session. The arbitration server will only accept ReportResult request up to MaxSessionSeconds + SessionTimeoutExtensionSeconds from the time of the last user registration. SessionTimeoutExtensionSeconds is typically 60 seconds and is configured in the server ini file. The maximum value that can be specified for MaxSessionSeconds is 3600 (1 hour), the client should check this and assert if value is larger than 3600. NumberOfTeamTickets (1): This and everything after it is only present if team membership info included FirstTeamTicketSizeInBytes (2) FirstTeamTicket (FirstTeamTicketSizeInBytes): This is the signature server signed ticket that contains proof of which Teams a user is a membership of. LastTeamTicketSizeInBytes (2) LastTeamTicket (LastTeamTicketSizeInBytes): This is the signature server signed ticket that contains proof of which Teams a user is a membership of. The team tickets will only be submitted if the session is played on behalf of team statistics or is a team competition. Also, only team tickets for users on the current client will be submitted. The following data will be returned by the arbitration Registration request: NumberOfXboxesThatRegisteredForThisSession (2) PUIDOfFirstXboxThatRegisteredForThisSession (8) TrustworthynessOfFirstXbox(1): Number between 0 to 255 with the least trustworthy Xbox shifted to 0 NumberOfUsersOnFirstXbox (1) XUIDOfFirstUserOnFirstXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfSecondUserOnFirstXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfLastUserOnFirstXbox (8+4=12) PUIDOfSecondXboxThatRegisteredForThisSession (8) TrustworthynessOfSecondXbox(1) NumberOfUsersOnSecondXbox (1) XUIDOfFirstUserOnSecondXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfSecondUserOnSecondXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfLastUserOnSecondXbox (8+4=12) PUIDOfLastXboxThatRegisteredForThisSession (8): This should be the PUID of the current Xbox making the registration call, unless this Xbox has already registered earlier and is re-registering again. TrustworthynessOfLastXbox(1) NumberOfUsersOnLastXbox (1) XUIDOfFirstUserOnLastXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfSecondUserOnLastXbox (8+4=12) XUIDOfLastUserOnLastXbox (8+4=12) The following data will be sent for an arbitration TimeExtension request: ProtocolVersion (2): Will be 1 initially. RequestFlags (2): The following values are defined: TitleID (4): The title ID of the game being played. SessionID (8) SessionNonce (8) MaxSessionSecondsFromNow (2) The following data will be returned by the arbitration TimeExtension request: None. An HTTP response will still be sent to acknowledge the receipt of the report, but no response data will be in the HTTP response body. An X-Err HTTP header line will be placed in the response header if an error occurred. The following data will be sent for an arbitration ReportResult request: ProtocolVersion (2): Will be 1 initially. RequestFlags (2): The following values are defined: 0x8000: I voluntarily quit from this game, I ll take disconnect penalty and I m willing to accept stats submission from other players. I can t submit any bundle info myself. The reason I m sending this report is to tell the server about the bad things (like custom suspicious info) that happened in this game. 0x4000: I was a session host during the game 0x2000: I lost connectivity to some peers during game play 0x1000: Lost connectivity info submitted 0x0800: Type 1 suspicious info submitted 0x0400: Type 2 suspicious info submitted  0x0200: Type 3 suspicious info submitted 0x0100: Stats bundle info submitted 0x0080: Tournament bundle info submitted TitleID (4): The title ID of the game being played.

TournamentBundle (TournamentBundleByteCount): Only present if bundle submitted and Tournament bit was on. The following data will be returned by the arbitration ReportResult request: None. An HTTP response will still be sent to acknowledge the receipt of the report, but no response data will be in the HTTP response body. An X-Err HTTP header line will be placed in the response header if an error occurred. But, submitting a non accepted bundle is NOT considered an error. The client will NOT be informed about whether their bundle is accepted or not. If the client needs to switch to sending the ReportResult request in UDP due to failures in sending with TCP, some data might need to be removed from the report to make the request fit in a UDP packet. When such a need arises, the order of removal should be: Remove Stats and Tournament bundle (they must both be either in or out together) Remove Type 3 suspicious info Remove Type 2 suspicious info Remove Type 1 suspicious info Remove Lost connectivity info The corresponding bits in the flags will need to be updated correspondingly. The wire protocol between the arbitration server and the stats server and query service is basically a simple HTTP post request where the arbitrated bundle submitted by the clients is sent in the POST payload. The response to the POST is thrown away and ignored by arbitration. The arbitration server will include a new HTTP header line called  BundledAuthData  in the post request. This auth data will contain a base64 encoded blob of information that describes the list of authenticated users that participated in the game session. It is up to the stats server and query server to use this information to verify that users involved in the stats/tournament bundle really did play in the session. Another optional HTTP header line called  TeamTickets  will exist if the client submitted Team membership tickets during registration. Again, it is up to the stats/query service to verify and use this info if the submitted bundle involves team statistics and team competitions. A 4th API exist for the sole purpose of debugging the state of a session. The API is  DebugResult  and has the following wire protocol:     public enum ArbitrationSessionOutcome { Undetermined, Successful, Minority, Failed, Problematic }     public class ArbitrationXUIDAndTrust : WireData     {         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong qwUserID;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public uint dwUserFlags;         public float userTrust;     }     public class ArbitrationBundle : WireData     {         public int index;         public uint count;         public double totalTrust;     }     public class ArbitrationXboxInfo : WireData     {         public byte timeExtendCount;         public byte reportCount;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ushort reportFlags;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong xboxID;         public int userCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="userCount")]                 public ArbitrationXUIDAndTrust[] users;         public double trust;         public byte normalizedTrust;         public int bundleIndex;         public int diconnectedXboxCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="diconnectedXboxCount", HexString=true)]                 public ulong[] diconnectedXboxes;     }     public class ArbitrationSuspiciousInfo : WireData     {         public int type; // 1, 2, or 3         public string message;         public int xboxCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="xboxCount", HexString=true)]                 public ulong[] xboxes;         public int userCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="userCount", HexString=true)]                 public ulong[] users;     }     public class ArbitrationTitleParameters : WireData     {         public double BaseTrust; // Base trust rewarded per Xbox         public double MinorityQuorum;         public double UserTournamentAmplification;         public double PublisherTournamentAmplification;         public uint BaseSessionTime;         public double FermiK; // Constant in Fermi function     }     //     // Request for DebugResult     //     public class ArbitrationDebugResultRequest : XRLObject2     {         public ushort version;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ushort flags;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public uint titleID;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong sessionID;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong sessionNonce;     }     //     // Response from DebugResult request     //     public class ArbitrationDebugResultResponse : XRLObject2     {         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public uint titleID;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong sessionID;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ulong sessionNonce;         public ArbitrationTitleParameters titleParameters;         [WireInfo(HexString=true)]         public ushort flags;         public ushort maxSessionSeconds;         public DateTime startTime;         public double sessionSeconds;                  public int xboxCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="xboxCount")]                 public ArbitrationXboxInfo[] xboxes;         public int teamTicketCount;                  public double totalTrust;         public uint reportCount;         public bool arbitrated;                  public int result; // ArbitrationSessionOutcome         public int nonProblematicResult; // ArbitrationSessionOutcome         public float trustModificationScale;         public int bundleCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="bundleCount")]                 public ArbitrationBundle[] bundles;         public int submittedBundleIndex;                  public int suspiciousInfoCount;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="suspiciousInfoCount")]                 public ArbitrationSuspiciousInfo[] suspiciousInfo;     } The flags field in the request is not used. The response contains detailed information about the session at this point in time. This API call must be made before the session times out or within TrailingReportRetriesWaitSeconds from the time all Xboxes in the session report results. The configuration parameter  EnableDebugResult  defaults to no and can be used to enable this API. The server fires an event at startup time if this feature is enabled. This feature should only be enabled in testnet.

But since the state of each arbitrated session is maintained in memory, all clients in the same session must always talk to the same arbitration server. This load balancing can be achieved using the SG in the following manneris achieved by the stateless Arbitration front doors, using the bucket table stored in ConfigDB. For the Register API, the Front Door first sends the request to the active server (specified in the vc_server column in ConfigDB..t_buckets).  If this server returns status code 301 (Moved) and the vc_next_server column is not blank or the same server, the front door then forwards the request to this next server.    For all other APIs on the front door, each request is forwarded to both servers specified in vc_server and vc_next_server (if different).   Only one is expected to respond with status code 200; if both, or neither server, responds with 200, an event is logged and an error is returned to the client. On the INH arbitration server, when the Register API is called, the server first determines if this is the appropriate server to handle the request.   This is performed by first determining the bucket associated with the session id, then checking if an existing session exists in memory; if so, the INH box is already hosting this session, and returns 200. Otherwise, the server checks the vc_server configuration for the session bucket.   If the server specified is the localhost, and dt_next_server_start is in the future, the server hosts the new session and returns 200.   Otherwise, 301 is returned. If the local INH server is the one specified in dt_next_server_start, the Register request is assumed to be at it s proper destination (irrespective of dt_next_server_start), and the new session is created. For all other APIs on the INH box, if the session id exists in memory, the request is handled as usual.  Otherwise, 301 is returned.  : Assume the KDC issues port P as the port the client should talk to in order to reach arbitration. The client should actually communicate with port  P + ( SessionID mod 120 )  when talking to the arbitration server for that particular session. Assuming that we have 3 arbitration servers in our datacenter. The sgconfig.ini file will be written such that: Ports P through P+39 are directed to the first arbitration server. Ports P+40 through P+79 are directed to the second arbitration server. Ports P+80 through P+119 are directed to the third arbitration server. Each arbitration server will be configured to bind to 40 different ports. And the SG will be configured to map each of the client incoming ports to one of the arbitration server ports. Different arbitration server ports are needed because the SG needs to know which client port to send the response back to when the arbitration server sends response packets. Even though this example uses 3 arbitration servers, we should be able to easily change the number of servers we load balance to on the server side as long as the number is divisible by 120. The number 120 was chosen for this specific reason since it has lots of factors. UDP Adaptor Service In thinking about the problems encountered by the arbitration server, the following problem came up. If 8 people play in a game and at the end of the game 7 users report consistent results and claim that the 8th user disconnected in the middle of the game, and the 8th user never reported anything to the arbitration server. What do we know? Can we really believe that it is a simply case of that one user powering off the box in the middle of the game? We must realize that there is the possibility that it could be one of the other 7 players packet bombing the 8th player (probably because he was leading) to the point that he couldn t even report the fact that he is having connectivity problems to the arbitration server. However, it seems pretty obvious that this will be a very common case, and the fact that we can t discriminate between a user that has simply powered off his box, versus a user that is being packet bombed, is very discouraging. In the simple disconnect case, the remaining 7 players would get positive trust modification and the disconnected user would get negative trust modification. In the connectivity problem case, all 8 players would probably get a negative trust modification. If only we could tell the difference between these two cases! Thinking about the problem some more, you realize that the packet bomber can only chew up the victims  downstream  bandwidth, but cannot touch the victim s upstream bandwidth (to be verified by Eric). However, due to the fact that we use HTTP to communicate to the arbitration server, a TCP connection must be established to even POST information up to the server. In a packet bomb scenario, the SYN packet will probably make it to the server, but the SYNACK will have a hard time making its way back down to the client, and thus the TCP connection will never get established and the POST to the arbitration server will never get through. If only the client could tell the arbitration server the true story of what is happening using ONE upstream UDP packet! Enter the UDP to HTTP Adaptor! The fundamental idea of the UDP adaptor is the following: We write a simple server that listens on UDP port 80 (or whatever port the HTTP front door is listening on) and accepts UDP packets coming from the SG, upon receiving the UDP packet; it transforms the payload into an HTTP POST onto the IIS server running on the local machine through TCP port 80. The IIS server handles the request like normal and sends back a response. Upon receiving the HTTP response, the UDP adaptor packages the response into another UDP packet and sends the response packet back through the SG to the client. Notice that we just compressed the entire HTTP connection, payload transfer, and teardown, down to just one UDP round trip packet. Using this UDP adaptor would require absolutely no change whatsoever on the SG. Only the client would need to be changed, and the exact same UDP adaptor can be placed on any IIS front door machine we wish to optimize using this scheme. We do however; have a few restrictions and things to look out for: This can only be used when both the request and the response packet fits within a single UDP packet. We will need to add some header information in front of both incoming and outgoing UDP packets to convey the information that was originally contained in the HTTP headers (e.g. URL, HRESULT, etc The client will need to perform retries when it doesn t receive the UDP response packets. In the case of packet bombing, the response will never be received, and the client will give up after a certain number of retries, but at least the server got the upstream packet (which is what was important in the arbitration case). The nature of the original HTTP POST request must be idempotent. This means that if the request is repeated multiple times, the same result is obtained, and nothing bad happens. All requests to the arbitration server as well as all requests to the signature server satisfy this criteria. For example, a password reset request to the UACS server would not be idempotent. The UDP adaptor will add a new HTTP Header line  SGIPPort  to the outbound HTTP header to inform the target HTTP server of where the   SG is if it wants to ask the SG for auth data. The UDP adaptor will also add an extra  AdaptedFromUDP  HTTP header line to inform the target that the request was converted from UDP, in case it needs to know for some reason. On the client side, we could simply write an XOnlineUploadFromMemoryUsingUDP function that is used in exactly the same way as XOnlineUploadFromMemory, but uses UDP to achieve the goal. The current plan is to always use UDP for TimeExtend calls to the arbitration server, but always use regular HTTP for Register calls. ReportResult calls will be attempted in HTTP first, but if it fails then the client will fall back to using UDP. ReportResult arbitration requests could be larger than what fits in a UDP packet if the bundles are included and large enough. The client will need to specially handle this case to remove the bundles from the payload (while setting the  Bundle info omitted to fit in UDP  flag) if the request does not fit in UDP packet. If this still doesn t make the packet small enough, then the list of Xboxes in which connectivity was lost can be omitted also (with the correspond bit in the flags turned on). This will guarantee that some arbitration report will reach the arbitration server as long as the user still has upstream connectivity to our data center. Microsoft Confidential.

In order to gather this revenue, we must provide a simple and quick way to initiate and utilize billing relationships with consumers, in a way that is secure, friendly, intuitive and unobtrusive.     The intent of this document is to describe a design to support the billing and authorization functionality required by the XBox Online service, its publishing partners and the user s machines.   It covers user signup, the creation of passport and billing accounts and purchasing subscriptions and content.   This document is intended to describe the design of the system to support this functionality; however, since a functional spec does not yet exist, the assumed functionality is described where necessary to aide in understanding the design approach.   Additionally, Wwhile it may suggest user interface at times, it s understood this UI will also be spec d and developed separately.     Goals XBox billing and authorization is designed with the following goals: Easy   It should be brain-dead simple for the user to sign up for the XBox Online service and to make purchases.   The dashboard and public APIs should be designed to make this experience simple for the title developers to provide. Secure   To be successful, users will have to trust our service and any titles that use our service.  It should ensure the user s information is only accessible by the intended audience.  This includes making it easy for title developers to get it right. Addictive   It should be a simple decision to subscribe, and a difficult decision (emotionally) to unsubscribe.     This means providing the functionality to enable up-selling to premium content, ample advertisement opportunity, and the ability to save a subscription when the user thinks they want to cancel. Enabling   It should be easy enough for title developers to implement quickly but powerful enough to enable creative scenarios. Profitable   Ultimately, it s why we re in this business.   The same policy that achieves the above goals should also bring in as much money as possible, while keeping expenses to a minimum, for both us and our publishing partners. Non-Goals Billing and Authorization system has the following non-goals: Scenarios The following section describes the primary scenarios for billing and authentication. Basic subscription signup Joe has mastered Outlaw Golf, and wants to start showing off his putting prowess with real players online.   He selects the  Find an opponent  option in the game s main menu.   This is his first time going online with his XBox, so he goes through the account signup wizard, where he enters his name, address, credit card info and agrees to some standard terms and conditions.   He then selects the level of XOnline subscription he wishes to sign up for.   He chooses the basic, which includes matchmaking.     After completing the signup wizard, his xbox resets back into the game, and he s shown a list of opponents that closely match his skills.     Basic + Title subscription signup Jane receives Asheron s Car for her birthday.  She s thrilled, as it s the latest and greatest thing in online gaming for the XBox.   She opens the case and starts up her XBox with the game in the tray.   The game detects she doesn t yet have an online account, so it s rebooted to the account signup wizard in the dash.    She proceeds through the wizard, entering the requested information, and in addition to selecting the  XBox Basic Subscription , she also signs up for the  Asheron s Car Mercedes Subscription  option.    After completing signup, the game is reloaded, and she soon finds herself racing against Lugians through the streets of Dereth.    Multiple features on one service EA has integrated online play into their NFL and NHL titles.     They offer a basic subscription for $5.95/month, which gives you access to one of the two titles.   They also offer a premium package for their devoted sports fans, which gives access to both titles at a discounted rate of $7.95/month.    Their infrastructure is built as a single cluster of front-end servers that serves all of their games.  This reduces operational complexities and helps them scale, however, security is controlled by a single shared key.    Thus, they depend on extra data about the user accessing the service to differentiate between subscription levels.  This is provided through the  service parameter  concept. Content extension purchase John has been playing Unreal for weeks now, and has mastered all the levels included with the game.     He finds himself at the familiar map selection menu, however instead of selecting one of the normal maps, he notices another more interesting looking map available for a small fee.   Fortunately, he quite familiar with this whole online thing, and has even convinced his wife (who owns the billing account) to give him a $20/month spending limit.  The $4.95 price tag is well within his range, so he selects the map, confirms he wishes to purchase it, and the charge is added to his next statement (and deducted from his monthly allocation). Over time, John downloads numerous other content packages for the many titles he owns, filling up his drive several times over.   For nostalgia sake, he decides to pick up one of his favorite tracks he downloaded from the content ref. service.   He selects the track within the title, waits a few seconds for it to download, and is off and playing again in no time. Subscription cancellations Jack wants to reduce his monthly expenses.   He goes to the dash and decides to unsubscribe to his entire online account, which includes subscriptions to several games.   The dash walks him through canceling each game, however, when he goes to unsubscribe to Asheron s Car, the game shows a movie reminding him of what a wonderful world he s leaving and how he ll be even less popular with the girls if he stops playing.     He gives in and decides to cancel his magazine subscription to GQ instead.provides him with a 1-900 number he can call to get his subscription cancelled.   He calls this and reaches a friendly Xbox Service Representative, which then entices him with a free month and a few downloads to give the xbox online service another try.  Jack is convinced, and decides to stick around.  Definitions and acronyms XBox Online (XO) Service (XOS):  The service built by the XBox Online team.  Includes matchmaking, buddy lists, billing, content download, authc and authz functionality, etc. Authentication (authc): Ensuring a user, machine or server really is who it claims to be.    Authorization (authz): ensuring a user or machine has the rights necessary to do what they re requesting. Service: specific functionality provided by a given site.    XBox Online services include matchmaking, buddy lists, and the content referral service.  Site: a collection of front-end servers that handles incoming requests for one or more services.  Typically a publisher will have a single site to service all of its services.   Sites have a single shared secret with the XBox TGS for issuing tickets. Subscription: A set of services a user is given access to.   A subscription is the smallest entity in which a user may control their access; for instance, a  basic subscription  could include the matchmaking and buddy list services.    The user can unsubscribe to the basic subscription, and thus both services, but not an individual service.  DealOffer: The terms under which a user is offered signup to one or more subscriptions and/or content packages.  For instance,  Pay $15.95/month for MSN Broadband and a basic subscription to XBox Online , or  Sign up now for premium service and get a free tony hawk download.     An instantiation of a deal offer results in one or more a subscriptions for a user. User DRM: rights managed on a per-user basis.  Only the authenticated user for whom the rights exist is able to use a given piece of functionality. (Example: managing a user s buddy list.) Machine DRM: rights managed on a per-machine basis.    That is to say, all users on that machine have rights to machine-drm d functionality.  (Example: access to a downloaded track on the machine s hard drive.) Provisioning: the act of allocating an account to a user Policy: the logic that dictates the access a user s has with their subscription XName: A name selected by the user to identify themselves to the XO community.   In the format of nickname@zone. Overview The billing and authentication architecture consists of 6 major components; the database, the billing provider, the front-end servers, XBOX client APIs, Service APIs and the PC Face.   The relationship between these components can be viewed as follows:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   Figure   SEQ Figure \* ARABIC  : Conceptual component relationship The database stores authorization information, such as available subscription SKUs, the list of titles with online functionality, users of XOS, subscription information, etc.   Much of this data is used for policy enforcement, for instance, what services can be used with a gold subscription or a list of existing nicknames to avoid duplication.   Other information stored is more for redundancy and lookup speed, i.e. a user s subscription level and status could be queried from the billing partner, but since this would be accessed frequently and (relatively) seldom change, we store it in our own database as well. The billing provider handles the actual billing, resolving charges against a customer s account, collecting funds, etc.    Our current billing system target is MSNIA 2.x.     We notify them, via SOAP calls, of new account creation, subscriptions, removal of subscriptions, and any one-time charges (if/when they add support for these).     They notify us of accounts closed due to external forces (such as failure to collect, cancellation via call to billing provider, etc.).   We use these notifications to update the copy of user information stored in the local database.   Need to define uptime goals for functionality.   For instance, if the external billing system is down, should we still be able to add/remove subscriptions?   Create new accounts?  Authorize?   (I currently assume yes to authorize, no to everything else Information this database is accessed via stored procedures by the front-end servers.  The stored procedures and code on these servers is where the majority of business logic and policy management is implemented.   The technology here will likely be a combination of C# and C++ COM objects, as determined by performance, complexity and maintainability needs.   These front-end servers are stateless; all persistent state is maintained in the database, billing provider or other external service (i.e. reporting). User XBOXes will access the billing service front-end servers via XRLs.    All client/server communication is abstracted from the dashboard or client libraries via a set of APIs; this allows the client to intelligently handle caching and security without exposing these complexities to the title developers, but also means that many of the client APIs which may do round-trips to the server or access the hard drive must be executed asynchronously.   In such cases, the XOnlineTask*() work pump APIs are used.  Other services may need to communicate with the billing service directly on the back-end.   Local service-to-service communication will take place via COM.   Remote service communication will take place via SOAP calls over https.    Would a  client  wrapper around the SOAP interfaces be useful/necessary?  Finally, a PC Face is provided for management of title accounts by the publishers, xbox accounts by the users, and the tools necessary for providing customer support.   These interfaces will be in HTML generated using ASPX and encrypted using SSL for security.    These will be authenticated by the traditional passport manager available today.  Should we consider NTLM or a more secure authentication method for CSRs and/or publishers?

Replicated User_names The list of xnames already in use by existing users.   Should match the list of nicknames in users, however listed separately to facilitate fast name-based lookups. Partitioned on zone, nickname forbidden_names Names disallowed in any zone. Replicated public_zones Zones available to everyone.  Replicated User accounts User accounts are the central point of access for an XBox.   Each account is associated with a user PUID and a billing account PUID, an XName, and possibly one or more subscriptions.   Accounts are created exclusively via the dash, so the title developer need not worry about the details of how to create an account, simply weather or not the current user has an account.  If, from within the title, user wishes to create a new account, the title reboots into the account creation section of the dashboard to do so. User account information is stored in both the client xbox/mu, and the user account database.  In general, all necessary information to authenticate a user is stored on the client box; the information stored in the users database is mainly used for billing, account status, and restoring user accounts in case of a refurbishment or lost credentials (see Restoring accounts below).  Account Creation Accounts will be created through a series of XRL calls made from the dashboard.  The entire process of creating an account is committed in 4 phases   creating an XName, a passport, associating with a billable account, and adding subscriptions.   The phases may or may not be presented in this order to the user; it s possible, for instance, the user may select the desired subscription before creating a passport.   In these cases, the client simply retains the information collected in memory or on the hard drive until the appropriate phase.  Each of these phases of is individually transactional, however the entire process is not rolled back if one single phase fails or is otherwise not completed.    In these cases, the completed phases are still persisted, and the user may return to complete the process from where they left off, at a later time.     Thus, for example, it is entirely possible to have a user account with no billable account, or a billable account with no subscriptions.   Authorization on paid services will simply fail until all phases of account creation are completed successfully.  Machine accounts Before a xbox can go online with user accounts, it must have a machine account.  This machine account creation is described in detail in the   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Security/Specs/Xbox-Passport%20Online%20Authentication%20Protocol.doc"  XBox-Passport Online Authentication Protocol spec Xbox Machine Account Creation spec.  Once this account is created, it s used to authenticate and encrypt the data used against the user account creation service.   This document assumes this process has successfully completed before any user account can be created.  Finding an XName A user creates an XName by entering their name of choice, and specifying a zone.   The list of available zones is specified in the zones table.  Since this is a restricted list, presumably shown in a listbox-type UI, the dashboard must first gather the list of available zones via an XRL call to /uaccts/Zones with the language lcid of the user.   This returns a list of publicly available zones from the public_zones table.   This list could potentially be cached on the client for a limited period of time as a performance optimization. The user is then allowed to enter in the name of their choice, and select a zone.  This information is submitted to /uaccts/CreateXName.   To ensure a valid XName, we check the forbidden_names table for any matching substrings, and check the user_names table for any matching name/zone entries that have already been reserved.  If the requested XName fails either of these checks, the following steps take place to generate the requested number of suggestions: If requested name wasn t found in forbidden_names, check user_names table for existing entries with the same name combined with randomly selected zones, until the requested # of alternate zones is found, or all other zones are checked.   If requested name wasn t in forbidden_names, find up to half of alternate names desired by joining requested name with random entries in adjective_suggestions table.   Find remainder of alternate name entries by joining randomly suggested entries from adjective_suggestions table with randomly selected entries from name_suggestions table. Potential performance optimizations include pre-generating the list of suggestions, or pre-shuffling the name and adjective suggestion lists.  Each step is filtered against the user_names table to remove existing entries; however, nothing is done to prevent a given name from being suggested to more than one person at a time.   Therefore, it s possible (although highly unlikely) two users would choose same suggestion, in which case the first person to choose the suggestion wins, and the other is given additional suggestions.   This process is repeated until a name is found that passes both the forbidden names and existing user name checks.  When this happens, the name is entered into the user_names table to prevent anyone else from reserving this name.   In addition, if the user s puid is specified in the request, the corresponding entry in the users table is updated with the selected name/zone.   A success result is then returned to the client. Need a consistent way of returning result codes and/or error strings to the client.  Passport Registration When the user enters the passport registration phase of account creation, they are first asked if they have an existing passport.  If they indicate they do, they re given the opportunity to enter the user name and password.     This information is submitted to /uaccts/PPExists for verification, which uses the  member-exists  interface of passport manger to verify the user name/password are valid credentials.   If they are, PUID given by passport is encrypted (to prevent tampering) and returned in the response.   Next, we prompt for any required information necessary to create their xbox passport.  Currently this is limited to the user s age.   This information, along with the XName selected by the user, the encrypted PUID returned by PPExists (if applicable), the machine ID, and the user s locale as set in the language section of the dash, is submitted to /uaccts/CreatePPAcct.    This XRL uses passport s delegated admin to create an account using the format,  name@zone.xbox.com .    Once the account is created, the returned PUID is added to the users table with the machine account id, the nickname, the user s language locale, and 0s for the acct_puid, representing no account is set up yet.    In all normal circumstances, this system of creating and reserving an xname up front should ensure the account   HYPERLINK "mailto:name@zone.xbox.com"  name@zone.xbox.com t already exist.   However, this depends on our list of users being in sync with passport s; if, somehow, these got out of sync, or a malicious user modified the name being requested, DA will fail accordingly, and we log the error and add the user to our user_names table.   The client should take the user back to the XName selection screen, notifying the user the account already exists. Upon a successful return from CreatePPAcct, the user s credentials are encrypted using the session key and transferred to the client box, where they are persisted along with the user selected PIN, if any.   Billing account creation Once the user s PUID has been determined, the billing account can be created.    The first thing the dash should do when entering this phase is query for an existing billing account with the user s puid and account PIN (if applicable), via /uaccts/GetBillingInfo.   The users table is queried for acct_puid associated with the user s puid, and if the acct_pin matches, the billing information associated with the acct_puid is retrieved from the external billing system and returned to the client xbox for display. Should the acct_pin be stored & compared on the hard drive before (or in lieu of) the server check?  How would wallet play into this?  Should the same XRL query wallet if no info exists in billing system? s worthwhile to note, when this information is retrieved from the external billing partner, there may already be an account and subscriptions associated with it.   For instance, if a user purchases an MSNIA deal that includes an XBOX Online subscription, the billing system will already have knowledge of that user, and the fact they have an XO subscription to activate.    This information is used to populate the user_subscriptions table with a subscription_status indicating the subscription needs to be activated.   It s then communicated to the client in the GetBillingInfo response, and the client should present the appropriate UI notify the user of this free subscription.  Activation happens when the user subscribes (see below), and they simply are charged according to the special offering. In any case, the client xbox displays the billing information (if any) or a blank slate where the user can enter in their billing information.   All of the required information, including CC#, name on cc, address, the PIN used to protect the account (if any), etc. is sent to /uaccts/UpdateBIllingInfo.   The server submits this info to the external billing system for the current user s PUID.    TODO: fill in the exact list of required data.   What happens if the user already has a billing account in external system, but wishes to allocate a new account for their XO subscription?  Do we prompt for update vs. create new, always assume create new, or..? Submitting billing information to the external billing system is a relatively time-consuming process, as it verifies the account is valid, open and in good standing with the charge-card company or clearing house.   As such, when the client submits updated billing information to UpdateBillingInfo, it will keep the connection open until a final status ( success failed ) is communicated; in the meantime, the service will respond with a  pending  status to test the client is still alive and to notify the client the server is still working on getting status. Once a response is received form the external billing system, users.acct_status_id is updated with the new billing status and a corresponding response is sent to the client. Family accounts Family accounts are accounts which group together several users under a  bundle deal , which provides a discounted rate for each additional user.   The pricing plan is mainly handled by the billing system; however, we require a way to track this in our own database, for several reasons: The billing account associated with a user might be accessed under a different puid than that user Billing information, and the ability to add/remove charges from that bill, might be controlled by a user other than the user associated with the billing account.  Updates to the status of that billable account (i.e. closed by a user or clearance by the billing system is declined) should be reflected with a users associated with that user account.  To achieve these goals, for each user we track a billable puid (stored as acct_puid in the users table), which is the PUID of the first user to have set up the billable account.   Note it is not a requirement that this be an active user; for instance, a user could sign them self up, then several other users, and then cancel their own account.   The acct_puid would still be that of the original user.  The only requirement around this is the puid is consistent between all users on the account, and it be the puid that is used to access the external billing system. When a user edits the billing information within the dashboard, they re offered the option to protect this account with a PIN (stored as the acct_pin in the users table).  This is a PIN similar to the one used to access a user account, however it may be a different code.   The idea behind this is to allow a parent to control access to this billing account using a pin only they know.  The user may still access his own account, however any activity that views or updates the billing account   adding/removing users, adding/removing subscriptions, one time charges, etc   will require the acct_pin be entered.   When editing billing information, if a user subscribes to a family type account, the user is given the opportunity to add additional users to the account.     They can either select from existing users, or create new ones.   The exact UI is TBD; however, once a user is selected to associate with the account, the dash can call /uaccts/UpdateBillingInfo, with the user puid and acct_puid to update the user s billing account to.  Banned accounts Banned accounts are tracked and handled by the external billing system.  If we detect abuse, we can submit this account for banning.  Any future attempts to use the credit card associated with the banned account will then fail. Restoring accounts If a box goes through refurbishment, or the user purchases a new box, the user needs some way of transferring the existing user to the new box.    We re currently considering 3 methods of doing this: Have the user inform us they wish to restore an existing account is by entering in their former XName, their credit card, and billing information via some fork in the UI.    How this UI is accessed is TBD   it could be a menu item during the signup process, or a controller key combination which brings them into the UI.  In either case, the necessary information is collected and sent to /uaccts/RestoreAcct.  This XRL will look up the PUID of the specified XName in user_names, find the acct_puid in the users table for this puid, get the billing information from the external billing system for this puid, and verify the match.   Have the user call customer support.   Once the user s account is verified over the phone, they set up an entry in a TBD table which indicates the user s account is available for restoration, via some key.   The CSR then communicates this key back to the user plus a controller combination to get to the appropriate UI.    The user enters in this key, and it s submitted to the XRL above for verification. Have the user call customer support.  Once the user s account is verified, the CSR asks the user for the box serial #.   An entry is made in a TBD table with the user s accounts, and the serial #.   When the machine goes online, the new accounts are sent down.   In any case, if everything checks out, a new set of credentials is created for the user and saved in passport via DA, and sent back to the client.   Any temporary information set up by the CSR is then removed from the appropriate tables. TODO: find the right solution.   Need to balance the expense of CSR calls with security and ease-of-use.  Offers & Subscriptions Once one or more user accounts have been established on an Xbox, the user is permitted to purchase one or more offerings.   Offerings are really a catch-all phrase for something that may be purchased or acquired   access to a service, a piece of content, vouchers, or an entry into a tournament.   A subscription is an instantiation of an offering for a user, that gives a user temporary or permanent access to a service, piece of content, or tournament.   The offering may have conditions associated with it, i.e. up to 4 players in matchmaking with the basic offering, or up to 16 with the premium.      These conditions are stored as attribute name/values pairs, which are mapped to an individual offering via the offer_attributes table.    Enumerating available offerings To gather a list of subscriptions available, the title or dashboard calls XOnlineEnumerateOfferings() with the title id and the type of offerings requested.   This API calls the XRL /uaccts/EnumOfferings, which responds with the list of offering_ids, names, descriptions and price for the deals offered during or after the start_date and before the end_date of the offerings for title id as listed in title_offerings.      The offerings listed are those applicable to the current user, based on their current subscription status and the data listed in offering_relations table.   There are 5 types of relations: Base: Initial offerings a user may purchase without previous subscription requirements. Upgrade: represents additional benefits, usually at a higher rate.   A purchase of this offering replaces the offering being upgraded. Downgrade: represents a loss of functionality, usually at a cheaper rate.  For instance, the user can downgrade from the premium to a basic offering; doing so will limit him to playing 3 games with matchmaking, instead of 5.  A purchase of this offering replaces the offering being downgraded. Renewal: allows the user to renew their offering, say, to extend the end_date. Add-On: Allows the user to purchase an additional service based on the currently own service.   For instance, subscribing to the basic service may make the user eligible for purchasing additional content.   If the user currently isn t a subscriber (no entries for the current user and title in user_subscriptions, with the start_date <= current date <= end_date), only the   offerings are returned.   If the user is a subscriber, then the non-base offerings are returned.   Could cache this list on the client as a performance optimization. May need to fire an event to allow modification of the offering list by a custom component.   However, doing so would make the aforementioned caching optimization very difficult, if not impossible.  Purchasing offerings  A title, or the dashboard, can purchase an offering via a call to the API XOnlinePurchaseOffering(), passing the offering_id of the deal to be purchased.   The title or dash must collect and verify the acct_pin before doing so, if one exists.   XOnlinePurchaseOffering() evokes the XRL /uaccts/PurchaseOffering.  This method goes through several steps on the server, including a pre and post events to support custom purchase functionality.  (i.e. enforce purchasing rules) Verify the offering_id really exists in the deals table Look up the acct_puid of the current user Fire the server event PreOfferingPurchase() to support custom purchase or authroziat Notify the billing system of the deal purchase for the acct_puid and wait for approval  Add an entry mapping the offer_id to the user_id in user_subscriptions.   Start_date is set to the current date, end_date is set to the term of the subscription (end of month, year, etc) or to MAX_DATE if it s a permanent purchase. Fire the server event PostOfferingPurchase() Notify the client of the result. Vouchers Vouchers support the ability to provide incentives for users to sign up for the xbox online service, or to try out some new feature or content.   They will most commonly be distributed with game titles, however they may also go out as gifts with other hard-goods (i.e. the gamevoice controller, or taco bell happy meals), or may be distributed as  gift cards , which are pre-produced in a set increment ($5, $10, $20, $50) and sold over the counter at a game store.        In all cases, the voucher is generated with a unique key. For version 1, the ID will be a code the user must enter into the dashboard (or in title   pri2), similar to the PID entered in when installing Microsoft software.   In future versions, the key may be written to the BCA area of a title dvd, thus allowing the user to cash in a voucher included with the DVD without having to enter in the code. In order to track and audit the distribution of these keys, when the voucher is produced, the key on the voucher is generated using some TBD algorithm and entered into the vouchers_outstanding table.  Then, when a user enters in the voucher key through the dash or title, it is submitted to /uaccts/PurchaseOffering.    The voucher key is queried in the vouchers_outstanding table, and if a match exists, the following steps take place: voucher_status_id  in vouchers_outstanding is updated to  pending Any policy surrounding the voucher type is then enforced (i.e. limit one per customer).     purchase  of this offering is submitted to the external billing system.  The corresponding entry is added to the vouchers_spent table and removed from the vouchers_outstanding table and, with the user s puid, the date and amount.    A response is sent back to the client with the coupon amount and an indicator of the action taken.    If any one of these steps fails (i.e. the external billing system fails to apply the credit), the voucher_status_id is reverted back to  outstanding  and the error code/message is sent back to the client. How do we detect brute force attempts to crack voucher keys, and handle abusers? Canceling offerings A title or the dash may cancel a user s subscription to an offering by calling XOnlineCancelOffering(), with the corresponding offer_id.    This calls the XRL /uaccts/CancelOffering, which notifies the external billing system of the cancellation, and then updates the end_date of the user_offerings table to the current date, or the end of month, depending on the policy of the offering.     Canceling may not be applicable to some offerings; for instance, purchased content may not be refundable and therefore not cancelable; these offerings are flagged with the  cancelable  flag to false, and any attempt to cancel the offering results in an error is returned to the client.  It might help our retention #s if we provide a mechanism for  saving  users, i.e. when they attempt to cancel, provide them with some final text and/or imagery to entice them to stay.   Priority? Closing accounts A user never really  closes  an account; they simply unsubscribe to offerings.   Credentials remain on the client, and are used if they need to do things like re-download previously purchased content.   Is this accurate? Do we need to provide a mechanism for deleting accounts?    Authorization Authorization is the act of verifying if a user can access a protected feature.  There are two tiers of authorization:  service authorization, and attribute authorization.    Service authorization gives a user access to a site, i.e. the matchmaking or catref servers.   It s expected to be the most common type of authorization, thus authorization against services is performed automatically with XOnlineLogon().     Parameter authorization Sometimes, however, it s desirable to offer provides authorization of functionality on a more granular basis.   , fProperties are of a given service; a title or another service must make a separate API call to verify a user s subscription includes the functionality (parameter) of interest.or instance, subscribers to one offering may only be able to play with up to 4 players, whereas another offering offers up to 16.   It s for these scenarios that attribute authorization is designed; a title, the dash, or a 3rd party game server can call a separate API to discover exactly what conditions are placed on a given offering. The purchase of an offering can include one or more services and/or properties.     These indicate exactly what type of access a user has to the services included in his subscription, based on his purchases.    XOnlineLogon(), and authentication in general, is documented separately.  Need to figure out how guests fit in to all this.  Service-level authorization As noted above, service authorization happens as a part of XOnlineLogon().    This API call includes the user(s) attempting to log in, and the list of services the client wishes to gain tickets to.   (See the   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/online%20authentication%20api%20spec.doc"  Online Authentication API Spec ).   The TGS looks at this list of services, and compares it to what each user has subscribed toThis list is compared to what each user has subscribed to, as listed in  according to user_subscriptions.   If a requested service is part of an offering the user has a current subscription to, the client is given a ticket to this service; otherwise an error code is returned. Attribute Parameter-level authorization Attributes The properties of a user s subscription can be accessed on the client by calling XOnlineGetOfferingParameterAttributeValues(), with the id of the attribute parameter they re interested in.  This returns a list of the values for the requested attributeparameter, according to the offering(s) the user is currently subscribed to.   They can also call XOnlineVerifyOfferingParameterValue() with both a parameter id and value to check, which will return a positive result if the user has the given parameter/value pair in their list of properties. Similarly, a server can call GetUserOfferingParameterValues with the parameter they query, or GetUserHasOfferingParameterValue with both a parameter and value.   This should provide the same information as the corresponding client APIs, and supports server-based authorization of the same functionality.   The definition and application of the attributes properties is service-specific; the functionality of the billing service only sees it as a series of name/value pairs associated with an offering.  For an example application of attributes, consider the matchmaking service.   A basic subscription could include 4 player matchmaking, and a premium subscription could include 16 player matchmaking.  The number of players one could include in matchmaking, according to their subscription level, would be stored as a  max multiplayer  attribute, with the value of 4 or 16.  As another example, say a subscription to a title s offering includes downloading the monthly  map of the month .     The CatRef service could define a  free content  attribute, and list the map(s) included with the offering.    Example application   service functionality As an example, consider this theoretical subscription offering: Bronze Subscription Offering Services Matchmaking Buddy lists Content download Properties  Max # of people in buddy list: 10 Content: Tony Hawk NY track Content: Tony Hawk SF track If a user, who is a subscriber to this offering, wants to use his buddy list, the title calls XOnlineLogon(), specifying the buddy list service as one of the services.  On the server, the TGS checks the user_subscriptions table is checked to ensure the user has subscribed to an offering that includes access to the buddy list service.  If it does, a ticket to the buddy list service is included in the returned ticket.  Now say the user wants to add people to his buddy list.   However, the buddy list API knows there might be a configurable limitation on the number of people he can add, depending on the offering the user is subscribed to.   So, the client calls XOnlineGetOfferingParameterValues(Max # of people in buddy list).  This does a round-trip to the server, checks the offerings listed in user_subscriptions for the Max # of people in buddy list parameter, and returns the value of 10.   The client is then able to allow the additional members, or if he s at the max, encourage an upgrade.   (Note: this same authz check could be done by the buddy service on the server via soap, in lieu of (or in conjunction with) the client check.) If, at some later date, marketing decided people who have bronze packages typically have more than 10 friends, they can increase it to the desired count without requiring further changes. Example application   content purchases s say the user has a subscription to the bronze offering above.    He also purchases the following map offering: Tony Hawk Space Track Properties Content: Tony Hawk London track This adds the corresponding offer_id to user_subscriptions, which effectively adds this map (specifically, the package_id of the map) to the list of content the user can access.    Now, if the title were to call XOnlineGetOfferingParameterValues(Content), it would receive ids for the  Tony Hawk NY track , the  Tony Hawk SF track , and the  Tony Hawk London track .  This might be useful if Tony Hawk is displaying a list of content available to the user for download.      Alternatively, it can verify the rights to the London Track by calling XOnlineVerifyOfferingParameterValue(Content, Tony Hawk London Track).     (NOTE: this might be called as a part of XOnlineVerifyContent(), but the application is the same).  Customer Service Interface   our billing partner should provide most of this.  Is there anything necessary on our end? Title maintenance For the first rev, maintaining the list of titles, subscription and content offerings will be done manually.   We may put together a quick Access front-end to a pre-production database help ensure integrity, but we anticipate doing anything more would be overkill for the # of online titles we ll have in the first year.  Adding titles Creating subscription offerings Creating package deals Security This section should cover potential security issues and how these will be addressed.  This section should consider at a minimum the threat groupings (STRIDE) put together by the Secure Windows Initiative team.  For more information on security, see the SWI team web site at   HYPERLINK "http://swiweb"  http://swiweb .  The STRIDE groupings are detailed in the sections below: Spoofing Identity Spoofing existing PUID   a hacker could conceivably modify the PUID of an existing member submitted to /uaccts/CreatePPAcct, thus associating their Xbox user with some else s billing account.    We ll attempt to prevent this by having the server encrypt the results of /uaccts/PPExists with the server s private key (?). Spoofing existing member name/password   if a hacker discovered another member s PC-based user name/password that already had a billing account associated with it, they could associate their xbox account with this hacked account.   Unfortunately there s not much we can do about this, except depend on the strength of the existing account s password.   It s the same problem any other MS service would have.  Modification of XName -- Tampering with Data Tampering with data involves the malicious modification of system or user data with or without detection. An unauthorized change made to stored or in-transit information, the formatting of a hard disk, the introduction by a malicious intruder of an undetectable network packet in a communication, and an undetectable change made to a sensitive file are all examples of tampering threats Repudiability  Repudiability threats are associated with users malicious or otherwise who can deny performing an action without administrators having any way to prove otherwise. An example of a repudiability threat is a user performing an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace such operations. Information Disclosure Information disclosure threats involve the compromising of private or business-critical information through the exposure of that information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user's ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to and an intruder's ability to read data in transit between two computers are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that in this case the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to appear as a legitimate user. Denial of Service (DoS) Denial of service (DoS) threats when carried out deny service to valid users for example, by making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable or by forcing a reboot or restart of the user's machine. You must protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability. Other types of DoS threats, however, are very hard to protect against; at a minimum, you should identify and rationalize such threats. Elevation of Privilege In this type of threat, an unprivileged user gains privileged access and thereby has sufficient access to compromise or destroy the entire system. The more dangerous aspect of such threats is the compromising of the system in undetectable ways whereby the user can take advantage of privileges without the knowledge of system administrators. Elevation of privilege threats include those situations in which an attacker has effectively penetrated all system defenses and become part of the trusted system itself at that point, the attacker can cause extreme system damage. Operations This section is owned by the OPMs and will be fleshed out by them based on the operations needs of the feature. There are a couple of high level sections listed below but the OPMs will have final determination on what is needed in this section. Errors and Alerts This section should detail all the errors and alerts that will be thrown by the feature   this includes server to Xbox, Xbox to server, server to server, server to monitoring, etc.  This is a very important section for server features.  All components that run on the servers should send useful errors and alerts so that the service can be properly monitored and managed.  Remember, real people will be supporting the service in the data center so human readable / understandable messages are very important. Performance and Load Considerations This section should contain best estimates of how the feature will perform and impact the service once deployed.  This section should include (but is not limited to) items like the following: Average size of data transferred from Xbox to server and/or server to server Average size of data that is stored on the server by the feature The frequency of this data exchange Maximum data size allowed to be transferred / stored Number of data exchanges the servers will have to support over a given time (i.e. 50 requests / second) Client API summary XONLINE_OFFERING structure The XONLINE_OFFERING contains the information for subscription, content or other offerings.  typedef struct { DWORD dwOfferingId; WCHAR szName[XONLINE_MAX_OFFERING_NAME_LENGTH]; WCHAR szDescription[XONLINE_MAX_OFFERING_DESC_LENGTH]; IN float fPrice; XONLINE_OFFERING_TERM eTerm; DWORD dwType; } XONLINE_OFFERING, *PXONLINE_OFFERING; Members dwOfferingId Specifies the offering identifier.  szName The name of the offering. szDescription Description of the offering. fPrice The offering price, in the user s locale. dwType The type of offering.

All are asynchronous tasks except where otherwise noted. Function Description Memory Allocation XonlineOfferingEnumerate Gets a set of available offerings for a given user. XOnlineOfferingEnumerateGetResults Gets the results of an enumerate call. Synchronous. XOnlineOfferingEnumerateMaxSize Calculates the required size of an enumeration buffer. Synchronous. XOnlineOfferingGetDetails Retrieves a set of user-specific details for a particular offering, including pricing and further title-specific data. XOnlineOfferingDetailsGetResults  Retrieves the results from a Details call (above).  This call is synchronous. XOnlineOfferingDetailsMaxSize Calculates the required size of a details buffer. Synchronous. XOnlineOfferingPriceFormat An utility function to provide an offering price in an account-localized string format (following a Details call).  Synchronous. XOnlineOfferingPurchase Purchases an offering for a given user. XOnlineOfferingCancel Cancels an existing offering owned by a given user. XOnlineOfferingVerifyLicense Verifies the rights to use an offering. Detailed API Description Enumerating Offers XOnlineOfferingEnumerate HRESULT  XOnlineOfferingEnumerate(     IN XONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_DEVICE Device,     IN DWORD dwUserIndex,     IN PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS pEnumParams,     IN OPTIONAL PBYTE pbBuffer,     IN DWORD cbBuffer,     IN OPTIONAL HANDLE hWorkEvent,     OUT XONLINETASK_HANDLE *phTask Synopsis: This call allows the title to enumerate all the of the available offerings for the given user, both locally and remotely.  The remainder of this write-up will discuss only the online/server-based case pending further updates.  Until then, please see the (somewhat outdated but applicable)  Content API Spec  or talk to KeithLau for HD/DVD enumeration info. Parameters: Device The device from which to enumerate content. Currently, the following devices are supported: XONLINECONTENT_ENUM_DEVICE_DVD   enumerate from DVD title disc XONLINECONTENT_ENUM_DEVICE_HD   enumerate content installed on the hard disk XONLINECONTENT_ENUM_DEVICE_ONLINE   enumerate content available for download dwUserIndex The controller index of the user who is requesting the enumeration.  This function does NOT allow guest access.  The user specified must be the paying customer. pEnumParams This argument points to a structure of enumeration paramters, discussed in the next section. pbBuffer An optional work buffer used to build request packets and receive results. If the caller specifies NULL, a buffer will be allocated internally to send and receive data. cbBuffer This specifies the size of the buffer to use. If pbBuffer is not NULL, then cbBuffer specifies the size of the buffer provided. If pbBuffer is NULL, then cbBuffer indicates the size of the buffer to be allocated internally. The value of cbBuffer must be large enough to contain the enumeration request packet or the function will fail. Please see Remarks below. hWorkEvent This optional parameter allows the caller to specify an event handle which will be set to signaled state when work is available.  phTask Upon success, this out parameter returns a handle to the content enumeration task. (Extended) Offering enumeration parameters typedef struct DWORD       dwOfferingType; DWORD       dwBitFilter;         DWORD       dwDescriptionIndex;// Publisher-specific index     DWORD       dwMaxResults;   // Desired max number of results     FILETIME    ftActiveAfter;  // Return items newer than this date  } XONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS, *PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS; dwOfferingType This is a bitfilter on service-wide offering types.   dwBitFilter This is a publisher-specific bitfilter that is used to filter the results that come back from the server.  The intention is to use this for game/title-specific categories of content/subscriptions.  (Say,  weapons armor magic , etc.)  Meaning is publisher-defined. dwDescriptionIndex This is a title-specific value used as a selector between alternate descriptions of a single offering.  Intended primarily to distinguish between supported languages, it determines what binary enumeration blob is returned from the server on a per-offer basis.  Meaning is title-specific, and is not enforced to be language. dwMaxResults Enumeration results are returned in chunks and this parameter specifies the maximum number of results that are returned in each chunk.  A value of zero tells the server to ignore the number of records and fit as many as possible. ftActiveAfter This parameter allows the caller to specify a date-timestamp to filter results based on date. Return Values: The task is successfully created and the task handle is returned in phTask. The caller must service the asynchronous task by periodically calling XOnlineTaskContinue.  E_OUTOFMEMORY There are insufficient system resources to start the enumeration. ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER This specific error code indicates that the size specified in cbBuffer is not large enough to hold the enumeration request. See remarks below on choosing an appropriate value for cbBuffer. Any error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. XOnlineTaskContinue Behavior: Upon success this function returns a handle to the asynchronous task. The caller must call XOnlineTaskContinue periodically to service this task. The result of the Continue call is used to determine further action. If XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING is returned, continued servicing of the task is required. If XONLINETASK_S_RESULTS_AVAIL is returned, then the caller should go ahead and call XOnlineOfferingEnumerateGetResults to pick up the current result set. That function may indicate that further results are available; if so, further servicing of the enumeration task will get the next set.  (See the GetResults description for more information.)  During this process, the XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING will once again be returned by the Continue function until more results are subsequently available. If an error occurs during the enumeration, it is returned via an error HRESULT from the Continue function. The Enumeration task can be Closed at any point.  Note that this frees any memory allocated by the API. Internal Protocol Information: This is the wire structure for an enumeration request: typedef struct     XONLINE_WIRE_HEADER         Header;              ULONGLONG                   Puid;                DWORD                       dwTitleId;           DWORD                       cbClientBuffer;         DWORD                       dwRating;                XONLINEOFFERING_ID          ResumePosition;      XONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS Params;          } XONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_REQ, *PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_REQ; The wire header consists of two DWORDS, a cbSize and a reserved DWORD.  The Puid is translated from the controller index.  TitleId and Rating are culled from the XBOX (the current title and current ESRB rating).  cbClientBuffer indicates the upper bound on bytes returned.  ResumePosition is the most recent Offering ID seen on the client so that the server knows where in an enumeration to start getting results. The server s response consists of a header, followed by some number of enumeration records (see the GetResults section for information on those).  If there are no results, the server returns a successful HTTP response with no payload at all.   The response header is: typedef struct     XONLINE_WIRE_HEADER         Header;     // Wire struct header     WORD                        cRecords;   // Number of records returned     WORD                        fFlags;     // Enumeration response flags } XONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_RESP_HEADER, *PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_RESP_HEADER; The cbSize in the WIRE_HEADER is the size of the entire set returned.  The fFlags is a set of  bitflags giving the client some information about this result set.  The current options for those are: XONLINEOFFERING_RESP_FLAG_MORE_RESULTS         [More results are available] XONLINEOFFERING_RESP_FLAG_DONT_CACHE         [These results should not be cached         on the client] Server Activity Overview An enumeration request initiates the following sequence on the server: The request is unpacked and sanity-checked. The user s billing country is retrieved from the UODB to determine which offers apply to him/her. All the request information is used to generate a key string that uniquely identifies this enumeration request. The FD cache is checked for this enumeration resultset.   If the resultset is in the cache, that is used.  Otherwise the UODB is hit for the resultset, based on all the criteria passed in with the enumerartion parameters.  The DB is asked for the entire enumeration. The result is cached if it wasn t already. Using the entire enumeration, the correct first record is found using the ResumePosition value.  From there, results are written to the output stream until either the max results is exceeded, the max bytes is exceeded, or the end of the enumeration is reached.  The appropriate status of  partial results  is set in the header. The results are all sent back to the client. XOnlineOfferingEnumerateGetResults HRESULT  XOnlineOfferingEnumerateGetResults(     IN XONLINETASK_HANDLE hTask,     OUT PXONLINEOFFERING_INFO **prgpOfferingInfo,     OUT DWORD *pdwReturnedResults,     OUT BOOL *pfMoreResults Synopsis: This is called when the Enumerate task returns a XONLINETASK_S_RESULTS_AVAIL or an XONLINETASK_S_SUCCEEDED from TaskContinue.  Data Structures: The following data structure is used to represent an offering record: typedef struct {     XONLINEOFFERING_ID  OfferingId;             // Offering ID     DWORD               dwOfferingType;         // Offering type     DWORD               dwBitFlags;             // Package-specific flags     DWORD               cbPackageSize;          // Package wire size (bytes)     DWORD               cbInstallSize;          // Installed size (bytes)     FILETIME            ftActivationDate;       // Activation date of package     DWORD               dwRating;               // Package rating     DWORD               cbTitleSpecificData;    // Size of data blob (bytes)     PBYTE               pbTitleSpecificData;    // Pointer to data blob } XONLINEOFFERING_INFO, *PXONLINEOFFERING_INFO; The results returned by this function will be a series of these records.  Each record is followed  immediately by the binary enumeration blob of title-specific descriptive data, if any. Parameters: hTask The enumeration task handle. prgpOfferingInfo       A pointer to a vector of pointers to  XONLINEOFFERING_INFO structures (vs. pointer to an array of pointers to structs). i.e. ((*prgpOfferingInfo)[i])->wszName is the name of the ith returned record. pdwReturnedResults This receives the number of records returned in this chunk. Note that a value of zero is valid an it indicates that there are no more results to enumerate. pfMoreResults This out parameter tells the caller whether this is the last chunk of results. If this is TRUE, then the caller should expect more results, otherwise, this will be the last chunk of results. Return Values: The task is successfully performed. Any error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. Remarks: Note: Callers will NOT have to free prgpOfferingInfo when they are done, but they must call XOnlineTaskFree(hTask) AFTER they are done with prgpOfferingInfo. XOnlineOfferingEnumerateMaxSize DWORD  XOnlineOfferingEnumerateMaxSize(     IN PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS pEnumParams,     IN OPTIONAL DWORD cbTitleSpecificDataMaxSize     ); Synopsis: Utility function to determine the absolute upper bound memory requirements for receiving a specified number of offering entries. Data Structures: See section 2.1.1 for information about PXONLINEOFFERING_ENUM_PARAMS.   Parameters: pEnumParams The same parameters that will be passed into the Enumeration call. cbTitleSpecificDataMaxSize This parameter allows the caller to specify an upper bound on the per-offer size of the enumeration blob, allowing the title to tune the results of this function if it knows that its maximum size is less than the absolute allowable maximum.  Passing in zero here uses the default global maximum value.    Return Values: A DWORD specifying the most memory possibly required to retrieve the number  of enumeration records being asked for. Offering Details Once a user indicates interest in an offer, the title should call the Details APIs to get further information about that offer as it applies to the particular user.  The  Details  of an offer include the following information: net price of the offer (before tax), gross price (after tax), currency, and a title-specific   of binary information which is stored on the publisher s behalf in the XBOS servers. The blob probably contains descriptive content about the offer and/or cross-sell/upsell information. XOnlineOfferingGetDetails HRESULT XOnlineOfferingGetDetails (      IN DWORD dwUserIndex,     IN XONLINEOFFERING_ID OfferingId,     IN WORD wLanguage,     IN DWORD dwDescriptionIndex,     IN PBYTE pbBuffer,     IN DWORD cbBuffer, IN HANDLE hWorkEvent,     OUT XONLINETASK_HANDLE *phTask      ); Synopsis: This API goes to the server for user-specific details about an offer.  It s asynchronous.  The resulting details are per-user, per-offer, per-language, and per-description index. Parameters: dwUserIndex The controller index of the user who is requesting the details.  This function does NOT allow guest access.  The user specified must be the paying customer. OfferingId The offering for which to obtain details.  This will probably come from an enumeration, but it could be hard-coded by savvy publishers, etc.   wLanguage This language parameter, along with the server-stored billing locale, is used to determine the formatting for the prices which are returned as parts of the details results.  The language must be one of the following: LANGUAGE_CURRENT       LANGUAGE_ENGLISH LANGUAGE_JAPANESE LANGUAGE_GERMAN       LANGUAGE_FRENCH       LANGUAGE_SPANISH       LANGUAGE_ITALIAN       These are the currently-supported XDash languages, defined        in an enumeration in the client header file.         LANGUAGE_CURRENT will use the current setting in the        XDash.  Ideally, parameter will be the current operating        language of the title, whether or not that is the Dash setting.       Note: This parameter is used only for price formatting, and is        not to be confused with the description blob selector, below. dwDescriptionIndex This is a title-specific index that determines which details blob to grab from the server for this offer.  This value will probably be used most often to differentiate between description languages for a single offer (which may be available in many regions).  However, the semantics of this field are not enforced by the service and are thus title-specific (indeed, they are technically offer-specific). pbBuffer A pointer to a buffer to use for receiving the details blob.  If this pointer is set to NULL, the Details function will do the allocation for you, using the value of cbBuffer as the details size.  THIS BUFFER MUST BE BIG ENOUGH no verification is done.  See below.  cbBuffer The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by pbBuffer (above).  If pbBuffer is NULL, this many bytes are allocated by the API.  Use XOnlineOfferingDetailsMaxSize to determine how big a buffer you will need. hWorkEvent This optional parameter allows the caller to specify an event handle which will be set to signaled state when work is available.  phTask Upon success, this out parameter returns a handle to the details task. Return Values: The task is successfully created and the task handle is returned in phTask. The caller must service the asynchronous task by periodically calling XOnlineTaskContinue. Any error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. XOnlineTaskContinue Behavior: Upon success this function returns a handle to the asynchronous task. The caller must call XOnlineTaskContinue periodically to service this task.  The HRESULT from that function determines what further action to take. While the task is still running, you will receive the XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING result.  The caller should continue to call XonlineTaskContinue until receiving a  XONLINETASK_S_RESULTS_AVAIL result.  This indicates that the task has completed and  results are available by calling XonlineOfferingDetailsGetResults (below).  Once the results have  been retreived, the result from continued servicing should be XONLINETASK_S_SUCCESS.  The  task is now completely finished, so the handle can be Closed.   Remarks: IMPORTANT: If you rely on the API to allocate the details buffer for you, you cannot Close the  task handle until you are done using the buffer.  (Closing frees all memory associated with the  task, including any buffers allocated by the API.) Internal Protocol Information: This is the wire structure for a details request: typedef struct {     DWORD       cbSize;     ULONGLONG   qwUserPUID;     DWORD       dwOfferId;     DWORD       dwDescriptionIndex;     SHORT       sLanguageId; } XO_DETAILS_REQUEST;  cbSize is used for versioning, and in this case is always == 22.  The qwUserPUID is translated on  the client from the controller index.  The other values are just passed through from the caller.   The Details server s response consists of a header, followed immediately by binary blob data  from the server, if any.  The header looks like this: typedef struct {     DWORD cbSize;     DWORD dwGrossWholePart;     BYTE  bGrossFractionalPart;     DWORD dwNetWholePart;     BYTE  bNetFractionalPart;     BYTE  bCurrencyFormat;     CHAR  rgchISOCode[3];     DWORD dwSizeOfBlob; } XO_DETAILS_HEADER, *PXO_DETAILS_HEADER;  cbSize is the total size of the entire response, including any binary data.  Parsing/re-arranging for  caller convenience is done on the client side, promoting the first two BYTE-sized fields to  DWORDs, and promoting the CHAR array to wide chars.   Server Activity Overview A purchase request initiates the following sequence on the server: The request is unpacked and sanity-checked. A simulated purchase is made.  This involves all of the major steps listed under purchase, except the call to the billing provider is flagged to not commit the purchase.  Likewise, no changes are made to the UODB.  The purpose of this is to verify the user to make the purchase, but retrieve localized price/tax information about the offer without actually buying anything.   The gross and net prices returned are parsed, along with their currency type.  Taking into account the user s billing country, the language value sent up from the client, and the currency, a set of formatting logic determines the best way to format the price for the user.  This result is packed into a format byte to be sent back to the client, and the prices are split from text into integers.  All this information is put into the response structure. The actual details blob is filled into the response structure, by querying the UODB for the details blob (which is actually stored as a sequence of 8000 byte chunks) and reconstituting it from its parts.  The response is packed up and sent back down to the client. XOnlineOfferingDetailsGetResults HRESULT XOnlineOfferingDetailsGetResults (      IN XONLINETASK_HANDLE hTask,     OUT PBYTE *pDetailsBuffer,     OUT DWORD *pcbDetailsLength,     OUT XONLINE_PRICE *pGrossPrice,     OUT XONLINE_PRICE *pNetPrice  Synopsis: This gets the results from a successful details call. Data Structures: The following data structure is used to represent a price (returned by GetResults): typedef struct {     DWORD dwWholePart;     DWORD dwFractionalPart;     BYTE  bCurrencyFormat;     WCHAR rgchISOCurrencyCode[3]; } XONLINE_PRICE, *PXONLINE_PRICE; dwWholePart An integral value representing the whole part of the price (the number to the left of the decimal place). dwFractionalPart An integral value representing the decimal part of the price, if applicable (this will be zero for currencies which do not use it). bCurrencyFormat This is a byte which stores customized formatting information for the price, based on format logic stored in the server.  Its meaning is opaque to title developers, and it s used only internally by XOnlineOfferingPriceFormat (below), which is the recommended means of creating a text string from a price. rgchISOCurrencyCode This 3-wchar array stores the ISO code for the currency of the price.  For example, US Dollars are  , Japanese Yen are  , and Euros are  Parameters: All four output pointers are optional.  Supplying NULL for any of them will force them to be ignored.   hTask This is the GetDetails task from which to pull the results.  The task MUST have returned XONLINETASK_S_RESULTS_AVAIL from the most recent Continue call. pDetailsBuffer This PBYTE pointed to is set to point to the binary details blob. pcbDetailsLength The DWORD pointed to is set to the length, in bytes, of the binary details blob. pGrossPrice The price structure pointed to is set to the gross (tax inclusive) price of the offer for this user. pNetPrice The price structure pointed to is set to the net (exclusive of tax) price of the offer for this user. Return Values: an HRESULT Reserved.  For now, always S_OK. Remarks: In addition to getting results, this function will  complete  the task so that subsequent calls to Continue will no longer show XONLINETASK_S_RESULTS_AVAIL, but XONLINETASK_S_SUCCEEDED.   The task can be Closed at either stage; once the task is Closed, unretrieved results are lost.  As noted above, if you rely on the API to allocate your buffer, do not Close a GetDetails task until you are done using the results buffer. XOnlineOfferingDetailsMaxSize DWORD XOnlineOfferingDetailsMaxSize(     IN DWORD cbTitleSpecificDataMaxSize Synopsis: This provides the client with the upper-bound memory requirement for a GetDetails buffer. A title can call this function to find out how much memory they should allocate (or request from the API), before making a GetDetails call. Parameter: cbTitleSpecificDataMaxSize This is the maximum number of bytes that a title expects in its binary details blob.  If the title does not enforce its own maximum, but instead defers to the service-wide maximum for these blobs, simply pass in zero here and the default value will be used. Return Values: a DWORD The number of bytes to use in allocating (or requesting) a Details buffer. XOnlineOfferingDetailsPriceFormat  HRESULT XOnlineOfferingPriceFormat(      IN XONLINE_PRICE *Price,     IN LPWSTR        lpwszFormattedPrice,     OUT DWORD        *cbLength,     IN DWORD         dwExtendedCharsFilter Synopsis: This is a helpful utility function to format a price appropriately in text, having retrieved it from a GetDetails call.  A title may or may not need to call this API, depending on their formatting needs, but if they do convert the price of an offer to a string before display, this is the recommended way of doing so. Parameters: Price This is the price to be formatted.  It is of type XONLINE_PRICE, returned from a details GetResults call. lpwszFormattedPrice This is a string in which the formatted price will be placed.  It needs to be large enough to contain the formatted price; its size in bytes is passed in through cbLength. cbLength cbLength contains the size of the lpwszFormattedPrice buffer.  If this value is not big enough, an appropriate size will be placed here on return (in conjunction with an error).  It will be written with the new string length in case of success. dwExtendedCharsFilter This is a set of bitflags indicating the extended characters that are acceptable for use in constructing the price string.  The API expects support for basic 7-bit ASCII (ie, including the dollar sign), but beyond this will use extended and Unicode symbols if necessary and if supported by the title.  The API uses appropriate failure cases where support is not provided for the native currency symbol. Indicate support by setting the following bitflags appropriately: XO_CURRENCY_EUR  (Euro) XO_CURRENCY_GBP  (UK Pound)   XO_CURRENCY_JPY   (Japanese Yen) XO_CURRENCY_KRW   (Korean Won) Return Values: an HRESULT This will indicate success (S_OK) if all went well, or an insufficient buffer error if the string passed in was too small to contain the formatted price.  In both cases, the correct price length will be passed back via cbLength. Purchasing and Canceling Offerings XOnlineOfferingPurchase HRESULT  XOnlineOfferingPurchase(      IN DWORD dwUserIndex,      IN XONLINEOFFERING_ID OfferingId,      IN HANDLE hWorkEvent,     OUT XONLINETASK_HANDLE *phTask  );    Synopsis: This asynchronous task purchases an offering on behalf of a currently-logged-in user. Parameters: dwUserIndex The controller index of the user who is requesting the purchase.  This function does NOT allow guest access.  The user specified must be the paying customer. OfferingId The offering to purchase.  This will probably come from an enumeration, but it could be hard-coded by savvy publishers, etc.   hWorkEvent This optional parameter allows the caller to specify an event handle which will be set to signaled state when work is available.  phTask Upon success, this out parameter returns a handle to the purchase task. Return Values: The task is successfully created and the task handle is returned in phTask. The caller must service the asynchronous task by periodically calling XOnlineTaskContinue. Any error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. XOnlineTaskContinue Behavior: Upon success this function returns a handle to the asynchronous task. The caller must call XOnlineTaskContinue periodically to service this task.  The HRESULT from that function determines what further action to take. While the task is still running, you will receive the XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING result.  The caller should continue to call XonlineTaskContinue until receiving either a success result, or one  of the applicable error states.  XBOS-specific errors are defined in the header, and are in the  XOFF_E_* family.  The task can be Closed once it has completed.  You may NOT call Close on a purchase task  before it has completed there is no meaning to canceling a purchase request in process; once  called, the purchase request must be completed.    Internal Protocol Information: This is the wire structure for a purchase request: typedef struct {     DWORD        cbSize;     ULONGLONG    qwUserPUID;     DWORD        dwOfferingId; } XO_PURCHASE_REQUEST; cbSize is used for versioning, and in this case is always == 16.  The qwUserPUID is translated on  the client from the controller index.  The OfferingId is passed through from the caller.   Server response is only through the XRL result: an HTTP 200 on success and an HTTP 500 on  error, with the X-Err header field set to the appropriate HRESULT. Server Activity Overview A purchase request initiates the following sequence on the server: The request is unpacked and sanity-checked. The UODB is queried with the offer ID.  This serves two functions, first to verify that the  offer ID exists, and second to get back the  billing offer id  (which is the separate offer tracking number used by SPS) and the  friendly name  string that internally describes the offer for SPS. The UODB is queried again, this time with the user s PUID.  In return, we get a bunch of  SPS-useful data, like account ID (separate from puid), pay info id, contact phone id, and address id.      4.  The UODB is queried yet again, to ensure that this user has permission to make this           purchase.  The following conditions need to be met: a. The current date/time must be within the offer's validity window b. The offer must be a base offer, OR the offer must require one which the     user already owns. c. The user must not already own this offer. d. The user has the  purchase enabled  flag set e. The offer matches the title    5. If everything checks out, SPS is contacted with the info from step 2-3 and instructed to         log the purchase in the billing record.    6. The UODB is updated to reflect the user owning the offer.  The status is set to  enabled         the offer. If an error occurs at any point along this path, an exception is thrown and the error is communicated back via XRL. XOnlineOfferingCancel HRESULT  XOnlineOfferingCancel(      IN DWORD dwUserIndex,      IN XONLINEOFFERING_ID OfferingId,      IN HANDLE hWorkEvent,     OUT XONLINETASK_HANDLE *phTask  );    Synopsis: This asynchronous task cancels an offering held by a currently-logged-in user. Parameters: dwUserIndex The controller index of the user who is requesting the cancel.  This function does NOT allow guest access.  The user specified must be the paying customer and must own the offer already. OfferingId The offering to cancel.   hWorkEvent This optional parameter allows the caller to specify an event handle which will be set to signaled state when work is available.  phTask Upon success, this out parameter returns a handle to the cancel task. Return Values: The task is successfully created and the task handle is returned in phTask. The caller must service the asynchronous task by periodically calling XOnlineTaskContinue. Any error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. XOnlineTaskContinue Behavior: Upon success this function returns a handle to the asynchronous task. The caller must call XOnlineTaskContinue periodically to service this task.  The HRESULT from that function determines what further action to take. While the task is still running, you will receive the XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING result.  The caller should continue to call XonlineTaskContinue until receiving either a success result, or one  of the applicable error states.  XBOS-specific errors are defined in the header, and are in the  XOFF_E_* family.  The task can be Closed once it has completed.  You may NOT call Close on a cancel task  before it has completed there is no meaning to stopping a cancel request in process; once  called, the request must be completed.    Remarks The cancel functionality will only cancel an offering that the user currently holds and that is marked cancelable.  If the user holds multiples of the given offering, an arbitrary one of them will be canceled.  If titles user per-instance state for their offerings (ie, owning multiple items, each with evolving characteristics), this state is maintained by the title alone; there is no way of knowing which entry is canceled (ie, differentiated by purchase date, etc). Internal Protocol Information: This is the wire structure for a cancel request: typedef struct {     DWORD        cbSize;     ULONGLONG    qwUserPUID;     DWORD        dwOfferingId; } XO_CANCEL_REQUEST; cbSize is used for versioning, and in this case is always == 16.  The qwUserPUID is translated on  the client from the controller index.  The OfferingId is passed through.   Server response is only through the XRL result: an HTTP 200 on success and an HTTP 500 on  error, with the X-Err header field set to the appropriate HRESULT. Server Activity Overview A cancel request initiates the following sequence on the server: The request is unpacked and sanity-checked. The offer is checked through the UODB to be deemed  OK to cancel  for the user.  The following conditions must be met: The user must hold at least one instance of the offer The offer must be marked as cancelable A cancel request is passed through to the billing provider, giving it the unique ID of the specific line-item subscription to cancel. The offer status in the UODB for that line-item is changed to  canceled , and the end date of the subscription is changed to the current date/time. If an error occurs at any point along this path, an exception is thrown and the error is communicated back via XRL. XOnlineOfferingVerifyLicense HRESULT  XOnlineOfferingVerifyLicense(      IN DWORD dwOfferingId,      IN DWORD dwUserAccounts,     IN HANDLE hWorkEvent, OUT XONLINETASK_HANDLE *phTask );    Synopsis: This asynchronous task ensures one or more of the currently logged-in users have rights to the given offering. NOTE: for v1, this API is private to save on testing efforts, as it s only expected to be used by XOnlineContentVerify().     It will, however, eventually be publicly exposed and documented.  Parameters: dwOfferingId The offering id to verify rights to. dwUserAccounts Flags specifying one or more accounts to use in the rights verification.   Is one or more of the following values, OR d together: XONLINE_LOGON_CONTROLLER1 logged on user at controller 1 XONLINE_LOGON_CONTROLLER2 logged on user at controller 2 XONLINE_LOGON_CONTROLLER3 logged on user at controller 3 XONLINE_LOGON_CONTROLLER4 logged on user at controller 4 XONLINE_LOGON_MACHINE machine account XONLINE_LOGON_ALL all users and the machine account. hWorkEvent This optional parameter allows the caller to specify an event handle which will be set to signaled state when work is available.  phTask Upon success, this out parameter returns a handle to the verification task. Return Values: The task is successfully created and the task handle is returned in phTask. The caller must service the asynchronous task by periodically calling XOnlineTaskContinue. XOFF_E_PERMISSION_DENIED None of the users specified in dwUserAccounts has permissions to use the offering.   Any other error HRESULT code The specific failure described by the HRESULT has occurred. XOnlineTaskContinue Behavior: Upon success this function returns a handle to the asynchronous task. The caller must call XOnlineTaskContinue periodically to service this task.  The HRESULT from that function determines what further action to take. While the task is still running, you will receive the XONLINETASK_S_RUNNING result.  The caller should continue to call XonlineTaskContinue until receiving either a success result, or one  of the applicable error states.  XBOS-specific errors are defined in the header, and are in the  XOFF_E_* family.  The task can be Closed at any time.   If done before XOnlineTaskContinue returns XONLINETASK_S_SUCCESS, the license check is canceled. Remarks The license check will verify any accounts specified in dwUserAccounts has rights to use the offering id.   There two types of rights that can apply to an offering: Machine Rights   an offering is purchased for a machine.  Any user on that machine can then use that offering, irrespective of who originally purchased it.  The offering can be used indefinitely; no subscription is required once downloaded.   Furthermore, it is not required for the machine to be logged in (via XOnlineLogon) for the offering to be used, unless the offering needs to be re-downloaded (in which case the purchasing user s subscription must still be active).      However, the offering can only be downloaded to the original machine, and does not   with the purchasing user. User Rights   an offering is purchased for a user.   That offering can only be used if that user is logged in and is at one of the controllers specified in dwUserAccounts parameter. Any content associated with the offer can be downloaded by that user on to any machine.    Once the user s subscription is expired, the offering can no longer be used. s possible to use an offering that has machine rights without calling XOnlineLogon.   Any associated content must already be on the local hard drive, and the title must have knowledge that the offering is protected using machine rights, not user rights; otherwise XOFF_E_PERMISSION_DENIED will be returned.  Internal Protocol Information: When a license is requested, the dwUserAccounts are first translated to the corresponding user and/or machine PUIDs. Offering licenses are stored in a local cache using the Cache* APIs.   These licenses are as follows: struct XO_OFFERING_LICENSE    // Versioning    DWORD cbSize;    // Content Information    DWORD dwTitleID;    DWORD dwOfferingId;    // Content Usage Conditions    WORD       wConditionFlags;    BYTE       byRightID;    BYTE       byUseCount;    FILETIME   filetimeRefresh;    FILETIME   filetimeFrom;    FILETIME   filetimeTo;    ULONGLONG  qwPassportUserID;    // signature to prevent tampering    XCALCSIG_SIGNATURE Signature; cbSize size of the XO_OFFERING_LICENSE struct. dwTitleId the title associated with the offering wConditionFlags Flags specifying application of the license: Flag Name Flag Value Description XO_LIC_TIMEREFRESH 0x0001 The systimeRefresh field contains data that needs to be enforced. XO_LIC_USECOUNT 0x0002 The byUseCount field contains data that needs to be enforced. XO_LIC_TIMEFROM 0x0004 The systimeFrom field contains data that needs to be enforced. XO_LIC_TIMETO 0x0008 The systimeTo field contains data that needs to be enforced. XO_LIC_USERID 0x0010 The qwPassportUserID contains data that needs to be enforced. The other bits of this field are reserved for future usage.  byRightId Specifies the right described by this DRM token: Right Name Field Value Description XOD_PLAY_RIGHT  right indicates the DRM token can be used to enable content play.  Note that this field isn t an array of bit fields. Each license shall only contain one right.  For the same game, a game publisher might want to issue   licenses as well as paid-for   licenses. For each right, the game publisher may want to have different condition flags. For example, any user can use the demo for an unlimited amount of time, but a specific user can   the full-featured game only for a month. byUseCount Specifies the number of times this offering shall be used.  filetimeRefresh Specifies the time until which this license can be used.  filetimeFrom Specifies the lower time bound from which this content can be used. filetimeTo Specifies the upper time bound until which this content can be used. qwPassportId Specifies the user to which this license applies.  Signature The signature of the license, to prevent tampering.     Licenses are indexed using the offeringId + puid combination.   A license for each PUID is checked; if a license is found, the following verification steps take place: Signature is checked, by generating a signature of the license (excluding the Signature field) and compared with the signature specified in the license.   If the signatures don t match, the license is deleted from the cache, and validation of this license is aborted. If dwConditionFlags includes XO_LIC_USERID, qwPassportUserId is compared with the user being checked.    If there s a mismatch, validation of the license is aborted. if dwConditionFlags includes XO_LIC_TIMEREFRESH, filetimeRefresh is compared with the current filetime.   If the refresh has expired, validation of the license is aborted. if dwConditionFlags includes XO_LIC_TIMEFROM, filetimeFrom is compared with the current filetime.   If the current time is before the value specified, validation is aborted. if dwConditionFlags includes XO_LIC_TIMETO, filetimeTo is compared with the current filetime.  If the current time is after the value specified, validation is aborted. if validation was not aborted, the license check completed successfully and the user has rights to the given offering.   The cache is closed, and XOnlineTaskContinue returns XONLINETASK_S_SUCCESS. If, after checking each of the PUIDs, no valid license is found, the request for the license is passed on to the server, to the XRL /xbos/VerifyLicense.ashx This is the wire structure for the license request: struct XO_VERIFY_LICENSE_REQUEST     DWORD       cbSize;     DWORD       dwTitleId;     DWORD       dwOfferId;     ULONGLONG   qwPuids[5]; cbSize  the size of the struct, used for versioning.  dwTitleId the id of the title making the request. dwOfferId the offering id to verify qwPuids[5]  the machine puid and  4 user puids to be included in the license check.    Any unused puids are set to 0. If the license check is successful, the server responds with status code 200, and a completely valid XO_OFFERING_LICENSE in the body.    This license is then added to the cache using the puid specified in the qwPassportUserId field of the returned license.  Server Activity Overview A verify license request initiates the following sequence on the server: The request is unpacked and sanity-checked. for each non-zero PUID, the stored procedure p_xbos_verify_license is called with the puid, machine puid and offer id. this procedure checks for a matching user   offering   machine (or machine=0) combination in user_subscriptions (for purchased offers) and t_offer_relations (for related offers).    This check is done via p_xbos_authorize_user. if the user is authorized, the i_policy parameter is set to the corresponding value in offerings..i_policy_flags. Upon successful authorization, the wConiditionFlags field of the offering license is set to the low word of i_policy_flags.  If these flags include XO_LIC_REFRESH, the refresh time is set to the dt_end_date field of the corresponding entry in t_user_subscriptions.   If these flags include XO_LIC_USERID, the qwPassportUserId field is set to the approved user.  NOTE: XO_LIC_USECOUNT, XO_LIC_TIMEFROM, XO_LIC_TIMETO are currently not supported.  If an error occurs at any point along this path, an exception is thrown, an event is logged and the error is communicated back via XRL. Operations Events EventID Source Category Description Performance Counters Text Logging Bracketed features are not currently implemented.  Purchase flag checking should/will be, and title matching is still up for debate. Should we publicly expose and simply not document / support? This is not yet implemented. wrjfjfjfjfrfb gdtl$ gdtl$ ve~ve~ev }umbZm gd+:x gd+:x gdr:2 gdr:2 gd+:x gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2 gdr:2

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation TitleMichael Fisher Normal.dot Michael Fisher Microsoft Office Wordbjbj\ Arbitration Bucket Migration Test Plan Introduction Bucket migration allows a stable and stateful method to take an Arbitration server out of service over time.  Each server has several buckets it is responsible for and sessions are allocated across all buckets.  The most common scenario is where a server needs to be taken out of the pool of Arb INH servers to allow it to be serviced without interrupting gameplay.  If a server needs to be taken out of rotation, its buckets can be reassigned to one or more of the remaining servers.  Any new sessions hashing to the remapped buckets will be created on the new destination servers.  Previously created sessions will continue to be handled by the server to be removed, however these will eventually complete or expire and with no new sessions being created on the server, it can be shutdown without affecting any player s experience. For example: There are 3 servers in the Arb INH pool.  Each server is assigned 20 buckets for a total of 60 buckets.  Server A needs to be taken out of rotation to be serviced.  Buckets 0   9 for Server A are remapped to Server B.  Buckets 10   19 are remapped to Server C.  This prevents new sessions from being created on Server A.  Once all the existing Arb sessions on Server A have completed or expired, servicing begins. Special Load Requirement Because bucket migration is expected to occur primarily during periods of normal traffic, the test harness executing the test cases will also create many additional sessions to insure correct behavior under this scenario.  This will be similar to Arb stress, however the load will not necessarily rise as high as stress levels require (900 TPS).  As sessions are created/extended/reported, the individual test cases will execute and verify their results under normal load.  Actual TPS of  background noise  is still TBD but estimated to be between 450   720 TPS. Test Cases Each of the test cases will execute a registration, time extend, and reportresults call for all buckets for verification.  All servers assume preexisting bucket ownership and the time for a migration to begin is 5 mins from now except where otherwise specified.  Cases in bold are mainline test cases (Ops scenarios).   Multiple servers  means 2 or 3, depending on the needs of the test case. Single Server Migration Scenarios Single server s single bucket remapped to single new destination server (no preexisting bucket ownership) Map a single bucket from one server to a new server Start: 1 End: 1 P_One_To_OneNew_SingleBucket Single server s single bucket remapped to single destination server Map a single bucket from one server to another server Start: 2 End: 2 P_One_To_One_SingleBucket Single server s all buckets remapped to single destination server Replace a single server with a new server Start: 1 End: 1 Original: Out of rotation P_One_To_OneNew_AllBuckets Single server s half of all buckets remapped to single destination server Add in a single new server with an existing server Start: 1 End: 2 Original: In rotation P_Mainline_One_To_OneNew_PartialBuckets Single server s 2/3 of all buckets remapped to multiple destination servers Add in multiple new servers Start: 1 End: 3 Original: In rotation P_One_To_TwoNew_PartialBuckets Single server s all buckets remapped to multiple new destination servers Replace one server with multiple new servers Start: 1 End: 2 Original: Out of rotation P_One_To_TwoNew_AllBuckets Single server s all buckets remapped to single destination server Remove a single server from a pool of two servers Start: 2 End: 1 Original: Out of rotation P_Mainline_One_To_Two_AllBuckets Single server s all buckets remapped to multiple destination servers Remove a single server from a pool of three servers Start: 3 End: 2 Original: Out of rotation P_One_To_Three_AllBuckets Single server s half of all buckets remapped to a single server that is itself in bucket migration (  of A s buckets ->B while   of B s buckets ->A).

In order to gather this revenue, we must provide a simple and quick way to initiate billing relationships with consumers, in a way that is friendly, intuitive and unobtrusive.     The intent of this document is to describe the API required by the client-side interface to enable this experience.   While it may suggest user interface at times, it s understood this UI will be spec d and developed separately.    The intent is to provide the programming interface to support the functionality of the UI, primarily in regards to client-server functionality.  Scenarios The following section describes the primary scenarios for billing signup. Basic subscription signup Joe has mastered Outlaw Golf, and wants to start showing off his putting prowess with real players online.   He selects the  Find an opponent  option in the game s main menu.   This is his first time going online with his XBox, so he goes through the account signup wizard, where he enters his name, address, credit card info and agrees to some standard terms and conditions.   He then selects the level of XOnline subscription he wishes to sign up for.   He chooses the basic, which includes matchmaking.     After completing the signup wizard, his xbox resets back into the game, and he s shown a list of opponents that closely match his skills.     Basic + Title subscription signup Jane receives Asheron s Car for her birthday.  She s thrilled, as it s the latest and greatest thing in online gaming for the XBox.   She opens the case and starts up her XBox with the game in the tray.   The game detects she doesn t yet have an online account, so it s rebooted to the account signup wizard in the dash.    She proceeds through the wizard, entering the requested information, and in addition to selecting the  XBox Basic Subscription , she also signs up for the  Asheron s Car Mercedes Subscription  option.    After completing signup, the game is reloaded, and she soon finds herself racing against Lugians through the streets of Dereth.    Content extension purchase John has been playing Unreal for weeks now, and has mastered all the levels included with the game.     He finds himself at the familiar map selection menu, however instead of selecting one of the normal maps, he notices another more interesting looking map available for a small fee.   Fortunately, he quite familiar with this whole online thing, and has even convinced his wife (who owns the billing account) to give him a $20/month spending limit.  The $4.95 price tag is well within his range, so he selects the map, confirms he wishes to purchase it, and the charge is added to his next statement (and deducted from his monthly allocation). Subscription cancellations Jack wants to reduce his monthly expenses.   He goes to the dash and decides to unsubscribe to his entire online account, which includes subscriptions to several games.   The dash walks him through canceling each game, however, when he goes to unsubscribe to Asheron s Car, the game shows a movie reminding him of what a wonderful world he s leaving and how he ll be even less popular with the girls if he stops playing.     He gives in and decides to cancel his magazine subscription to GQ instead. Goals The Billing Signup API has is designed with the following goals: Easy   It should be brain-dead simple for the user to sign up for the XBox Online service and to make purchases.   The dashboard and public APIs should be designed to make this experience simple for the title developers to provide.  Secure   To be successful, users will have to trust our service and any titles that use our service.  It should ensure the user s information is only accessible by the intended audience.  This includes making it easy for title developers to get it right.  Addictive   It should be a simple decision to subscribe, and a difficult decision (emotionally) to unsubscribe.     This means providing the functionality to enable up-selling to premium content, ample advertisement opportunity, and the ability to save a subscription when the user thinks they want to cancel.  Enabling   It should be easy enough for title developers to implement quickly but powerful enough to enable creative scenarios.  Design Billing signup will typically happen the first time a user discovers the availability of online content and decides to purchase it.     Usually this will be introduced through menu options in a title or disc included with a magazine, but may also happen when a user is simply exploring the dash.  In either case, signing up for a billing relationship involves 4 major phases: XBox machine account provisioning Passport account provisioning Billing account provisioning Performing subscriptions or one-time purchases. 1 happens automatically within the dash, the first time online functionality is required.   2 & 3 are typically done once per user   these have specific UI requirements, and therefore will happen within the dash and be implemented by the XBox online team.   The 4th is done one or more times for each online title   this may happen within the dash or within the title. The following flowchart outlines the process that occurs if a user were to make a content purchase or sign up for a subscription through the dashboard:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.6      The chart shows this in the context of loading a title; however the same could happen without the title in the drive.     In such cases, the user starts within the dash and navigates to either the  Accounts  area, or to making a purchase associated with a specific game within the  games  area.     The in-dash signup works best when the first time a user decides to make an online purchase.   In such cases, especially when the purchase is initiated through the title, we can show the aggregate purchase amount (basic subscription + title purchase) during the sign up process.   This allows us to feed the user the  bitter pill  once, instead of two separate occasions within a short time span.    Furthermore, it allows the presentation of cross-title deals, as well as providing all aspects of account maintenance in one central place.  Alternatively, a user may decide to make a purchase within a game.   The process outlined below represents a similar flow as above, except with the title-specific purchases happening in-game.   This process is ideal when the user has an established billing account, and sees something he wishes to purchase while in the title.   EMBED Visio.Drawing.6   The purchase will typically happen within a set of menus at the start of the title, for instance, within a map selection screen.   However these purchases may also happen while immersed in the game itself, i.e. to purchase the virtual Hammer of Thor for the r/l price of $4.95 in the RPG s General Store, or to buy another set of tokens to stay at the virtual blackjack table.  Are there legal requirements on the UI that we must follow any time a user adds charges to their account? Ideally, the only time the user would be required to leave the game is if they haven t yet set up the initial billing relationship.   In these cases, the purchase would then take place in-dash as outlined above.    In any case, the steps for creating a billable account and making purchases are very similar between both cases.   Each step is described in greater detail below.   All APIs are private unless otherwise specified.    In addition, the implementation of these APIs will almost exclusively communicate with mutually authenticated servers via secured HTTP requests using XRLs. Verifying existing accounts Before an Xbox can use online functionality, it must first attempt to log in users.   The XBE can enumerate through the available users via XOnlineGetUsers(), and attempt to sign-in selected users via XOnlineLogon(), passing the title s serviceName for custom services, and/or the XBox Online serviceName for content download, matchmaking and other XBox online services. (NOTE: XOnlineLogon() should implicitly call XOnlineCreateMachineAccount() when necessary.    This is a departure from the original specification, in which machine accounts could only be created inside the dash.   According to BoydM, however, the complexities originally thought to exist with creating machine accounts no longer exist, so this can be done implicitly.   The client implementation of XOnlineLogon() is probably the best to do this.) If one or more of the users wishing to log in doesn t have an established account, the title can reboot to the dash via XLAUNCHDASH(ACCOUNTS) to create the desired accounts.   Once this process is complete, the user reboots back to the title by hitting the   button, where the title can proceed with checking for purchases and/or making new purchases.  Can the title cache/pass  user login info to the dash?     Otherwise the user may be required to enter their pin 3 times (title, dash, then title again). It might be worthwhile to note, any activity associated with the user s account which causes the account to be deactivated or placed on hold (i.e. failure to pay a bill) will also place any 3rd-party service subscriptions on hold until the issue is resolved.   Therefore, successful authentication on any service indirectly includes verification of a good-standing subscription with the XBox Online service.    New account provisioning All accounts (user and machine) are created within the dashboard.    Each box and every user name are associated with a unique Passport account, and as such, will have a unique 64-bit passport ID.   In addition, each user is associated with billable account.    This may be their own account, a family s account, or a guest account.  Do guest accounts get their own passport ID? Machine account provisioning Machine accounts are created via an implicit call to the API XOnlineCreateMachineAccount().   This creates a unique passport sign-in name using a 12 digit serial number and a unique, randomly generated 128-bit password stored on the XBox EEPROM.   Other passport-required values (such as secret question/answer, region, etc.) will be randomly generated and/or given default values, and everything is passed to XOnlineCreatePassport() to allocate the passport account.   What happens if the machine account already exists in the PP db? See the   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/Xbox-Passport%20Online%20Authentication%20Protocol.doc"  Online Authentication Protocol  for more information on the XBox key and usage of machine accounts.  User account provisioning In creating a new user account, the user enters in their preference for a user name and zone.  This is represented to the user as user@zone.   The combination of these will be their unique identity within the XBox community, and is what they ll use to identify themselves within a game as well as to customer support.   This identity will not be tied to a specific box; the user is free to upload it to their MU and roam to any other XBox. Roaming might cause problems when attempting to log on to a box with a different locale.  Should this be limited to the original locale? The password for each user account will be randomly generated and will be 128 bits long.   At account creation time the random key will be generated on the server and sent back to the XBox, where it can be stored on the hard drive or on an XMU.   In lieu of a password, users have the option of protecting their account by entering a PIN-like code entered on the game controller.  This may be a sequence of button presses and d-pad controls.    The series of bytes representing the PIN is hashed and stored with the user account, and compared to the PIN captured any future time the user attempts to log in.  Is it safe to store the PIN on the client box? What happens if the user forgets his PIN?  At account creation time, the user will also be required to select a question from a pre-defined list of  secret questions , and enter in their answer at account creation time.      The purpose behind the secret question/answer is to enable the user to prove their identity when calling customer support. Selecting a user name and zone The user is presented with the opportunity to enter in the name and zone of their choice.   The name is limited to 64 characters, and follows under the same character restrictions as an email name.    The zone can be selected from a list of suggested zones, or the user can enter the name of another zone they re aware of.   However, the zone must be a pre-existing zone.  Do we really need to follow email names?   We can just encode/decode this under the covers, to allow for spaces and such The name and zone combination must be unique among all XBox Online accounts.      When a user has selected a name/zone combination, the interface calls XOnlineCreatePassport(), which will return an error if the account name already exists.   In these cases, XOnlineSuggestNames(zone) should be called to get a list of suggested names for the selected zone, or XOnlineSuggestZones(name) can be called to get a list of suggested zones where the name is not used.     Should we just transmit the data for the suggestions when the CreatePassport api fails? Should we provide access to the list of all available zones? Server note: Passport provides alternate name suggestion functionality, however these are usually created by appending numbers to the user s name.   To provide Cooler names, we may want to build a large db of gaming handles.   Turbine might have already created such a list for their RPG Billing account provisioning Once the user has allocated their user name and zone, they will need to create or be associated with a billing account.   This may be their own account, a member of a family account, or a guest account.  They may also come in to the bill provisioning section with an existing account, i.e. to modify their billing address.  In these cases, the existing user information can be retrieved via XOnlineGetUserBIllingInfo(PUID, &USER_BILLING_INFO).   On the other hand, new information is submitted via individual APIs; while this may incur more round-trips to the server, it should provide a better user experience, as this allows the interface to catch data entry errors before the user proceeds to the next screen. DESIGN ISSUE:  It s expected the interface for entering billing information will span several screens.   To provide a good user experience, each screen should be able to do any necessary data validation before proceeding to the next screen.    The text that follows assumes each screen roughly corresponds to the data used by each API, however, it may prove difficult to correctly factor these.   Would it be better to fill in the same USER_BILLING_INFO struct, and pass this to a single function (XOnlineUpdateUserBillingInfo()) which contains logic to validate and update only specified fields? Association with existing passport The user is first presented with the opportunity to associate the user account with an existing passport created on the PC.    This should be presented before gathering billing information, as it s possible the existing passport will already have billing information associated with it via passport wallet,  which can then be used to provide defaults (or bypass the remainder of account setup altogether).    Furthermore, this should allow us to tie in XBox billing with the billing of other services (such as MSNIA) and to tie in to  package deals  (i.e. 6 free months of XBox Online service with msn broadband subscription).  If a user chooses to enter an existing passport, the interface is pre-populated with the contents of USER_BILLING_INFO.SignIn.   Only the sign-in name is filled in; the password is left blank. Once the user has filled in the sign-in name and password, the information is passed to XOnlineAssociatePUIDWithPassport(PUID, signIn, password).    The PUID of the associated passport is never used on the client   this only serves as an association used by functionality provided by the server.  Association with existing XBox user account An account can be associated with an existing billable already created on the XBox.   This is useful for family or guest account cases, where one account pays for multiple logins.    How this is presented to the user is up to the UI design.   Its possible associated accounts are only created when the user is logged in with an existing billable account, or the new user is able to select an existing user to associate with.   In either case, one both the new user and existing users are selected, the association can be updated via XOnlineAssociatePUIDWithUser(new_PUID, existing_PUID).   Collecting billing information If the user wishes to create a new billing account, the interface will proceed to collect billing information, passing the information to XOnlineCreateAccount(PUID, account_data).  This API will do any necessary verification of the address and billing information, and allocate a new account within the billing service.     Will probably need more than one API for this functionality.   This would probably be the right place to give the user opportunity to enter coupon data.. Purchasing Presenting options A title can start gathering the currently available purchasing options by calling the XOnlineGetPurchaseOptions(TID, UID).     These functions gather the title s subscription or one-time purchase options, including price in the user s local currency, any applicable taxes, and adjusted for any special deals applicable to the title and/or user.   Due to the round-trip operation, this routine operates asynchronously using the XOnlineTaskContinue() API, and continues until options are retrieved from the server. Need to determine the metadata these APIs return. Should we differentiate between subscription and one-time purchase data?  Do these need to come from different services?  Checking permissions Only certain users will have the ability to add (and remove) purchase options from an account.    For instance, members of a family account may not have permissions to add additional charges to the family s billable account if they aren t the direct owner.  Actually, will we support anyone adding charges to a non-billable account?   Not doing so would simplify things.. To sign up for a service, the user needs access to the  UserAccountMaintenance  service.   Titles potentially wishing to add (or remove) subscriptions to a user s account should include this service in the list of services passed to XOnlineLogon().   Users not authorized for this service do not have the necessary permissions to add and remove subscriptions to their account, as would be the case of guest or child accounts.    This may not be a separate service, but simply a flag included within the ticket to the main xbox service. Making a purchase When the user chooses to make a purchase, this results in a call to XOnlinePurchase(), specifying the appropriate SKU gathered from XOnlineGetPurchaseOptions().   The purchasing operation happens asynchronously -- the API will either return an error or a PENDING status code, along with a handle to continue monitoring status using calls to XOnlineTaskContinue().     When the purchase has cleared with user s billing account (i.e. the charge has been placed on the user s credit card) the status changes to COMPLETE, DENIED or an error, depending on the situation.   After the next call to XOnlineLogon(), XOnlineHasPurchase() will return the updated purchase status accordingly. Checking for existing purchases A title (or the dashboard) can check for a purchased item by calling XOnlineHasPurchase().    This is documented in the Billing Authorization API spec (to be written).

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Xbox Online SPS Service Provider (Callback) Server Title _PID_HLINKSXbox Online SPS Service Provider (Callback) Server Ben Zotto Normal Ben Zotto Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags PersonName http://www.microsoft.com MonthXbox Online SPS Service Provider (Callback) Server 2/08/2002  Program Management  Development Ben Zotto  Test Jay Patterson  Operations  TCRs  Usability  International / Localization  Spec Status DRAFT  Document Authors Ben Zotto  Overview Our billing back-end is integrated with the Subscription Platform Group s (SPG) billing system, called the Subscription Platform Service (SPS).  The integration is accomplished by our service acting in two roles: that of a Tenant, and that of a Service Provider.  Tenants of the SPS are front-end systems which pass along purchase and account management requests on behalf of end-users.  Service Providers are deemed to be the entities which perform the act of provisioning, deprovisioning on behalf of SPS.   This distinction comes from the separation between the act of purchasing something (charging money for it), and the act of provisioning it (actually giving the user what they paid for).  SPS separates these acts sharply in SPS 2.5, and doing so provides a flexible and wide-reaching billing and fulfillment platform. Because the Xbox Online service both initiates purchases and is responsible for providing users with what they purchase, we must act as both Tenant and Service Provider.  Details of how we (and title developers) use the Tenant entry points to the system are straightforward are detailed in the  Xbox Online Billing and Offerings API Dev Spec .  Tenant functionality in the datacenter is represented by the XBOS and XUAC front-door servers. In order to act as a Service Provider (SP), we must also provide a  callback  server (XCBK), which services asynchronous requests from SPS for provisioning, deprovisioning, and other account management.  Because we act as both the Tenant and SP, we don t necessarily enforce the sandboxing of the two, and this Dev Spec will cover both the functioning of the XCBK server, and how its role interacts with the role of our front-door servers. Lay of the Land in Datacenterville The XCBK server is mandated to be a SOAP server, exposing an XML Web Service with methods that SPG defines.  SOAP is essentially HTTP, with formatted XML as a payload, used to make lightweight remote procedure calls. SPG mandates that the SP web service be available only via HTTPS (SSL encrypted).  The URL for the service provider looks something like this:  HYPERLINK "https://zotto/xcbk/sprov.asmx"  https://zotto/xcbk/sprov.asmx The WSDL contract for the service is available by following the service URL with the following query:  HYPERLINK "https://zotto/xcbk/sprov.asmx?WSDL"  https://zotto/xcbk/sprov.asmx?WSDL Further details about Provisioning and the ISvcProvider interface (SP) are available on SPG s intranet site, at:  HYPERLINK "http://spg/sps/SPS%2025%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.htm"  http://spg/sps/SPS%2025%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.htm under the  Provisioning  area. As SPS s datacenter is not contained within our own, the current plan involves using a VPN connection between datacenters to allow them to access our XCBK server. XBOS, XCBK and How Provisioning Works For Us This section describes the interactions between XBOS, SPS, XCBK and external entities (CSRs, etc) in terms of who purchases, provisions, and tracks what in the Xbox Online Universe.  Definitions OfferID An Xbox Online representation of an offering (a DWORD) Billing Offer GUID s representation of a single subscription  (a GUID) Service Component ID Within the SPS system, one can define a single subscription to  contain any number of  service components  (things to be  provisioned as part of the subscription). Here in Xbox Online world, however, we (almost always) have a one-to-one mapping between Service Component ID and Billing Offer GUID (a GUID) Service Instance ID The unique ID of an instance of a service component. (16-character opaque string) Subscription ID The unique ID of an instance of an entire subscription. (16-character opaque string) Provisioning/Deprovisioning The actual act of granting and removing user rights to an offer within our UODB.  (An addition/update to the user subscriptions table). Purchase Purchase on the front door will involves translating an Offer ID into a Billing Offer GUID for a call to SPS s PurchaseOffering method.  The PurchaseOffering method does not do provisioning implicitly.  This must be done by an explicit call to ProvisionService.  However, we trump this to avoid asynchronous provisioning and immediate provision the offer (put it in the UODB) on behalf of the user. The PurchaseOffering call returns to us with information about the service component(s) that need to be provisioned and the service instance IDs that SPS has associated with it/them.  SPS also hands back a subscription ID as a way of tracking the entire subscription.  Remembering that we maintain an essentially one-to-one relationship between offers, services, and subscriptions, we record the subscription ID and the service instance ID along with the offer ID in the user subscriptions table. We do, however, call ProvisionService redundantly, because we want SPS to record that the service has been provisioned.  This will, of course, generate an extraneous call to the XCBK server, which is unavoidable for now.  The motivation for having SPS record the provision will become apparent soon. This is done by filling in an XML fragment using some of the data that we got back from SPS.  We send along the original data, plus some PUID/passport name information to the Provision call, and we note in the <details> element that the service has already been provisioned. ( ALREADY PROVISIONED [XBOS] While our current (final?) DRM story implies that we only need to generate dummy provision calls for subscriptions (as opposed to content), there are plausible business (customer support) reasons for doing so in all cases.  This allows us the safety net of being able to deprovision even content access later via CSR. Cancel Cancellation at the XBOS front door is simple.  We simply up the subscription ID in the user subscriptions table, and request a cancellation for that subscription ID. Because all subscriptions will be noted as Provisioned (see above), SPS will always automatically generates a Deprovision call.  This will be caught by XCBK (see cancel description there). Note that no changes to the UODB need to happen at XBOS for a cancellation Because of the way that we have set up dummy provisioning calls, ALL purchasing and cancellation requests, both from XBOS and from external sources (CSRs) will come through the SP interface here. Purchase On receiving a provision request, we first need to see whether this is a dummy notification.  If it is, the <details> field should have that indicated via a note-to-self (see above).  In this case, we simply drop the request, no-op, and return OK. Purchase requests from other, external entities, however, will be legitimate and will need to be handled.  This is done in the following manner: Get service component ID from the request, and use the UODB to translate this into an Offer ID. Use the PUID and service instance ID, and call SPS GetSubscriptions  to retrieve the corresponding subscription ID. Store the set (offer id, subscription ID, service instance ID) in the UODB s user subscriptions table.  This constitutes all the information needed to deprovision, even if the cancel is called from XBOS. Cancel A deprovision request on the callback server can be generated from anywhere.  The following process happens: Use service component ID to retrieve Offer ID from the UODB Search the user subscriptions table by offer ID, user, and service instance ID Mark that offer as cancelled. ISvcProvider Methods SPG (not us) defines the remote methods that we expose for Provisioning. The SPS 2.5 system requires the presence of six methods.  These are outlined below only in the context of how we use them; for the complete and full definitions of the APIs and their use, please see the Subscription Platform Kit (SPK) documentation (spk.chm) and the specs/docs mentioned in the previous section. ProvisionService / DeprovisionService These will perform as described above in terms of Purchase and Cancel.  In our world, the terminology is virtually synonymous. EnableService / DisableService These will be implemented strictly as SPS intends; flipping the subscription_status ID to the appropriate state, per their definitions. ValidateProvisioningData Because we do not use provisioning to do  resource reservation  currently, this API should always succeed.  May do a sanity check to ensure that the service component ID requested is actually in existence, but that may just be a waste of cycles. CheckProvisioningStatus At the moment, we do not do provisioning for things that are   through SPS, at least in the sense they intend.  This API will thus be another no-op.

XCBK does not fall into the service consolidation plan,  it is a soap service that is called by the billing partner backend. M1 only covers consolidation of front-doors and stateful services. In addition to the technical differences the billing servers must be isolated for security reasons. I currently do not have specifications for configuration database changes to XCBK so those are not yet covered in this test plan. M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Test review required before reaching this milestone.. Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code is already written but not run against M1 installed code. Test Stress Code Complete  This service has passed and exceed stress numbers for Tsunami. New perf requirements are needed for this milestone. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service and approved.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals Discuss your test goals for each milestone.   Example:  M1 Milestone: I will continue to run regression using the already completed test code as well as light stress to simulate partial service load. There may be more config database testing requirements but since a no spec is available this is TBD. M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals M1 Milestone: It is not a goal to heavily stress the performance of XCBK as it s current performance far outstrips any kind of load that would be required by even magnitudes more account operations from our billing partner. M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents There are no existing specifications for the callback server. Functional Testing Summary The callback server is called by the billing partner through a secure soap protocol. It provides the provision and deprovising accounts based on actions and billing states in a remote system. The bulk of testing involves creating accounts in all of the various states and then enumerating the APIs on the callback server to modify the account status. One the account has been modified the database is queried to check the consistency of the modification. Test Case Matrix New test cases will be available once a the configuration database changes for this service are defined by the development team.

Example: M1 Milestone: The XMAC and XKDC services are being combined into one server cluster.  There will be minimal changes to the service code itself but there will be big changes in the way configuration is being loaded.  With the addition of the configuration database, the new combined XMAC/XKDC service will load its configuration information from a configuration database instead of a local initialization file.  The XMACS and XKDC components will also now rely on the XMOSS server to load its encrypted service keys.  With out this XMOSS service, the XKDC and XMACS will fail to initialize properly.  This test plan will document my approach to make sure these changes will be well tested for eventual production deployment. M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals Discuss your test goals for each milestone.   Example:  M1 Milestone: Since my server is being rewritten from C++ to C#, my goal is to use 90% of my existing tests by re-running them against the front door and develop 10% new cases to that will talk directly to the SQL server.  Rerunning existing tests against the front door will validate that there has been no behavior change in server since the previous release.  The new test cases being developed for the SQL server will provide an additional level of coverage since the rewrite now depend more heavily on data being stored in SQL vs. caching in the front door.  I will also be writing new test cases to validate the new configuration settings being pulled from the configuration database vs. the previous local initialization file method. M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals Clearly state the dividing line between what you will be covering and what you won t be covering for each milestone. Example:  M1 Milestone: It is not a goal to run a complete set of statistics API s through both the front doors and the INH server.  90% of my tests will talk directly to the in-house server providing the highest level of direct API coverage for the statistics service.  Only basic integration tests will be run against the front door to validate that the front door will act as a reliable pass through mechanism.  Only ELO leader boards will be tested in conjunction to the other mentioned integration tests on the front doors since these leader boards perform front door cache specific operations. M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents Reference any documents (via its path in CoreXT) that relate to your test plan. Example:  If this is the arbitration test plan, then referencing (as follows) the arbitration dev spec would be useful.   Xbox Live Arbitration Development Spec ($corext\private\doc\server\arbitration) Functional Testing Summary Write a summary for your test methodology as it relates to the complete test matrix. Example: The Arbitration server has four main APIs that control the registration, time extension, debugging, and result reporting for game sessions.  Functional testing will strive to test the matrix surrounding this API set. Test Case Matrix [DELETE THIS LINE: This section is broken up into what new test cases will need to be written for this milestone vs. what test cases you will be reusing from previously developed tools.] New Test Cases per Milestone M1 Milestone:  Insert new test case matrix here. M2 Milestone: TBD Existing Reusable Test Cases GetPuidFromXName GetPuidFromXName resolves a name into a puid. On failure it returns zero. Positive cases: GetPuidFromXName.P.Mainline Desc: Call GetPuidFromXName for a user  Verify: Make sure the call passes and the returned puid matches.. Negative cases: GetPuidFromXName.N.BadName Desc: Call ProvisionService for an unknown user  Verify: Make sure the call fails. GetPuidFromXName.N.BlankName Desc: Pass in a blank user name. Verify: Make sure the call fails. GetPuidFromXName.N.LongName Desc: Pass in a long (65K) user name. Verify: Make sure the call fails. GetAccount GetAccount retrieves information (banned state, must change tag, etc.) about a user from the UODB. This API is also used to verify ModifyAccount functionality. Positive cases: GetAccount.P.Mainline Desc: Call GetAccount for a user  Verify: See if the results match data stored in the UODB. Negative cases: GetAccount.N.BadPuid Desc: Call GetAccount for an unknown user  Verify: Make sure the call fails. GetRelatedAccounts Users under the legal age requirements get two puids associated with their account: their own   the user puid, and an owner puid that s supposed to represent their parent or guardian. This API resolves an owner puid into a user puid. Positive cases: GetRelatedAccounts.P.Mainline Desc: Call GetRelatedAccounts for a user that has an associated owner. Verify: See if the results match data stored in the UODB. GetRelatedAccounts.P.SingleUser Desc: Pass in a puid of a user that does not have an owner (ie. The user is his own owner) Verify: See if the results match data stored in the UODB. Negative cases: GetRelatedAccounts.N.BadPuid Desc: Call GetRelatedAccounts for an unknown user  Verify: Make sure the call fails. GetTransactions Retrieves the first n transactions that haven t been processed (mail hasn t been set) yet. Transactions are logged by UACS and XBOS whenever a user purchases or cancels something. GetTransactions is used in conjunction with EmailsSent: GetTransactions returns a list of transactions, and then EmailsSent is used to let CUST know which emails have been sent. Positive cases: GetTransactions.P.Mainline Desc: Call GetTransactions, request 10 returns Verify: Make sure the call passes and the data returned matches the state of the UODB. GetTransactions.P.Zero Desc: Call GetTransactions, request 0 transactions Verify: Make sure the call passes and the data returned matches the state of the UODB. Negative cases: GetTransactions.N.TooMany Desc: Call GetTransactions, request 1001 transaction (there is a server limit of 1000 transactions per call). Verify: Make sure that the right amount of data is returned EmailsSent Once confirmation emails have been sent, the CUST server needs to be notified of the changes. CUST will then mark these entries as  email sent , and they won t be returned by GetTransactions any more. This API will be tested by executing a set of GetTransactions   EmailsSent   GetTransactions. Positive cases: EmailsSent.P.Mainline Desc: Call EmailsSent with 10 puids. Call GetTransactions, make sure that the emails that have been sent are not returned by GetTransactions. Verify: Make sure the call passes and the data returned matches the state of the UODB.  Negative cases: EmailsSent.N.BadServiceIDs Desc: Call EmailsSent, with 10 puids, but get service IDs wrong. Verify by using GetTransactions. Verify: Make sure the call fails and that subsequent GetTransactions calls return the same data set since it was not processed.  ModifyAccount ModifyAccount is related to GetAccount: it allows the CSRs to lock out an account, voice ban it, or force a name change. This API will be tested by calling the following APIs: CreateOwnerAccount   ModifyAccount   GetAccount   custom UODB query that simulates GetAccount. The results of the last two operations should match. Positive cases: ModifyAccount.P.Mainline Desc: Call ModifyAccount multiple times with various flags set or cleared. Verify: Look up accounts in the UODB, make sure that the right flags have been modified. Also verify using GetAccount.  Negative cases: ModifyAccount.N.BadPuid Desc: Call ModifyAccount with a bad puid. Verify: Make sure the call fails.  ResetPassword Resets the user s password. Due to the nature of this API, it is difficult to test whether the password change is successful. Therefore we only rely on the return code. Client side testing should be able to test this API to the full extent. Positive cases: ResetPassword.P.Mainline Desc: Reset the user s password. Verify: Make sure the call passes.  Negative cases: ResetPassword.N.BadPuid Desc: Call ResetPassword with a bad puid. Verify: Make sure the call fails.  GetSubscriptionCodeStatus Subscription codes are used by UACS in the process of creating accounts. This API returns all relevant information concerning a sub code. This includes flags that are set if a sub code is valid, used too many times, has been used at all, who was the last user that used it, and when it was last used. The tests listed here rely on UACS to create accounts and use up vouchers. Positive cases: GetSubscriptionCodeStatus.P.Mainline Desc: Create a new sub code with a use count of 2. Call GetSubStatus to make sure that it s valid and unused. Use it once, call GetSubStatus and verify data. Repeat once again. Make sure that the sub code is valid, but used up after the second call. Verify: Make sure the call passes.  Negative cases: GetSubscriptionCodeStatus.N.BadVoucher Desc: Call ResetPassword with a bad voucher. Verify: Make sure the call fails.  GetSubscriptionCodeStatus.N.EmptyVoucher Desc: Call ResetPassword with a blank voucher. Verify: Make sure the call fails.  GetSubscriptionCodeStatus.N.LongVoucher Desc: Call ResetPassword with a long (66,000 character) voucher. Verify: Make sure the call fails.  Stress Testing [DELETE THIS LINE: There is no official M1 milestone stress testing requirements for this milestone, however, if your area of ownership has minor changes you can choose to take on additional stress work in this milestone to make your life easier in the next milestone.] Example: M1 Milestone: No stress testing will be performed for this milestone due to the functional changes being validated in this timeframe. Example: M1 Milestone: Since minimal changes are being performed for this milestone, even though there is no official stress testing requirement, it is my goal to establish a TPS baseline for this version of the code.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Title _PID_HLINKSMichael Fisher Normal.dot Michael Fisher Microsoft Office WordCust   API Changes for Tools Test Plan PM:  Shaykatc Dev:  Ramhar Test:  Mifish Introduction Whenever new functionality is introduced to allow users to provide content for use in the Xbox Live system, new enforcement methods must be created to allow us to appropriately deal with inappropriate content.  With the addition of user supplied gamercard mottos on Xbox.com and user created personal gamer pictures when Cyclops is released, it is therefore necessary that we have the ability to remove inappropriate content and prevent offenders from immediately repeating the offense via a temporary communications ban. Cust API Tools Additions Dev Spec:  HYPERLINK "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Tools/Community%20Management/CM_ChangesForVision.doc"  http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Tools/Community%20Management/CM_ChangesForVision.doc QuickEnforcement Data Flow Model (inc. Cust):  HYPERLINK "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Tools/Community%20Management/XenonQuickEnforcementsDataFlow.vsd"  http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Tools/Community%20Management/XenonQuickEnforcementsDataFlow.vsd The 2 new methods will require new test cases to cover them.  The change to ModifyAccount() is already covered by existing test cases. API Changes & Test Cases The following 3 methods and corresponding test cases are being added: New Method:  public uint RemoveGamerPicture(ulong puid, out string errorString) Purpose:  Remove an inappropriate gamer picture, which will now default to the public gamer tile.  Can only apply to Silver, Gold, and Gold Migrated users.  XboxCom users don t have Xboxes, thus no camera and the camera doesn t work on the Xbox 1. Positive: Verify valid puid with personal gamer picture present and verify 1) success result and 2) Storage server confirms picture the picture isn t there any longer. Verify valid puid with no personal gamer picture present Negative: Verify valid puid with no access to Storage server Verify min/max puid values Verify random valid but non-existent puid New Method:  public uint SetUserMotto(ulong puid, string newMotto, out string errorString) Purpose:  Change an inappropriate user motto to something different.  Applies to all users types. Positive: Verify valid puid with valid gamer motto string  Verify valid puid with valid gamer motto string with Unicode string (JP, CH, etc.) Negative: Verify valid puid with invalid gamer motto string using characters like:  Verify valid puid with empty gamer motto string Verify valid puid with over-sized (22 or more chars) gamer motto string Verify valid puid with no access to Stats server Verify min/max puid values Verify random valid but non-existent puid The following API is being modified: Modified Method:  public uint modifyAccount(ulong puid, bool isLockedOut, bool isVoiceBanned, bool isNicknameBanned, bool mustChangeXName, out string errorString) Purpose:  The  Voice Ban  flag is being repurposed to become a more general  Communications Ban  to disable all voice, video, photo, messages, and text communications.  When an inappropriate photo, voice, text, etc. message has been sent, the sending account will be temporarily banned from all forms of communicating.  The first time an account is banned, the ban lasts for 1 day.  A second ban lasts for 7 days.  All subsequent bans last for 14 days.  If an account is already in a communications ban state and isVoiceBanned is set to true, calling this method does nothing, however if isVoiceBanned is set to false it will set the VoiceResumeDate field in the user s account to  1 minute ago now , lifting the ban. Existing ModifyAccount tests already cover this functionality.  No new test cases are required by this change to the API. gd8Z& gd8Z&

If the CSR moved the user from silver to gold, we need to have a way of knowing that the user s tier has changed, so that we can start treating them as a gold user. In a meeting with Arun Sacheti, from MPG, it was suggested that we can change our design (from Xbox 1) such that rather than having a single SCG component ID for all of our offers, we model each of our tiers with different component IDs.  This would have the effect of giving us a callback whenever a user s component ID changed. Since we don t want to receive a deprovision call from the source tier when moving to the destination tier, we should also place all of our offers into the same  component class.   This will ensure that the user being moved from silver to gold will create a single callback to Live with the information that gold service should be provisioned. SCG Account State Component ID1 Component ID2 Component Class "Light-weight" account in SCG with no associated subscription Bronze SCG account with a subscription to silver (monthly, yearly, etc) Silver SCG account with a subscription to gold (monthly, yearly, etc) Issue: I m not sure how to add existing Xbox 1 offers to this chart. We already store the component ID associated with the offer in t_offers.  Since it is possible to have multiple component IDs associated with an offer, and since we want to simplify our offer modeling of old Xbox offers, we will keep the old component ID to mean  access to Live .  Silver and gold offers will also have additional component IDs to distinguish them.  A schema change will be needed to associated a single offer with multiple component IDs. When we receive a callback from SCG, we will be given the component IDs of the offer the user is being moved into, as well as the  instance ID  associated with the user s subscription.  This instance ID is associated with a user in the t_subscriptions table, and so we will be able to change the user s subscription accordingly.  The next time the user logs on, their new subscription should take effect and grant them the new set of privileges associated with the change. Live Service APIs Public APIs for Game Developers If needed:  Describe any client APIs exposed to game developers here. Also call out what old Xbox APIs are deprecated or replaced by these new APIs. Private APIs for Guide XOnlinepSetUserSettings2 This SPI updates a user s tier, userflags, and set of privileges on the server, by calling the uacs method SetUserSettings2. XBOXAPI DWORD WINAPI XOnlinepSetUserSettings2(     const XUID *pUserXuid,     WORD bTier,     WORD dwUserFlags,     const DWORD *rgPrivileges,     PXOVERLAPPED pXOverlapped     ); Client Side Caching and Throttling If needed:  Describe any client side caching or throttling that will get implemented. Public Web Service APIs for Partners If needed:  Describe any SOAP widgets that need to get developed to expose public SOAP APIs to web partners. Private Web Service APIs for Xbox.com If needed:  Describe any SOAP widgets that need to get developed to expose private SOAP APIs to Xbox.com. Such widgets should generally not need to exist except for cases when extreme caching is required. Database Schema Information on database schema to support tiers and privileges can be found in the  HYPERLINK "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Developer/Xe%20Authorization%20Dev%20Spec.doc" Xe Authorization Dev Spec Server Components Repeat this section for any new server side component that needs to get developed. Design SetUserSettings2 The purpose of this API is to allow the launcher to set up a user in a specific way, usually to be used when testing out changes to a user s privileges. The API will take the user s puid, and will allow changing the tier, the userflags, and allow fine-grained control over each privilege. The p_xuacs_set_user_privileges sproc will specifically grant/deny the privileges specified in the request, thereby overriding any tier/subscription, parental controls, or free weekend type settings. This API can only be called by the Dash TitleID. Issue: Once this API has been called, there is no way to revert the user back to observe normal tier/subscription, parental controls, or free weekend type settings. Is that a problem? Wire Protocol This section will describe the wire protocol of any/all API s that have changed in Xenon.  These wire protocols may fall out of date over time to see the latest uacs protocol definitions, look in UacsProtocol.cs. SetUserSettings2     public class SetUserSettings2Request : XRLObject2     {         public ulong    userPuid           =0;        // user we're talking about                  public ushort   tier               =0;        // the new tier of the user                  public ushort   userFlags          =0;        // the new user flags                      [WireInfo(ArraySize=XOn.PRIVILEGE_DWORD_LENGTH)]                     public uint[]   userPrivileges;               // the new user privileges                  //         // Helpers for client & widget code         //         public string Xrl         {             get { return "/xuacs/SetUserSettings2.ashx"; }         }     } Configuration Parameters Describe any configuration settings this component uses. Describe the default value as well as any value that will have TestNet, PartnerNet, or CertNet values different than those used in Production. Management Commands Describe any management commands this component exposes. Think about how OPS is going to manage this server component and what an OPS person might want to do with such a live running server component (flushing a cache, etc ). Avoid creating management commands that simply return a number. You should use performance counters for that. Events If needed: In general, the standard events defined in xeventids.h should be used for all events. If any special events are thrown, they should be described here. Remember, event texts should contain as much detail as possible including the Call Stack, the SG Auth Info of the caller and even the full incoming wiredata payload (using the ToString() function of WireData). If the XOC wakes you up at 3 am and tells you this event fired in the production data center, you should have enough info in the event text to help you determine what to do next. Performance Counters Describe the performance counters this component exposes. In general, we at least want a total counter and TPS counter per API as well as a total counter and TPS counter per title per API. This enables us to evaluate which title is abusing which API at what rate. Also, if the cost of carrying out the API call is drastically different depending on the parameters of the API, then you should create another per title per API total counter and TPS counter that more accurately reflects the   of the API call. For example, if the storage server can handle 1000  ReadData  API calls per second when 0 bytes is read, but can only handle 500  ReadData  API calls per second when 20000 bytes is requested in each read, then you should create a counter that gets incremented by (1 + bytesRead / 20000) for each ReadData API call. Under the performance category  Xuacs:SetUserSettings2 , the following counters are created: Counter Name Description SetUserSettings2 requests/sec SetUserSettings2 requests per second SetUserSettings2 total Total SetUserSettings2 error events recorded in the the current AppDomain SetUserSettings2 failures/sec Number of unsuccessful results returned by SetUserSettings2 per second in the current AppDomain SetUserSettings2 total failures Total number unsuccessful results returned by SetUserSettings2 in the current AppDomain  SetUserSettings2 avg. Execution time Average time taken to Execute SetUserSettings2 Describe the log lines this component writes out. This should be as simple as cut and pasting the  XomLog  lines in any C# code (assuming you named all your variables an easy to understand name). In general, a log line should be generated for each API call. The log line doesn t necessarily need to contain all the parameters of the API call, but should contain the most important ones. Read the LogPrinciples.doc document for more rules to follow. SetUserSettings2 511|SetUserSettings2| <UserPUID>|<UserFlags>|<Tier>|<Privileges>|<HResult> Setup If needed:  Anything special about how this component is setup should be described here. Web Client Components for Xbox.com If needed: Xbox.com dev team only. Describe the HTML structure, the Java scripts and the CSS structure used.  Interesting Test Cases If needed: If you have any non-obvious test cases that you would like the test team to test, mention it here. Security If needed: Most of the components in our system are already protected from massive internet hacking and DoS attacks by the SG and the KDC. But you should always assume a few good hackers can send any data they want through the SG. Think about what these hackers can do to this feature and these components. In general, you should only trust the SG auth data retrieved from the SG, and not blindly trust any data sent in the wire data. You should use the SG auth data to verify any assumptions that should be true. In general, you should never allow a request to directly modify user information without using SG auth data to verify that you are really talking to said user. Production Upgrade  If needed:  Think about how the production site will need to get changed to support this new feature. Does any data need to get migrated? What migration scripts will need to get written? Can it be done without any downtime? Describe how new bits for this feature can be deployed without downtime if it is possible. Reporting If needed:  This section should detail what aspects of this feature will be reported upon. The reporting service will be responsible for gathering data from each feature and displaying it in a consistent way, however each feature and service needs to think about what data is important to report on, and how that data will be made accessible to the reporting service.  What databases, logs, performance counters will need to be analyzed? How frequently will reports be relevant?  Will this feature/service be doing any aggregations that the reporting service can use? TitleMgr Impact If needed:  Think about whether any titlemgr changes are needed for this feature. Whenever a new title is added to the system, does anything need to be done for that title? Tools If needed:  Think about how OPS is going to run this feature after it is deployed. What tools will they need? Is there any cleanup needed on and database tables? Are any tools needed to migrate the data from one machine to another? Is this a valid scenario for the feature? Microsoft Confidential. Unpublished work.   Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

This work has not been clearly defined so that is not yet reflected in this test plan. M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals M1 Milestone:  It is a goal of this milestone to verify base functionality against the new test environment. Once development has specified configration database changes to this server new test scenarios will be generated to validate those new settings and operation. M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals M1 Milestone:  It is not a goal to validate operation with SPS. Actual offers are not tested, all offers are generated in code.  M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents Functional Testing Summary The billing server is tested by first creating a large permuted set of test offers covering all offer combinations. These are then run through a full set of functional tests with different types of users in different countries.

This test plan will cover only BOTD scheduling. Most of the testing will take place on a PC that connects to the Banner Server rather than a Xenon client.  Eventually the tests will be expanded to run on the Xenon platform. The client testing will be done by the client UI team. Related Documents The specification for this feature can be found here (  HYPERLINK "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Xbox.com%20and%20XPA/M3%20Specs/BOTD/Xenon%20Banner%20Of%20The%20Day.doc" \o "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Xbox.com%20and%20XPA/M3%20Specs/BOTD/Xenon%20Banner%20Of%20The%20Day.doc"  http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Xbox.com%20and%20XPA/M3%20Specs/BOTD/Xenon%20Banner%20Of%20The%20Day.doc Test Goals Overview: The test goals are to test the XBOS server APIs that allow banner URLs to be retrieved from the product database based on a specific schedule.  In general, the goals are: Verify that the XRL correctly accepts and returns information Verify that the API returns the correct information as requested Verify that scheduling works as intended. This applies to daily, monthly and weekly scheduling. Confirm that banners do not get displayed before or after the intended display times.  Test Non-Goals It is not the goals of this testing cycle to test: That the URL of the banner actually works Anything related to the banner file   We don t verify that the width and height match up to the banner file size Any client functionality. For example, we don t verify that clicking on a banner shows you the offer or opens up a marketplace blade.  Test Setup The tests will be run using the ServerTestFramework under STFRunner. They will be part of the XBosTestV2 suite of tests.  In general the tests will take on the following form: Create Titles Create Offers for those titles Populate the banner list items by doing direct insert queries into the database Call the APIs Verify the results Cleanup the banners, offers and titles Functional Testing P_MainLine Functionality: The Mainline test verifies to see whether the XRL is correctly sending and receiving data. It does no data verification, it merely sees if the data can be serialized and deserialized correctly into the constituent classes. Verification: Verify that the data is correctly serialized and deserialized into the XRL objects. This is done twice   once for HotLists and once for BannerLists. P_BL_RetrieveBanners Functionality: Test to see whether a list of banners can be retrieved using the BannerList XRL request. This will create a list of banners and retrieve them. Verification: The test passes if the list of banners matches the banners we inputted at the start of the test. We also validate that the data we get back is the correct data according to what we entered. P_HL_RetrieveBanners Functionality: Test to see whether a list of banners can be retrieved using the HotList XRL request. This will create a list of banners and retrieve them. Multiple passes are made to test various filters for the API. At the start of the test we enter a number of banners which will then be filtered  Verification: The test passes if the list of banners matches the banners we inputted at the start of the test. We also validate that the data we get back is the correct data according to what we entered.  P_BL_ScheduleMonthly Functionality: Test to see whether the monthly scheduling of banners (BannerList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_HL_ScheduleMonthly Functionality: Test to see whether the monthly scheduling of banners (HotList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_BL_ScheduleWeekly Functionality: Test to see whether the weekly scheduling of banners (BannerList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_HL_ScheduleWeekly Functionality: Test to see whether the weekly scheduling of banners (BannerList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_BL_ScheduleDaily Functionality: Test to see whether the daily scheduling of banners (BannerList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_HL_ScheduleDaily Functionality: Test to see whether the daily scheduling of banners (HotList) works correctly.  Verification: The test passes if the banners returned are the expected banners for the time specified in the banner properties. P_MultiplePricingStructures Functionality: Offers can have multiple pricing structures. This test validates that all the pricing structures are correctly returned on a banner item.  Verification: The test passes if the correct number of pricing structures for the offer is returned and the information within those pricing structures is correct. P_NoBannersMatch Functionality: This test validates what gets returned when no banners match the current date/time combination.  Verification: The test passes if no banners are returned. P_StartEndDates Functionality: This test validates that banners that don t fall within the start-end dates don t get returned. Verification: The test passes if the banners that fall outside of the start/end date are not returned to the caller. P_DayRollover Functionality: This test validates that banners that don t fall within the start-end dates don t get returned. Verification: The test passes if the banners that fall outside of the start/end date are not returned to the caller. N_InvalidAuthData Functionality: This API should not succeed if the caller has invalid authorization data.  Verification: The test passes if the call fails due to invalid authorization data. Stress Testing Performance Testing Resource Requirements Test Complete Criteria Release Criteria All areas must pass 100% test cases before final release.

I would however like to look more into areas of testing that were only lightly addressed during the end of Tsunami. The areas that would benefit from more thorough testing are: minor accounts, queued ccounts, banned accounts and functional areas of web account linking.  M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals M1 Milestone: Maintanence of existing functional tests and adding new levels of depth to the test matrix around the areas of minor accounts, queued account and advanced account status. M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals M1 Milestone: It is not a goal of these test suites to validate SPS functionality. I have tried to make sure the tests can even run 100% complete under emulation. M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents Functional Testing Summary APIs are tested by creating an account, operating on the account and then either validating the account status by using another xonline API or by querying the database directly. A large majority of UACS test code requires the emulator to perform non-standard operations.  Test Case Matrix TBD once dev specs for the configuration database are released. New Test Cases per Milestone M1 Milestone: TBD M2 Milestone: TBD Existing Reusable Test Cases CreateOwner CreateOwner creates an account (in UACS terms, an owner and a user are now synonymous). In order to successfully create an owner, UACS must have valid billing information (CC type, CC number, CC expiration date, billing name and address, bank code, branch code, and check digits). Also, an owner must be at least 18 years old in order to set up a billing relationship and to accept terms of usage. Finally, the owner must choose a tag for himself. A list of non-valid tags can be found in t_forbidden_names. If all of the conditions have been met UACS enters a row in UODB.t_users, and returns the new owners PUID.  Positive cases: CreateOwner.P.Mainline Desc: CreateOwner with a standard owner (all values in range) Verify: Lookup owner in UODB based on PUID.  CreateOwner.P.Spam Desc: Test the *spam fields with values 0, 1, and 255 Verify: Make sure that the user has been created and that the spam fields match their requested values.

ReserveName ReserveName allows the client to test if a name has already been used. In case the name has been used or if it contains an unacceptable string, a sorted list of alternative names is returned. ReserveName takes the following parameters: machine PUID, country ID, user name, and the maximum number of alternate names to return. If the name is successfully reserved, an entry is added to t_user_names. A reservation typically expires in one hour.  Positive cases: ReserveName.P.Mainline1 Desc: Reserve an unused name (make sure the name is unused by looking it up). Verify: Service returns SUCCESS, name is reserved in t_user_names ReserveName.P.UsedName Desc: Reserve a used name; 10 max alt names Verify: XONLINE_S_ACCOUNTS_NAME_TAKEN and 10 alternate names ReserveName.P.UnacceptableName Desc: Reserve an unacceptable name; 10 max alt names Verify: XONLINE_S_ACCOUNTS_NAME_TAKEN and 10 alternate names ReserveName.P.VerifyValidity Desc: Request lots (let s say 1024) alt. names, and make sure all the returned user names are valid (can be created).

ReserveName.N.BadNames Desc: ReserveName with a bad user name ( 1digit bad  name  name name  , non alphanum characters) Verify: Lookup owner in UODB based on name (make sure that UACS didn t create him anyway) ReserveName.N.ReserveAndCreate Desc: Reserve a name, attempt to create an owner with the same name from a different Xbox before the reservation expires Verify:  Make sure that the call fails. ReserveName.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. SetUserPIN SetUserPIN sets the PIN code for the current user. The PIN code is used to set and retrieve user billing data through GetPaymentInfo and SetPaymentInfo. SetUserPIN is a simple API: it takes only the user s puid and the new PIN code. Results of the user PIN being changed are verified later using GetPaymentInfo and SetPaymentInfo. Due to the nature of these three functions, most if not all test cases will depend on more than just one call. Positive cases: SetUserPin.P.Mainline Desc: Set a user s PIN. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS. Additional verification can be done through GetPaymentInfo. Negative cases: ReserveName.N.BadPuid Desc: Set a non existent user s puid. Verify: Service fails SetUserPIN.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. GetPaymentInfo GetPaymentInfo returns current billing information to the user. This is a fairly straightforward API   all it does is lookup the user s records, fills out a structure and sends that back to the user. Therefore, there is only so much that can be done to test this API. I intend to conduct only minimal testing of GetPaymentInfo   one positive and two negative cases, and then test GetPaymentInfo by using it to verify returns from SetPaymentInfo. GetPaymentInfo only takes two arguments: the user PIN and the user puid. Positive cases: GetPaymentInfo.P.Mainline1 Desc: Retrieve payment information for an already created user. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS Negative cases: GetPaymentInfo.N.BadPuid Desc: Retrieve payment information for a non existent user puid. Verify: Service fails GetPaymentInfo.N.BadPIN Desc: Retrieve payment information for a user with a bad pin. Verify: Service fails GetPaymentInfo.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. SetPaymentInfo SetPaymentInfo sets user s billing information. The only requirement for this API is that it is passed in a valid puid and valid information (matching zip, city, state, etc).  All test cases will be additionally verifies using GetPaymentInfo. Positive cases: SetPaymentInfo.P.Mainline Desc: Set payment information for an already created user. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS SetPaymentInfo.P.VerifyCreatedOn Desc: Create an account, make sure the created date is set to the right date. Use SPI to modify the account. Verify that the created date has not changed. Negative cases: SetPaymentInfo.N.Mainline Desc: Set payment information for a non existing user. Verify: Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.MissingFields Desc: MissingFields with each of the following fields missing (multiple tests): gamertag firstname lastname street1 postalcode phoneprefix phonenumber cardholder cardnumber birthdate Verify: Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N,InvalidCC Desc: SetPaymentInfo with invalid CC information (type, number, or expiration date) Verify: Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.BadCountry Desc: SetPaymentInfo with a bad country ID, not found in t_countries Verify:  Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.LocationMismatch1 Desc: SetPaymentInfo with an invalid ZIP code, city pair Verify: Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.LocationMismatch2 Desc: SetPaymentInfo with an valid ZIP code, city pair, but with the wrong state Verify: Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.BadEmail Desc: SetPaymentInfo with an invalid email (no @, no .) Verify:  Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.BadPhone Desc: SetPaymentInfo with a bad phone number (011-012) Verify:  Service returns appropriate error code SetPaymentInfo.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. VerifyBillingPIN VerifyBillingPin lets the client test whether or not a user entered code matches the billing PIN. Currently, the billing pin consists of the last four digits of the user s credit card. If the server is set to autogenerate CC numbers, VerifyBillingPinTests will always pass. Positive cases: VerifyBillingPin.P.Mainline Desc: Create a new user. Verify his billing pin using the last four digits of the users CC. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS Negative cases: VerifyBillingPin.N.BadPuid Desc: Verify an unknown user s billing pin. Verify: Service fails VerifyBillingPin.N.BadPIN Desc: Attempt to verify a known bad PIN for a created user. Verify: Service returns PERMISSION_DENIED VerifyBillingPin.N.BadData Desc: Attempt to verify a malformed PIN (0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF and 0 0 0 0) for a created user. Verify: Service returns PERMISSION_DENIED VerifyBillingPin.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. SetUserSettings SetUserSettings sets si_ticket_flags in the UODB. The name might be a bit misleading since there is also a si_user_flags field in the UODB, but this API doesn t have anything to do with that field.  Positive cases: SetUserSettings.P.Mainline Desc: Create a new user. Set his user flag to 10. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS SetUserSettings.P.SetMultiple Desc: Create a new user. Set a single user s flags to a range of different flags (0, 1, 256, 32767, 32768, 65535). Verify: Service returns SUCCESS SetUserSettings.P.Mainline Desc: Create a new user. Set his user flag to 10. Verify: Service returns SUCCESS Negative cases: SetUserSettings.N.BadPuid Desc: Set an unknown user s flag. Verify: Call fails SetUserSettings.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error.

VerifyVoucher.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. SetUserAccountStatus This API is used to set certain key account properties such as whether or not the TOS have changed since the last time the user was logged on, whether or not the user needs to change his name (using ChangeGamerTag), as well as any bans or suspensions that are on record for an account. Results will be verified by UODB lookups and using TroubleshootAccount. Positive cases: SetUserAccountStatus.P.Mainline Desc: Set all the fields of the account status structure. Verify: A successful call. Verify settings by looking up data in the UODB. SetUserAccountStatus.P.RangeCheck Desc: Verify that extreme values do not trip up the service.

RestoreAccount.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. TroubleShootAccount TroubleshootAccount does the exact opposite of SetUserAccountStatus   given a user and machine puid, it returns account status information. The majority of tests for this API are done in SetUserAccountStatus tests   every SetUserAccountStatus test is verified using TroubleshootAccount. Positive cases: TroubleshootAccount.PMainline Desc: Create a user, and then try getting his account status. Verify: Data returned matches UODB contents. Negative cases: TroubleshootAccount.NBadPUID Desc: Try to get account status, send bad user puid. Verify: Call fails.

Negative cases: ClearSubscriptions.N.BogusAuth Desc: Call this API with bogus auth data Verify:  Make sure that the call fails with a generic error. VoucherTests These tests test the different voucher types.

VoucherTests.PSingleUse Desc: Create and account using the infinite use voucher. Verify: Call passes, make sure that the voucher is not expired after the use. LinkAccount PlinkAccount Desc: Link an owner account to a web ID. Verify: Query the database for all web mappings after test to ensure that new mappings are created for a linked user account. PlinkMinorAccount Desc: Link a minor account and ensure that it is linked the same as an owner account.  Verify:  Create an owner account along side the minor account and check the linked account values in uodb to ensure that all fields are filled out and not empty. NlinkAccountDataMismatch Desc: When linking the account provide non-matching billing PI info. Verify: Ensure that there are not any web account mappings in UODB after the account linking operations. Also ensure that an error is thrown on execution of this routine. ManualTests BillingQueue One aspect of UACS is better tested using manual tests: the billing queue. Should the connection between UACS and billing fail, all billing commands are automatically queued in the billing queue (uodb.t_user_billing_queue). Once the connection is restored, the queue pump should execute all queued commands. One way to test this functionality would be to turn the billing connection off via the xuacs.ini file (ConnectToBilling = No), and then execute the entire functional test suite. Make sure that the queue was filled, and then restore the connection. Make sure that the queue pump properly processes the queue.  SGAuth Disable fake SG in the test code. All positive test cases should fail   if they pass that would mean that UACS does not verify users and machines with the Security Gateway.  PUID Partitioning Verify that the algorithm used to partition t_users really works, and that the t_users tables contain approximately the same number of entries on all servers. A 15% difference will be tolerated. SetUserSettings2 Stress Testing M1 Milestone: Since minimal changes are being performed for this milestone, even though there is no official stress testing requirement, it is my goal to establish a TPS baseline for this version of the code.

Xbox 360 will support a player rating system based on reviews received form others.  The player rating is calculated and sorted in profile.  In the db there are 3 tables 1 stores all old Xbox 1 feedback, 2 stores all complaints received against a player and 3 all reviews. There are basically two major categories of reviews prefer or avoid. When every a player sends a review against a user the user is added to the players affiliates list and the users rating is updated. M1 Milestone: There will be minimal changes to Feedback service code which is due to the changes in the way configuration is being loaded. With the addition of the configuration database, the feedback service will load its configuration information from a configuration database instead of a local initialization file.  This test plan will document my approach to make sure these changes will be well tested for eventual production deployment. Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M4 Milestone: Implement new test cases for SendReview, SendComplaint and GetAggregate Api s ,  modify old test cases to verify that the feedback is  correct add to DB.  There will be additional test cases to make sure feedback decay works and the rating system works. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. Goals M2 Milestone:  1. Make sure that all positive test works and the server does not crash or log unexpected events for negative tests.  M1 Milestone: There is no change in the server hence all of my existing tests will run against the front Door. Rerunning existing tests against the front door will validate that there has been no behavior change in server since the previous release.  I will be writing new test cases to validate the new configuration settings being pulled from the configuration database vs. the previous local initialization file method. Non-Goals M2 Milestone:  The feedback formula has a lot of coefficients; we will not test for all possible combinations. All test cases will be tested for the default parameters.  No test cases will be implemented to make sure the distribution of users is correct, we assume that the formula is mathematically proven and it works M1 Milestone:  Related Documents Functional Testing Summary The Feedback server has 4 APIs that is used to report feedback regarding another user in a game session.  Functional testing will strive to test the matrix surrounding this API set.

M1 Milestone:  Configuration DB test cases:-   In this mile stone a central configuration store will be implemented as a relational tables stores in NPDB where All the server settings information will be stored. The feedback server needs to read configuration information from NPD instead of INI file.  On start up the server will load all configuration settings and save it locally in an XML file also the server will periodically poll NPDB for changes in configuration.  All configuration settings cannot be Automated I will be testing few manually. Automated test cases: Initialize_VerifyAuthData Using the management commands, verify that the VerifyAuthData setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. Initialize_SGMaxRetries Using the management commands, verify that the SGMaxReetries setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized. Initialize_SGTimeoutMicroSecs Using the management commands, verify that the SGTimeoutMicroSec setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized.

The goal is to provide a high degree of personalization and identity for the user s Xenon world. Technically, most Gamer Profile components consist of attribute values generated by the Xenon client, either automatically or by user selection, and stored on the Live Servers in association with the user s account information.    Additionally, activity-based data, such as titles most recently played, the amount of time online, gamer creds, etc. are also stored in association with the user, but are populated by Presence activity. Associated gamercard specs are here:  HYPERLINK "http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fxbxe%2fShared%20Documents%2fDigital%20Identity&View=%7b175ED0A5%2dCDE5%2d4AD1%2d9574%2dD6415576E260%7d"  http://team/sites/xbxe/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fxbxe%2fShared%20Documents%2fDigital%20Identity&View=%7b175ED0A5%2dCDE5%2d4AD1%2d9574%2dD6415576E260%7d Xenon M2 (Dec 04) The following items are shipped as part of the Xenon M2 release: XUserReadProfileSetting XUserWriteProfileSetting Profile settings front door apis (hosted by stats server) Offline profile settings Online profile settings Initial game setting IDs XPROFILE_GAMER_COUNTRY XPROFILE_GAMER_CRED XPROFILE_SETTING_CONTROLLER_INVERSION XPROFILE_SETTING_CONTROLLER_VIBRATION XPROFILE_TITLE_SPECIFIC1   XPROFILE_TITLE_SPECIFIC3 Xenon M3 (Apr 05) The following changes are slated for the Xenon M3 release: Profile permissions User per-title & summary activity Cred tracking Offline/online synchronization Family ID support Large item support (tiles, recordings, etc) Architecture and Description The architecture to support gamer profile is really complex, so I ve drawn a picture:  EMBED Visio.Drawing.11   Gamer profile data is populated from three sources:  Xbox.Com: users editing their profile online Xenon client: users editing their profile in the guide, or in game, as well as from synchronizing offline activity Presence: Online activity such as going online/offline, title being played, etc Gamer Profile data is consumed by: Xenon guide: users viewing their profile, profile of their friends/affiliates Xenon titles: retrieval of game settings   Xbox.com: users viewing their own profile, profile of their friends/affiliates/gamers from search results. Gamer Profile data is accessed via predefined property IDs.   Examples of such ids include CONTROLLER_INVERSION, RACING_TRIGGER_CONFIGURATION, RECENT_ACTIVITY, PREFERRED_LANGUAGE, etc.    There are also generic IDs for games to store their own settings, called GAME_SPECIFIC_PROFILE_1, GAME_SPECIFIC_PROFILE_2, etc.   The number of game specific profile settings are TBD.  Reading any of the non-game specific settings will return the user s global value for that setting.  For example, if the user tells the guide he prefers inverted controls, when a game reads CONTROLLER_INVERSION, it will return the user s selected preference.   The user may choose to override the setting for that specific game; the title should then call XUserProfileWrite(CONTROLLER_INVERSION) with the new value.   Any future calls by that specific title to retrieve the user s controller settings will return the new value, however any reads for that setting outside of that game will still return the configured global setting. Profile data is stored in UODB, in association with the gamer s account information.    A copy of this data is cached on the Xenon client. Gamer Profile APIs are hosted by the stats server.  Defaults, Globals and Title-Overrides Think of settings as having 3 layers: TITLE  - Titles can only change this layer GLOBAL  - The HUD can change this layer DEFAULT  - This layer is compiled in On request we look at the layers from top to bottom and return and first value we find.  The 3 layers only work on pre-defined setting ids, such as XPROFILE_SETTING_CONTROLLER_INVERSION. When the XUserReadProfileSettings API is called it first reads from the TITLE layer. If there's no setting yet, the API reads from the GLOBAL layer. If there's no GLOBAL settings yet then the API reads from the DEFAULT layer. When writing, the API always accesses the TITLE layer.  Only the internal SPI can write to the GLOBAL layer. The title-bit-buckets (XPROFILE_TITLE_SPECIFICx) are special in that they only exist at the TITLE level.  If a read of one of them fails then the API returns NO_VALUE. There are (n + 1) sets of these settings where n is the number of titles you've played.  There is 1 global set that we pull from when a title hasn't written their own override of the value.  Titles can only change their own overrides, but cannot modify the set that the HUD can. Title Activity The list of titles a user has played is stored with the user s client profile.   Each time a title and/or a profile is loaded, the current title is checked against the existing title list.  If this is the first time the title is played, the title is added to the list.   Otherwise, the play count for the existing title is incremented.    Any time an achievement is awarded, the title s record for the number of achievements and total cred is also updated.    The title s name is loaded from the title s compiled SPAC data file, in the user s current language.    If the user changes his language, the title s name is only updated when that title is loaded again.  Time played  (FEATURE CUT FROM XENON LAUNCH) One of the attributes tracked on a per-title basis is the number of hours played in a game title.   This value is the aggregate of two separate values: the number of minutes played offline, and the number of minutes played online.    Each value is calculated by keeping a time value in XAM memory, which represents the time that a new title starts, or when the value was last persisted to the MU.  The appropriate offline or online time played value for the title is persisted to the MU during the following events: MU is written to (i.e. a game is saved) SessionEnd() is called Title unloads The user logs on to, or logs off of, Live. The time played online is also tracked by the Presence server.   Presence will keep a record of the time when a user logs in to a title.   When the user logs off, the value for the time played online in user s online profile is updated with the new time.    Due to the fact that Presence will be better at tracking the actual time online, the server s version of this value will always overwrite the client s when synchronization occurs.    This allows us to maintain the most accurate representation of the time played online, while minimizing the number of database writes that occur on Live.  Title specific value We also expose a title-specific value for titles to show as another representation of the user s level, score, etc.    This value is set using XUserWriteProfileSetting with the id of XPROFILE_TITLE_SPECIFIC_SCORE, but stored and returned as a part of the metadata for each title value.  Title activity averages (FEATURE CUT FROM XENON LAUNCH) Shown with each user s title activity is the (approximate) average of all users on the service, i.e. average time played, average cred, average achievements, etc.    The average values will be stored in the same title table on the service, with a special user id of 0.   For the service-wide averages, the title id will also be 0.    These averages are calculated on a periodic interval (i.e. every 30 minutes) by a CRON plugin, which executes a stored procedure that figures out the average, and then writes the resulting value to each partition.   Because the values do not need to be exact, only the averages from a single partition will be calculated.    Also, in order to minimize the load, the calculation will be done against read-only replicas.  The average values are returned as a part of the recent title enumeration data.   Data synchronization Data synchronization takes place as a part of the following events: An offline profile is converted to online A user logs in A new title is loaded and one or more users are logged in A value is updated in the user s profile while online Changes to the live service are sent by XGI.   The call includes a list of global and title specific profile settings, any titles that have changed, and the time stamp from the last synchronization.   (note: the list of changes may be empty, however the SPI is still called to collect any changes made on the server).  The stats server writes these changes to the database (t_user_profile_settings and t_xprof_titles in uodb), and responds with any data that changed since the last timestamp provided by the client, along with the timestamp of the most recent change.   These changes and the new timestamp are written to the user s local profile.  Note: changes to the time spent online overall and for a specific title are not written to the server.   However, changes to this property are sent from the server and cached on the client.  Permissions There are 3 areas of permissions that can be controlled by the user: Games I ve played Service activity User created content (motto, greeting, etc) Each of these can be controlled by the owner using the following exposure levels: Everyone Friends and Affiliates Friends No one The exposure level for each of the areas is stored in profile settings as XPROFILE_PERMISSIONS.   The i_permission_flags column in npdb..t_profile_properties indicates what type each listed property is, dictating which permission should be used to control exposure of the property.  The ability for a user to view the profile of another user is controlled via the server implementation of XUserReadProfileSettings.    When the server receives this request, the target user s chosen exposure level is read, then compared against the exposure level of the given setting.   If the permissions require a friends and/or affiliates relationship, the stats server queries the presence server for the relationship between the two users.  Issue: Should the client send up an indicator if the user is friend?   This information is already known by the client, and will save the round-trip between the stats and presence server.   Can we do the same for affiliates?  If the requesting user is not allowed to view the data, the server returns a blank value with the source of PERMISSIOND_DENIED.

Database Schema Property IDs have a type definition associated with them.  This defines the type, access pattern and permissions associated with the property.    It is an error to attempt to set or get a property ID that doesn t exist in this table.  This description data is stored in NPDB. npdb..t_profile_properties I_property_id Property id vc_type Data type of the property vc_name Friendly name of the property vc_location Where the property value is stored I_permissions_flags set of flags that dictates the permissions associated with the property.   This includes flags to guide parental controls as well as exposure to other users Most profile data will be stored as opaque name / value pairs associated with the user and title (when applicable): uodb..t_user_properties bi_user_id User PUID I_title_id Title id for title-specific stuff (0 if global) I_property_id Property bin_value Property value The list of titles a user has played, and the metadata for each of those, is stored in a separate list (note: game stats and achievements are stored separately): uodb..t_xmsg_user_titles bi_user_id User PUID I_title_id Title id played dt_last_logon Last known time this title was played i_flags Flags used for messaging I_sessions_played Number of sessions played in this title I_minutes_played_online Number of minutes played online I_minutes_played_offline Number of minutes played offline I_title_score Some title-specific value Activity information is special; in order to track attributes like  time played last week , we track the recent activity on a per-day  basis.

Each setting to be updated is first enumerated and compared against the list of properties configured in NPDB.    If a property doesn t exist, or isn t one that can be set via this API (as dictated by the i_permissions_flags in t_profile_properties), the API returns in error. Otherwise, each of the settings to be set is consolidated into groups based on the vc_location field of t_profile_properties.   A single stored procedure call is then made to update the list of properties for each location, thus reducing the number of stored proc calls to the number of unique locations for the properties being set. Settings set via a specific (non-guide) title id are set for that specific title, that is, the title_id field of t_user_properites will contain the specific title id.  Title updates are written wholesale to the database, with the exception of the UserTitles.MinutesPlayedOnline field.   The client s value for this field is ignored.   The list is cumulative; any titles listed in the UserTitles array and not in t_user_titles are added, and any existing titles are updated. The API returns any settings and title values that have changed (have a dt_change_datetime value greater than the value specified by the client), as well as the latest Version values to be used in the next sync. /xstats/ReadSettings.ashx     // ReadSettings retrieves a list of settings for a list     // of users.     //     public class ReadSettingsRequest : XRLObject2     {         public uint TitleId;         public ulong UserId;                  [WireInfo(Max=XOn.XONLINE_MAX_SETTING_USERS)]         public uint ForUserIdsLen;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="ForUserIdsLen")]                 public ulong[] ForUserIds;                  [WireInfo(Max=XOn.XONLINE_MAX_SETTING_COUNT)]         public uint SettingIdsLen;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="SettingIdsLen")]                 public uint[] SettingIds;                  public string GetXRL()         {             return "/xstats/readsettings.ashx";         }              }     public class ReadSettingsResponse : XRLObject2     {         [WireInfo(Max=XOn.XONLINE_MAX_SETTING_COUNT)]         public uint SettingsLen = 0;                  [WireInfo(SizeParam="SettingsLen")]                 public UserSetting[] Settings = null;              }     The list of properties to be retrieved is validated against the cached list of properties from NPDB, then consolidated into groups to be retrieved, similar to SyncSettings     If the properties are being retrieved for an alternate user, and any of the requested properties have a non-zero value for i_permission_flags, the server also retrieves the value for XPROFILE_PERMISSIONS for each user in the ForUserIds array.    If the user s permission settings require friend or affiliate relationship, a request is made to the Profile server to check if the user is a friend or affiliate of each of the users in the ForUserIds array.   Any settings for which the user does not wish to expose the value, either due to lack of relationship or the exposure has been configured  to hidden from everyone, the value for the setting set to zero and the Source is set to XSOURCE_PERMISSION_DENIED.  /xstats/EnumeratePlayedTitles.ashx     public class EnumPlayedTitlesRequest : XRLObject2     {         public ulong UserId;         public ulong ForUserId;         public ulong StartingIndex;         public ulong MaxTitles;     }     public class EnumPlayedTitlesResponse : XRLObject2     {         UserTitle ServiceAverage;                  [WireInfo(Max=XOn.XONLINE_MAX_PLAYED_TITLE_COUNT)]         public uint TitlesLen;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="TitlesLen")]         public UserTitle[] TitlesPlayed;         [WireInfo(SizeParam="TitlesLen")]         public UserTitle[] TitleAverages;     } This returns an ordered list of titles from uodb..t_user_titles, ordered by the date last played, and starting at the index provided by the StartingIndex field in the request.   This API is limited to the Guide only. If the UserId in the request does not match the ForUserId value, the server first retrieves the setting for XPROFILE_PERMISSIONS for ForUserId.    If either the  service activity games played  permissions require a friend or affiliate, a request is set to the presence server to check the relationship of the UserId to the ForUserId. If the target user s permission does not allow for exposure for games they ve played, XONLINE_E_STAT_PERMISSION_DENIED is returned.      Issue: how is the title list impacted by  service activity  setting? Configuration Parameters Nothing special (at least not yet) Management Commands flushcache: flushes the cached copy of t_profile_properties.    This should be called whenever the list profile proerties change (i.e. a new title is posted). Events No new event ids are needed.   The standard logging mechanism (EventBuilder.LogEvent()) will be used to capture SG Info and API header information.   Performance Counters Setup Nothing special, we just need to ensure npdb gets initialized w/ any global and title-specific properties after each new rebuild. Web Client Components for Xbox.com If needed: Xbox.com dev team only. Describe the HTML structure, the Java scripts and the CSS structure used.  Interesting Test Cases If needed: If you have any non-obvious test cases that you would like the test team to test, mention it here. Security Users and title ids, when provided, will be verified against SG info.   Access permissions set by the user will be enforced by the front-door, so that other users will not be able to retrieve information for those users unless allowed by the owner of the data.  Production Upgrade  In order to have activity data reflect historical (i.e. xbox 1) activity, UODB will need to be pre-populated with user s data during the Xenon upgrade process.   It s TBD if we ll take on this chunk of work; just calling it out here for completeness. Reporting Data of interest here will be contained in the t_user_properties, t_user_activity and t_user_titles tables.   The data here can be translated by examining the metadata descriptions in npdb..t_profile_properties table. TitleMgr Impact TitleMgr will need to import title-specific properties into npdb..t_profile_properties.    These properties will be specified in the Game Configuration XML file generated via XLAST.    Tools None needed. Microsoft Confidential. Unpublished work.   Microsoft Corporation.

In addition more teams testing and negative test cases should be added to the test matrix. Additionally I would like to add more negative test cases and positive test scenarios for teams, arbitration, stats, and messaging integration. M2 Milestone: TBD Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone: TBD Goals M1 Milestone:  Full negative test cases for competitions. Full integration cases for teams, arbirtation  and messaging. Cleanup and maintainence of existing test cases. Additional test cases for configuration database.  M2 Milestone: TBD Non-Goals M1 Milestone:  It is not a goal of these tests to ensure the correct operation of the underlying query server.  M2 Milestone: TBD Related Documents Functional Testing Summary Competition is a complex service built upon a query wrapper server (query) and a scheduling server (cron). Competitions integrates with a number of other services including, messaging, teams, xcache and arbitration. Competitions is also extremely configuration from the publisher perpsective and in the future will require more permutations of additional publisher modeled datasets.

The goal is to provide a high degree of personalization and identity for the user s Xenon world. Technically, most Gamer Profile components consist of attribute values generated by the Xenon client, either automatically or by user selection, and stored on the Live Servers in association with the user s account information.    Additionally, activity-based data, such as titles most recently played, the amount of time online, gamer creds, etc. are also stored in association with the user, but are populated by Presence activity. Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M3 Milestone:  In this milestone I will be implementing positive and negative test cases for the API s sync/read Gamer Profile settings to test permission and parental controls along with sync/eum titles. No stress testing will be done M2 Milestone:  In this milestone I will be implementing positive and negative test cases for the API s set/read Gamer Profile settings. No stress testing will be done Goals M3 Milestone:  Write all positive and Negative test cases for Set/Read Profile Properties with permission. Write all positive and Negative test cases for Set/Read title list. M2 Milestone:  Write all positive and Negative test cases for Set/Read Profile Properties. Non-Goals Related Documents Gamer Profile Spec ($corext\private\doc\server\gamerprofile) Functional Testing The gamer profile server has two main APIs that control the setting and getting of gamer profile settings. Gamer profile settings are pre defined settings which have well-known ID s that never changes. Some setting could be overridden by titles.  Following list is not complete; items may be added or removed from the list. Set in Guide Override in title allowed Title Gamer Zone  Country Language Gender Greeting Controller Inversion Controller Vibration Title data1 Titledata2 Titledata3 Default game Character name Protocol Definatio User Settings This API takes is used to set and get properties and values for a user.    Each user setting to be set is enumerated and compared against the list of properties configured in NPDB.    If a user setting doesn t exist in NPDB the API returns in error.

Configuration The ASKdc utilizes the Xmgmt libraries for to produce logging records.  As a result, logging details can be managed from the XMGMT interface or askdc.ini file.  The logging area is: ASkdcLog This area only produces messages for logging purposes.  Other areas exists which provide more in-depth descriptions of errors.   Data Format Th ASKdc provides 2 different log line entries to express the flow of information.  These 2 areas can be identified by their prefix marker.  The information following this marker gives an indication of a successful or failed execution.  The 2 entries are: Authentication Request FORMAT:  REQ|name|PUID|flags|IP address|NT_Status|KerbErr|DWORD Status  Prefix log identifier for the authentication request.  This item appears just as presented. Name   The name presented in the Kerberos authentication request. PUID   This is the PUID assigned to the newly created machine account.  Note that if the process should fail before the PUID is assigned then this value will be 0. Flags   Process flags given for managing the acquisition of the principle.  This is the IP address of the Xbox that sent Kerberos authentication request. NT_Status   The processing path for attaining a requests principle returns an NT_STATUS value.  This value basically indicates that pass or fail, no unexpected errors occurred. KerbErr   The kerb error generated while building the principle.  Indicates which this was a successful request or that something failed for a specific reason. DWORD Status   This value is a bit string that contains details of what path was taken to create the machine account and an indication of where failures may be occuring.  The meaning of each bit is defined in section 4. Pre-PreAuth Data Management FORMAT:  PPA|NT_STATUS|Number of Rows Loaded|Total Number Loaded in Lifetime of Process|Time of Load(millisecs)|Percentage Full  Prefix log identifier for PPA data loading.  This item appears just as presented. NT_STATUS   The processing path for attaining a PPA data returns an NT_STATUS value.  This value basically indicates whether things were successful or not. Number Of Rows Loaded   the number of new PPA rows loaded from the UODB database. Total Number Loaded in Lifetime of Process   The total number of PPA entries read from the UODB database in the lifetime of the ASKDC process. Time of Load   Presented in milliseconds.  This is the time taken to load all new entries from the UODB. Percentage Full   The percentage full of the PPA hash table in the ASKDC. DWORD Format Logging lines associated to kerberos requests(REQ) will produce a special DWORD that indicated that status and path taken to authenticate the requestor.  This DWORD is a bit string.  The connotations of these bits are defined as follows: Position Meaning REQSTAT_AS_INVALIDSTATE   The AS request has encountered some type of general error.     REQSTAT_AS_CONNECTIONFAILURE  -- The requested failed to connect to one of the ASKdc s dependencies (XKDC front door).   REQSTAT_AS_NO_SERVICE_PRINCIPALS   service principles for the ASKdc have not yet been loaded. REQSTAT_AS_NO_KEK_LOADED   no key encryption keys have been loaded from the UODB. REQSTAT_AS_SUCCESSFUL_VALIDATION   successfully created the principle for an AS request. REQSTAT_AS_MORE_THAN_1_PRINC   signals that the request has more than 1 associated principle.  All found principles will be given for authentication.      REQSTAT_AS_PRINC_FOUND_IN_DB   The database returned data for the desired principle. REQSTAT_AS_MODIFY_GAMERTAG   The given gamertag has invalid characters which have been modified for the database lookup. REQSTAT_AS_SC_NO_PRINC_EXISTS   This request s principle was found in the secondary cache however it doesn t exist since this request is bogus. REQSTAT_AS_SC_PRINC_COPY   This request s principle was found in the secondary cache and we re going to reuse it again. REQSTAT_AS_SC_TOO_SOON   This request s principle was found in the secondary cache however it has come back to soon to be a client.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Processes TitleProcesses Michael Courage Normal Gary Thompson Microsoft Word 10.0urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags place b%MC%KDC Provider Class Overview This document contains a brief description of the classes used by the XMACS, ASKDC, and XKDC providers including the shared code in the kdchlp library. Principal Classes BasePrincipal The BasePrincipal class inherits from both the IKerbPrincipal interface and the IKDBLogonInfo interface.  Note that in this case, interface is strictly an abstract class and not an actual COM interface. IKerbPrincipal The IKerbPrincipal interface provides the methods below.  Most of these are called only by the KDC core code.  The code for all of these methods originally came from the sample provider included with the KDC core with the changes to support multiple key versions.  Also, support was removed for encryption types other than RC4-HMAC which is the only etype supported by Xbox. Decrypt If multiple key versions are present, the index of the key that successfully decrypted the data is stored in m_dwKeyIndex. Encrypt The key associated with m_dwKeyIndex is used to determine which key is used to encrypt the given data.  If only a single key version is present or if multiple key versions are present and no call to Decrypt has been made, m_dwKeyIndex will be 0 and the first key will be used for encryption. GetCipertextSize GetChecksumSize Checksum GetEtypeMatch CheckForEtype IKDBLogonInfo The IKDBLogonInfo interface exposes identity information associated with the principal that is used when building a requested PAC-COMPOUND-IDENTITY section. Even though PAC-COMPOUND-IDENTITY will only be requested for the ASKDC, the KDC core requires us to implement this interface for all principals returned to the core.  If this were not the case, the BasePrincipal class would not implement this interface. The BasePrincipal class always returns an identity of type PUID and always returns a PUID value of 0. ASPrincipal The ASPrincipal class inherits most of its behavior from BasePrincipal.  The two major additions to ASPrincipal are PUID identities and reference counting. Reference Counting To prevent denial of service attacks from users who have a valid name/key pair and can generate PPA data, a secondary cache of principals is kept by the ASKDC. If a GetPrincipal requests is made for a principal that is in the cache, it can be returned from the cache without querying UODB.  To facilitate this, the ASPrincipal class implements a reference counting mechanism by providing the methods AddRef and Release. PUID Identity Each ASPrincipal object instantiated will have an associated PUID.  This PUID is returned from UODB and is kept in the m_ulPuid member.  The m_pIdInfo member is used to build an IDENTITY struct that the KDC core uses to construct the PAC-COMPOUND-IDENTITY section of the PAC. ASKrbTgtPrincipal The ASKrbTgtPrincipal class was a late addition to the ASKDC.  It is only instantiated for the principals  krbtgt/PASSPORT.NET  and  krbtgt/XBOX.COM In order to rev the key version for krbtgt/PASSPORT.NET which is used to encrypt the intermediate TGTs returned to the client, we need to be able to force the ASKDC to encrypt tickets with key version N+1 even when presented with a ticket encrypted with key version N. Because the BasePrincipal class always encrypts with the same key that decrypted, the ASKrbTgtPrincipal class needs to override this behavior.  It adds the member variables, m_dwPassportKeyVersion and m_dwEncryptionKeyIndex as well as overriding the Encrypt method. The m_dwEncryptionKeyIndex member contains the index of the key whose version is m_dwPassportKeyVersion.  The Encrypt method always encrypts using m_dwEncryptionKeyIndex regardless of what key may have previously been used to decrypt data. ASKrbTgtPrincipal is derived from ASPrincipal and makes use of ASPrincipal s reference counting.  Because the krbtgt principals are internal only, they have no PUIDs and their PUID identity is always 0 since it will never be used. XkdcPrincipal The XkdcPrincipal class encapsulates the information needed for the Xbox client code to access a particular service.  For every instance of an Xbox Live service, there will be an instance of XkdcPrincipal instantiated and cached by the XKDC. Like the ASPrincipal, the XkdcPrincipal class implements reference counting so that the cache of principals can be reloaded while the service is running while request threads still have a reference to previous objects. The member data associated with the XkdcPrincipal includes: The service ID The IP address of the SG that fronts the service The preshared key between the XKDC and the SG for the service The specific title ID, if any, the service is restricted to The specific title version, if any, the service is restricted to The specific title region, if any, the service is restricted to (note that version 1 does not allow restrictions based on title region) The port to use when communicating with the SG Is a valid user account required to use the service? Is the service currently available?  This would be used if a third-party needed to take a game server offline for maintenance and wanted to prevent new tickets being issued for that service. XkdcServicePrincipal The XkdcServicePrincipal class encapsulates the XkdcPrincipal class and adds logic to perform required policy checks alter the behavior of Encrypt, Decrypt, etc. depending on the result of the policy checks. Error information regarding users and services is returned to the Xbox client as an encrypted preauth data structure.  Because the KDC core only returns preauth data for successful requests, a request which completely fails policy checks (no valid machine or user accounts; no valid services, etc.) still needs to result in a returned ticket so the preauth data can be returned. To accomplish this, the notion of an invalid ticket was introduced.  When a request which completely fails policy checks occurs, a ticket is generated for the non-existent SG site0 at IP address 0.0.0.0 and a random key is generated to encrypt the ticket.  This invalid ticket cannot be used anywhere but by returning it, the encrypted preauth data containing detailed error information is also returned to the client, indicating that the request failed and why. When the KDC Core invokes the XKDC s GetPrincipal method, a new instance of XkdcServicePrincipal is created which encapsulates the cached XkdcPrincipal object for the first valid service. As part of the XkdcServicePrincipal s Initialize method, all of the policy checks are performed and the detailed results of these policy checks are recorded. The Encrypt method, which will be called when the KDC core builds the ticket, examines the result of the policy checks.  If they completely failed, the bogus, random key is used.  Otherwise, the encapsulated XkdcPrincipal object s key is used. Provider Classes BaseProvider The BaseProvider class was intended to encapsulate functionality that is common to all of the provider classes   ASKDC, XKDC, and XMACS.  As of now, that includes making HTTP requests to the front doors, xmgmt commands, and handling KDC core audit events and performance counters. HttpGetBlob This method represents the largest amount of shared code across all the providers.  It handles all of the WinHttp calls to send requests and receive response data as well as all of the code to do round-robin scheduling of HTTP requests across two or more WinHttp connections. MgmtCmd methods Currently, all of the xmgmt commands available for the ASKDC, XKDC, and XMACS are implemented in the BaseProvider class as MgmtCmd methods (e.g. MgmtCmdUptime, MgmtCmdReload).  As more provider-specific methods are added, it will be worthwhile to revamp the xmgmt command handling architecture to support these more cleanly.

With so many degrees of freedom it is important to understand how they combine to create a flexible yet complicated system. Types of Gamer Pictures Large vs. Small All gamer pictures must have 2 sizes (so actually, each  gamer picture  is actually 2 distinct images).  The large size is 64x64 pixels and its PNG encoding must be less than 16k.  The small size is 32x32 pixels and its PNG encoding must be less than 4k. Pre-defined vs. Custom Pre-defined pictures are created by title developers and included in their game configuration or content download project created in XLAST.  The PNG files for the pictures are submitted to the Live service and (for game configuration projects) compiled into the SPA file for inclusion in the title s XEX file. When a title is propped to Live the pictures are copied into the storage service at this path: //global/t:titleid/tile/0/imageid where: titleid is the hex value of the titleid of the submitting title (ug, sounds like a lawyer wrote that) and imageid is a unique id assigned to the image by XLAST.  All images, including large and small versions of the same gamer picture must have unique ids. Custom pictures are raw bytes written to a profile, either the online profile via xbox.com or the local profile via a private SPI, XamWriteGamerTileEx.  Both large and small images must be submitted.  Each image must be PNG and each must meet the large and small size limits. A profile can have 1 custom gamer picture at any given time.  This means 2 custom images may be written to the storage service if the profile has a custom picture.  The storage path is: //pics/u:xuid/FFFE0700/gamerpic.type where: xuid is the online xuid, in hex, of the profile that the picture belongs to and type is:  for the large custom personal gamer picture  for the small custom personal gamer picture  for the large zune tile  for the small zune tile Example: //pics/u:9000ACB28483E/FFFE0700/gamerpic.a Public vs. Personal Each profile has up to 2 gamer pictures: a public picture and a personal picture. Public Pictures are visible to everyone, regardless of privacy settings, friend status, parental controls, etc.  They can be any pre-defined picture but cannot be custom. Issue: Public pictures cannot be custom for implementation reasons, not just policy.  The code could be updated to allow custom public pictures but that requires a flash change.  I note it here because it s a big missing piece and not something scheduled to be done for Spring 2006 s release. Personal pictures are visible only to friends, only if the owing profile is sharing settings with the viewer and only if the viewer is allowed to see user-created-content.  They can be either a pre-defined picture or a custom picture  Zune Tiles and Backgrounds Zune users have a single picture on their Zune card.  It can be a stock tile or a custom, uploaded image.  The tile can be viewed by anyone.  It is stored in the same domain as Xbox personal pictures: pics. The profile setting XPROFILE_CRUX_MEDIA_PICTURE points to the Zune tile.  This setting follows the same conventions as the personal picture tile described above (that is, it can point to a stock tile or a custom tile and when it s custom the image is stored in the pics domain). The Zune card also has a customizable background image.  The profile settings XPROFILE_CRUX_BG_LARGE_PUBLIC and XPROFILE_CRUX_BG_SMALL_PUBLIC point to the Zune background images.  The pics domain stores the custom backgrounds of Zune cards at: //pics/u:xuid/FFFE0700/usercardbackground.a Question: There are 2 images, but only 1 path listed here.  What are the 2 paths? Awarding, Setting and Retrieving Gamer Pictures Gamer pictures are referenced by key.  There are actually 2 profile settings, each of which stores part of the key.  The public part is stored in XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY and the private part is stored in XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PERSONAL_PICTURE. Each key consists of 24 Unicode characters of the form: TTTTTTTTBBBBBBBBSSSSSSSS for pre-defined pictures or TTTTTTTT0000NNNN0000NNNN for custom pictures (when stored in the profile setting) or 0000NNNNXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for custom pictures (when returned from the server) where TTTTTTTT is the titleid of the defining title, BBBBBBBB is the imageid of the big image, SSSSSSSS is the imageid of the small image, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is the xuid of the image owner and NNNN is a random number generated at the time the picture is set. All of these numbers are in hex and contain as many characters as written above (e.g.  0002004A ).  That is, there may be left padding of 0 s if the number is small. Custom pictures have TTTTTTTT equal to  FFFE0700  (defined as X_CUSTOM_PICTURE_TITLEID on both the client and on the server).  When written to the profile the titleid is always X_CUSTOM_PICTURE_TITLEID and a random number is generated and put in the key in the NNNN slots.  The xuid cannot be written because the profile may be offline in which case no online xuid is available.  The random number is used by readers to determine if the key has changed so that a cached picture can be updated. When a picture key containing a custom picture (TTTTTTTT equal to X_CUSTOM_PICTURE_TITLEID) is read from the server the key is fixed up to contain the random number and the xuid of the readee.  The client examines the key and if an online xuid is present it knows that there is a custom picture for this user. If the public key is missing a pre-defined tile in the flash is used.  If the personal key is missing or all 0 s no personal picture is assigned and the public picture will be used. These settings are never written to directly, only XGI, xbox.com and Live tools are allowed to touch them.  When read only XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY is requested and the client or server (depending on if the profile being read is local or remote) combines the two profile settings and returns the result as the data of the requested setting. The logic controlling whether or not a personal picture may be read is applied on the Live servers only.  Local profile reads always return the requested picture type, regardless of friend status, sharing or UCC.  The thinking here is that two signed in profiles on the same console do not honor sharing restrictions.  They don t for profile settings and they don t for gamer pictures, either. Since the servers always apply all the personal picture logic most callers can simply retrieve XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY and pass it to XamReadTileEx.  No worries about getting the logic right and no loopholes for accidentally displaying an inappropriate picture. There are several reasons 2 profile settings are used instead of just one: s easier to update the public or personal picture key without requiring a read of the existing key first. s easy for the server to apply different permissions to a separate setting. Backward compatibility with existing flashes is maintained. Assigning Gamer Pictures Locally The most common case of assigning gamer pictures is when a user enumerates the awarded and downloaded pictures on the console and picks one.  On doing so XamWriteGamerTileEx is called with the title and image ids of the selected picture.  Those ids are encoded in the picture s file name.  These ids are formatted and written to the profile s XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY setting and the actual bytes of the images are read locally and copied to the profile.  On sync only the key stored in the setting is sent to the server, since the server already has all pre-defined image bytes.  Only pre-defined pictures can be assigned this way. Personal pictures can be assigned in the same way, but can also be customized to be any picture (as long as the size requirements are met).  Again XamWriteGamerTileEx is used but this time ids are not passed, PNG bytes are.  The personal picture titleid is used to format a key that is written to XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PERSONAL_PICTURE and the PNG bytes are written to the local profile.  On sync the key stored in the setting and the image bytes are sent to the server. Remotely Both public and personal gamer pictures can be assigned to a profile locally or on the Live service.  No matter where the setting is changed the next time the profile syncs the setting and data (if necessary) will be synced along with everything else.  This means that a custom personal picture could be assigned to a profile on xbox.com and then the profile syncs it would receive the new setting and images.  Personal pictures can also be deleted on the server side, which is handy for replacement of inappropriate images. To assign a public or personal picture the setting value must be constructed as described above and the profile s XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY or XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PERSONAL_PICTURE setting record must be updated in t_user_settings.  The change time of the record must also be updated so that the setting will sync on the next attempt.  If the picture is custom the PNG files must also be written to storage in the path described above. To delete a personal picture the XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PERSONAL_PICTURE setting must be set to  000000000000000000000000  (converted to Unicode bytes, including the null-terminator).  The PNG files must be removed from storage. Tile Types The way the system knows what tile type to read or write is by looking at the eTileType parameter to the read/write functions.  This parameter is one of the XTILETYPE_* defines.  Those defines are described below. XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE_SMALL If qwImageId is an online xuid then that xuid's picture key will be downloaded from Live and the request will then behave the same as XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE_BY_KEY.  Friends and private checks will be performed on the server, but UCC checks are the responsibility of the caller.  This should, therefore, only be used by system apps, never public APIs. If qwImageId is not an online xuid then the request behaves the same as XTILETYPE_PERSONAL_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL]. Returns personal picture if available, else returns public picture. XTILETYPE_LOCAL_GAMER_TILE XTILETYPE_LOCAL_GAMER_TILE_SMALL These are used only for local gamer picture reads and never go to the server.  The profile to search is specified either by: 1. dwUserIndex or 2. qwImageId is an offline xuid of any local profile (the user does not need to be logged in) The public API XUserReadGamerPicture uses this type, specifying a user index.  This cannot change because legacy XTL libraries already pass this type. The user's public picture is always returned.  This is required for legacy titles and it gives a way to force the read of a public picture (like for the picture chooser screen). XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE_BY_IMAGE_ID Read locally or remotely by picture id (dwTitleId, qwImageId tuple). The public API XUserReadGamerPictureByKey uses this type, specifying a user index.  This cannot change because legacy XTL libraries already pass this type.  Newer XTL libraries pass the full key to the system which allows the system to decide which image to actually return. LiveCommon also uses this type, but only to read flash tiles in account creation. New code should avoid this type since the other types give more control and pass more information which can be used to determine the true image to return.  Prefer XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE_BY_KEY. XTILETYPE_PERSONAL_GAMER_TILE XTILETYPE_PERSONAL_GAMER_TILE_SMALL dwUserIndex specifies the profile to read if a key is not given. qwImageId must be a xuid (online or offline) this is unique to the console.  The xuid used by the in-memory and disk caches. image key is full key returned from XUserReadProfileSettings, if this is a remote read.  This parameter is optional and if not specified dwUserIndex will be used to identify the profile to read. Returns personal picture if available, else returns public picture. The public API XUserReadGamerPictureByKey uses this type.  Both the client and the server apply friends and privacy checks to combine several profile settings into this key such that the caller can simply pass it in to XUserReadGamerPictureByKey and get the right picture. XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE_BY_KEY Returns whichever picture is encoded in the key. First the key is checked for a personal picture. If one is not encoded or that picture cannot be read for some reason then the public picture is used. XTILETYPE_AWARDED_GAMER_TILE XTILETYPE_AWARDED_GAMER_TILE_SMALL Read from or write to the local set of available tiles.  Stored in profile but only locally. (dwTitleId, qwImageId) uniquely identifies a tile.  All tiles that are or can be awarded are associated with their awarding title, never standalone or dropped in the profile manually.  This is because the file name encodes the public picture key that will be set when this tile is choosen.  qwImageId encodes the small and large tile ids. Users of Gamer Pictures The various readers of gamer pictures and how they use the provided SPIs to get their job done. Sign-in Sign-in must read the large gamer picture of local profiles that are not yet signed in.  The picture is read from the profile content package header using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_LOCAL_GAMER_TILE, ...).  Only the public picture is read. Friends List The friends list and recent players scene use XamPrepareGamerTiles() to have XGI download the picture keys for the given xuids.  Then XamReadImage(XTILETYPE_GAMER_PICTURE_SMALL, ...) is called to retrieve the gamer picture.  The Live servers apply friends, shareing and UCC permissions to the keys so no additional checks are needed on the client. Common Gamercards The shared gamercard code wants the personal picture if available and the public picture if not.  There is no need to force the reading of one or the other.  Reads are done for local or remote profiles.  The logic restricting personal picture viewing must be applied because these gamercards can be used against a variety of profiles (friends, sharing, etc.). Pictures for local profiles are read using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL], ...).  See the notes above about permissions and local profiles. Pictures for remote profiles are read using XamReadTileEx(XTILETYPE_GAMER_PICTURE_BY_KEY), passing the key that was returned from XamUserReadProfileSettings(XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY, ...). Message List The initial message list doesn t show gamer pictures, but when a message is opened the sender s gamercard is displayed.  This falls into the Common Gamercard scenario. Dashboard Gamercards Sashboard gamercards use LiveCommon. I think the following is wrong.  The dash tile cache may be for other tiles types like achievements and games. The dashboard gamercards use a dashboard-specific cache of gamer pictures.  Only local profiles of signed in users are read, therefore the picture is requested by user index.  The dashboard wants a personal picture if available and the public picture if not.  This is accomplished using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL], ...) passing the user index. Gamer Picture Selection Gamer picture selection on the client always reads locally awarded and downloaded pictures.  The scene must be able to force the read of a public picture so that the user can change it even if they already have a personal picture. The public picture can be read using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_LOCAL_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL], ...).  The personal picture can be read using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL], ...).  Note that if the profile does not have a personal picture this will still return the public picture.  There is no way to retrieve just the personal picture without having XamReadTile fall back to the public picture. Public API (Titles) The public APIs don t have a choice as to which picture type to read.  If a personal picture is available and the user is allowed to see it then it is returned, else the public picture is returned.  There is no way to force one or the other. Pictures for local profiles are read using XamReadTile(XTILETYPE_GAMER_TILE[_SMALL], ...). Pictures for remote profiles are read using XamReadTileEx(XTILETYPE_GAMER_PICTURE_BY_KEY), passing the key that was returned from XUserReadProfileSettings(XPROFILE_GAMERCARD_PICTURE_KEY, ...). The XTL code that is included in XDKs before April 2006 s cannot read personal pictures.  Titles that link with libraries from the March 2006 XDK or before will only ever read public pictures for remote profiles. Other Notes Account recovery handles both public and personal pictures using the sync code.  When the picture settings come down the appropriate images are read and applied to the profile. Syncing Delay Profile settings (like the gamer picture keys and images) aren't synced immediately upon changing.  The system batches up the changes and sync the settings 1 minute after they're changed.  This could be confusing for something like motto or picture if you tell your fiend to check it out immediately.  Or if you change a setting and immediately log off. If this is causing pain I could look at performing a sync when the system UI goes away (or ~5 seconds after it goes away, actually). Caching The friends list caches a gamer s picture key until the friends apps is reloaded.  So a tile will not be loaded dynamically if a friend is sitting in the friends app.  Close and reopen and the key will be reread and the update tile will appear. Microsoft Confidential.

The tickets are encrypted and grant access to a particular Xbox Live service.   A ticket is needed to talk to a service through the Security Gateway (SG). M1 Milestone The XMAC and XKDC services are being combined into one server cluster.  There will be minimal changes to the service code itself but there will be big changes in the way configuration is being loaded.  With the addition of the configuration database, the XKDC service will load its configuration information from a configuration database instead of a local initialization file.  The XMACS and XKDC components will also now rely on the XMOSS server to load its encrypted service keys.  With out this XMOSS service, the XKDC and XMACS will fail to initialize properly.  This test plan will document my approach to make sure these changes will be well tested for eventual production deployment. M2 Milestone Update to M1: MOSS was not implemented and is currently scheduled for M3.  Service key decryption remains the same. For M2, the KDC is being modified to support finer-grained authorization to better support parental controls and new features.  The KDC will support the notion of privileges, which can represent a subset of collection of services.  For instance, XE_PRIVILEGE_ONLINE_GAMEPLAY represents all basic services needed for online multiplayer gameplay.  To support these changes, several new database tables are being introduced. The KDC will allow implicit services to be granted to a user; that is, all services that a user has permission to can be granted in a ticket, as compared to the Xbox1 method of having the client explicitly request each service. The KDC will also support additional services, in addition to the privileges, in each ticket.   All of these changes are for Xenon only; the KDC will retain 100% backwards compatibility with Xbox1 clients and LSP services behind existing SGs.  M3 Milestone The Xenon XKDC now distinguishes between Xbox clients, Xenon clients, and Xenon clients running in back-compat mode.  It notes this distinction in a flag in the authdata ticket, which the SG will consume.  There is also UODB work being done to add a bronze tier to the system with dummy values, and some lingering M2 work items are being completed, such as per-offer and per-title privilege grants.  LiveTitleIds and AlternateServiceTitleIds have been completed.  The Xenon TGS request implemented in M2 has been duplicated into a second versin, which has a smaller Service Result to allow it to pass through all routers.  The M2 version will be slowly phased out and replaced entirely with the M3 version. Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases.  There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone 95% positive cases passing and 95% negative cases passing.  There is no required stress testing. M3 Milestone 95%+ positive cases passing and 95%+ negative cases passing.  A baseline stress TPS measurement will be performed.  Target TPS numbers have not been defined for this milestone. Goals This section lists what will be covered for each milestone. M1 Milestone New test cases to validate the new configuration settings being pulled from the configuration database vs. the previous local initialization file method. Test use of XMOSS server for encrypted key retrieval. Simultaneous execution of XMAC and XKDC tests to validate server consolidation. Run old functional and stress tests to verify that there have been no behavior changes in server since the previous release. M2 Milestone Run old functional and stress tests to verify that there have been no behavior changes in server since the previous release.  This is particularly important since there are significant Xenon changes but Xbox1 should still work. Tests covering new features added in M2. Test support for authdata2 and authdata3.  The KDC will return authdata3 except for clients that request services behind old SG sites (EA, LSP), in which case it has to support authdata2 still. M3 Milestone New test for the Xenon client in back-compat mode flag.  Tests for per-offer and per-title privilege grants. Tests for distinction between bronze and silver tiers to make sure the KDC grants the proper services and privileges for a user in each tier.   Non-Goals This section lists what will not be covered for each milestone. M1 Milestone M2 Milestone Work for per-offer and per-title privilege grants was not completed.  Only the silver tier has been added, so it is impossible to test the proper behavior of tiers.

HYPERLINK "http://sts/Xbox_Online/Test/XKDC Server Test Plan.doc"  http://sts/Xbox_Online/Test/XKDC Server Test Plan.doc  -- The earlier version of the XKDC test plan. Overview What a KDC does As part of the Kerberos protocol, a KDC is responsible for generating and issuing security tickets upon request from a client.  The tickets are encrypted with the requester s key and are thus only available to it.  There are two main types of tickets that can be issued: Ticket-Granting Tickets and Service Tickets. Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT) A TGT is a ticket that authenticates a client and grants access to get security tickets (ST).  A client requests a TGT from a TGT-provider KDC (AS-REQ).  The TGT is returned (AS-REP), encrypted with the key of the KDC that the TGT is intended for and encrypted on top of that with the key of the client, along with a session key.  The session key is also stored inside the TGT.  The client can not decrypt the TGT because it does not know the target KDC s key.  The TGT can be presented to the targeted KDC as part of a request to get STs that the client is authorized for. Service Tickets (ST) A ST is a ticket that is used to grant access to a particular service.  To get a ST for a particular service from a target KDC (TGS-REQ), the client must send the TGT encrypted with the target KDC s key along with a timestamp encrypted with the session key to the KDC.  The KDC will decrypt the TGT to get the session key, use that to decrypt the timestamp, and check that to see if it is within a range of the current time.  The KDC then knows whether the TGT is legit and, using the information in the TGT, checks to see if it should grant the user access to the requested services.  For each authorized service the KDC sends the client a ST along with a timestamp, encrypted with the session key (TGS-REP).  The ST can then be presented in a similar way to the TGT to a service to authenticate against that service. Kerberos relies on the fact that all of the servers and clients have loosely synchronized clocks.  This is to prevent replay attacks and to enforce ticket expirations to work correctly.  Although the servers  clocks need to always match, the client can always get the correct time from a server and use that time for further communication with that server. Xbox KDC specifics The ASKDC handles the AS (REQ/REP) cycle and grants the authenticated user a cross-realm (xbox.com) TGT.  The XKDC handles the TGS (REQ/REP) cycle of Kerberos authentication.  There are three types of TGTs that the ASKDC can grant for use on the XKDC: Machine TGTs, User TGTs and Combined-TGTs. User and Machine TGTs When an Xbox wants to authenticate a user or itself, it sends an AS-REQ to the ASKDC and receives a TGT which can be used to validate that user or machine and receive a Combined-TGT.  These TGTs expire after one week and are cached on the Xbox until they expire or the XKDC informs the Xbox that the cached tickets are no longer good. Combined-TGTs One machine TGT and between zero and four user TGTs can be sent to a Passport TGS to be combined into an Combined-TGT.  This TGT contains the PUIDs of the machine and users  Passport accounts, encrypted with the XKDC key.  A new Combined-TGT is necessary any time the users in a game change but several different Combined-TGTs may be cached on a Xbox to reduce server load and improve client performance.  These Combined-TGTs expire after one week and are cached on the Xbox until they expire or the XKDC informs the Xbox that the cached tickets are no longer good. Xbox STs The Combined-TGT is sent to the XKDC in a service request (SR).  The request contains a list of which services the game desires.  The XKDC validates the ticket and validates the machine s and users  rights to those services by checking with the Users and Offerings Database (UODB).  The XKDC sends the machine account, list of user accounts, and the list of services being requested to the UODB and the UODB returns back the list of services that the users have access to.  Users will be authorized to a particular service if any valid, unblocked user has access to that service.  The one exception is the UACS.  If the machine account is valid then permission to use the UACS is always granted when requested.  A security ticket (ST) is needed to talk through a Security Gateway (SG) to a service and multiple services may lie behind a particular SG.  One ST is returned to the Xbox for each SG. Functional Testing Summary As we move into Xenon, it is important the KDC maintains 100% backward compatibility with Xbox 1 clients.  This means new tests should be created where necessary and old tests left alone. For milestone M1, we have the additional goals of testing: Integrity of XMACS/XKDC server consolidation.  The components remain separate but will run on the same server.  We will test that the XKDC does not respond to XMACS requests.  Use of XMOSS for master key retrieval. [not done for M1] Use of Configuration Database for all settings. For milestone M2: New Xenon service request for Tgs request to XKDC.  This is in addition to the old Xbox service request format, which will still be supported. Additional services supported, up to 32 now. Privileges and services with implicit granting based on a user s tier. New authdata v3 in encrypted ticket returned to client. Backwards support for old authdata (2), needed for legacy LSP sites.  Only returned to clients who request a service behind an older SG site.  Alternate TitleIDs Parental controls For milestone M3: Xenon client in back-compat mode flag in authdata ticket.  Detected by comparing machine PUID (to identify Xenon client) and type of TGS request (whether Xenon TGS or Xbox TGS request).   New authorization steps exposed by per-offer and per-title privilege grants.   Parentally controlled users. Bronze tier privileges. Auto-discovery of LSP titles. LiveTitleId and LiveServiceTitleId additions, to allow for alternate LiveTitleIds and alternate LiveServiceTitleIds, which are only used for the given service. New Test Cases for M1 Milestone Configuration Database Each individual setting will be tested as well as global behavior. CONFIGDB_SETTINGS: For each setting in the configuration database, the following three tests will be performed: Initialize   Using the management commands, verify that the setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized.   Reconfigure   Using the management commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take effect (only applies to settings requiring a restart). Undo   Using the management commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take affect.  Now change the setting back to the original value and using the management commands, verify that it is set back to the original value and does not require a restart of the service. Implementation note: Reconfigure and Undo can be consolidated into one test. The settings have been moved to Appendix   REF _Ref87931284 \r \h   \* MERGEFORMAT  CONFIGDB_NO_CONNECTION: No connection available to configuration server.  KDC should raise an error and entering a polling loop, waiting for a response. Server Consolidation Send packets that would normally go to the XMACS to the XKDC address (ip and port).  These should all be dropped by the XKDC. New Test Cases for M2 Milestone After signing in users and the machine, the client sends a SERVICE_REQUEST packet (KRB_TGS_REQ) to the KDC to request services.  We now have an Xbox version and a Xenon version of this packet and its reply.  Red lines indicate new items in the struct.

The authdata is returned to the client by the KDC in an encrypted ticket.  The client cannot decrypt this information.  It sends the ticket to the SG, which can decrypt it, and uses it, for instance, to reply to SpiInfo requests from the servers.  In the test version of our kerbclient.dll, the decryption keys have been hardcoded, so our tests can decrypt this authdata structure.   typedef struct _XKERB_AD_XENON     #define XONLINE_XENON_AUTHDATA_VERSION 3     WORD                     wAuthDataVersion;     WORD                     wAuthDataSize;     XBOX_LIBRARY_VERSION     clientVersion;     DWORD                    dwTitleID;     DWORD                    dwTitleVersion;     DWORD                    dwTitleRegion;     DWORD                    dwConsoleRegion;     DWORD                    dwMediaID;     WORD                     wLanguageID;     DWORD                    dwAuthDataFlags;     WORD                     wNumPrivileges;     DWORD                    dwPrivileges[XONLINE_NUM_PRIVILEGE_DWORDS];     ULONGLONG                qwXboxID;     // The high 16 bits of dwUserFlags should come from the UODB User Table.

All existing KDC tests should pass.  These are detailed in the Existing Reusable Test Cases section below. ALL TESTS: Xenon Service Request The existing set of KDC service request tests, as enumerated in the Existing Reusable Test Cases section below, should be modified to include sending a XKERB_PA_XENON_SERVICE_REQUEST as well.   Issues: There exists a test that requests 17 services.  For the Xbox story, this will fail, which is what the test expects to happen.  For Xenon, however, this will succeed, as we now support up to 32 services.   I suspect there will be other cases that succeed for an Xbox client and fail for Xenon.  This will probably be for the negative cases, where we expect failure for Xbox, but it will end up succeeding for Xenon.  I will either special-case these tests in the dynamic Xenon test case generation code or move them into an Xbox-specific group that can be special-cased out.  Additional services without auto-discovery Our previous limit was 16 services.  This has been expanded to 31 services.  Service ID 0 is considered invalid, which is why we re limited to 31 and not 32.  The TGS request actually supports 32 single byte services plus 4 dword services, but the SG does not support this many.   All test cases in this section will include a mix of: All valid services Some valid, some invalid services All valid with duplicates 1SubscribedService Request a single service that the user is subscribed to 1NonSubscribedService Request a single service that the user is not subscribed to 1Sub1NonSub Request 1 service a user is subscribed to and 1 service the user is not subscribed to 2Sub_DiffSites Request 2 services, user is subscribed to both, but they are on different sites 2Sub1NonSub_DiffSites Request 2 services user is subscribed to, 1 service user is not subscribed to on a different site 0Services0Dwords  Request 0 services and 0 dword services.  Invalid. 0Services4Dwords Request 0 services and 4 dword services. 1Services0Dwords Request 1 services and 0 dword services. 1Services4Dwords Request 1 services and 4 dword services. 17Services0Dwords Request 17 services and 0 dword services. 17Services4Dwords Request 17 services and 4 dword services. MaxServices Request as many services as we can. Currently only 17 base services are defined and valid, plus we can only request 4 additional dword services, so our request is for 21 services total. AutoPlus1Extended Use auto-discovery, but also explicitly request 1 additional extended service. Privileges and auto-discovery Privileges are automatically granted to a user based on which tier a user is in.  Privileges are related to tiers based on regions (see table t_tier_region_privileges).  Privileges can also be granted and restricted individually, for instance by parental controls or customer service (see tables t_user_privilege_restrictions and t_user_privilege_grants). In the TGS Request packet, a client can specify that it wants to auto-discover all services and privileges that it has permission to access.  These tests will all use auto-discovery to verify the correct set of services and privileges are returned.  These tests will require the creation of the following users.  Gamertag Restrictions Grants xktusert1a xktusert1b 254,255 xktusert1c 251,253 xktusert1d 254,255 251,253 xktusert2a xktusert2b 254,255 xktusert2c 251,253 xktusert2d 254,255 251,253 The restricted privileges are 255 and 254.  The granted privileges are 251 and 253.  In addition, a user has been created who has every privilege restricted. Note: for M2, tiers are not usable.  We only have 1 base offer defined, which is tied to tier 2.  Thus, we can only assign users to tier 2 until we get more base offers tied to tiers.  SingleUserLogon_AllCombos The test will log in with each user (3 tiers, 4 variations in each tier, for a total of 12 logins) and verify the list of services and privileges is correct for the user as returned in the Service Address struct.   Multi2Logon_1 Log in user 2a and user 2b, set of services and privileges should equal user 2b. Multi2Logon_2 Log in user 2b and user 2c, set of services and privileges should equal user 2b. Multi2Logon_3 Log in user 2c and user 2d, set of services and privileges should equal user 2d. Multi3Logon_1 Log in user 2a and user 2b and user 2d, set of services and privileges should equal user 2b. Multi4Logon_1 Log in user 2a and user 2b and user 2c and user 2d, set of services and privileges should equal user 2b. UserWithOfferGrant Log in user with a subscription to an offer that grants a privilege not in t_tier_region_privileges.  User should get this privilege. Not implemented for M2 UserRestrictedWithOfferGrant Log in user with a subscription to an offer that grants a privilege not in t_tier_region_privileges and that the user is explicitly restricted from..  User should not get this privilege. Not implemented for M2 UserGrantedWithOfferGrant Log in user with a subscription to an offer that grants a privilege not in t_tier_region_privileges and that the user is explicitly granted access to.  User should get this privilege. Not implemented for M2 TitleGrant Log in various users with a title that grants access to a privilege not in t_tier_region_privileges.  Log in with user who is restricted from this privilege, with one who has a grant to a different service, with one who has no grants or restrictions. Not implemented for M2 New Authdata version 3 in ticket The KDC includes the authdata in an encrypted ticket sent to the client after the TGS request.  This ticket is sent along to the SG.  Using the KerbClient.dll, we can crack this ticket and examine the contents.  For M2, the KDC now sends authddata version 3 for both Xbox and Xenon clients.   Note: tests in other sections will also verify the authdata, such as the title id returned, the services specified in the bit array, the privileges in the bit array, the intersection of privileges across all users, etc.  This check is extensive.  This section specifically covers authdata-related test cases. AuthdataVersion3AsXenon Send a Xenon TGS request using autodiscovery.  Should get an authdata3 structure returned. AuthdataVersion3AsXbox Send a Xbox TGS request using a few basic services.  Should get an authdata3 structure returned. AuthdataVersion2AsXenon Send a Xenon TGS request requesting a service behind a legacy site.  Do not use auto discovery.  Should get an authdata2 structure returned. AuthdataVersion2AsXbox Send a Xbox TGS request requesting a service behind a legacy site.  Should get an authdata2 structure returned. AuthdataVersionMixedAsXenon Send a Xenon TGS request for 2 services, with 1 service behind a legacy site and 1 regular service.  Try different ordering of these 2 services, including a services above and below the legacy one.  It is expected that ordering in the request does not matter, but that the lowest service requested will be the   one.  Thus if the lowest numbered service is a regular one, we ll get authdata version 3, but if the lowest numbered service is behind a legacy site, we ll get authdata version 2. AuthdataXenonFields Send request as Xenon.  Expect to get authdata3 structure.  In the request, set the new fields: dwConsoleRegion dwMediaID wLanguageID These fields should simply be passed into the authdata that the KDC returns to the client.  Verify this is so. Alternate title IDs No work here for M2. Parental controls No work here for M2.

The byteServiceResult and dwordServiceResult structures were reduced, and the alternate title ids were cleaned up. Back-compat issues This adds a new flag to the dwAuthdataFlags field in the XKERB_AD_XENON structure, which is returned by the XKDC in an encrypted ticket.  The SG will use this flag to selectively issue challenges (i.e., a Xenon console running in back-compat mode is not challenged).  By cracking this ticket, the KDC tests can verify the values. All existing tests that verify values within the authdata structure will be modified to check for the non-existence of the new back-compat flag.  The tests below will explicitly check for the flag. Users are along the left side.  Machine/title combinations are across the top.   An Xbox-only user has an entry in t_user_keys but not t_xenon_user_keys.   A Xenon-only user has an entry in t_xenon_user_keys but not t_user_keys.   A dual user has both keys along with the XenonFlag set in t_users.   A user is restricted from signing into Xbox Live (from Xbox title) by the column in t_users called f_allow_xbox1_logon. A machine is distinguished by its PUID.  Xenon machines have a different PUID range. A title is distinguished by the type of TGS request it makes (Xbox or Xenon TGS).

A bit was added to the UserFlags field to indicate if a user is parentally controlled or not.  This is determined by looking at the fields bi_user_passport_puid and bi_owner_passport_puid in t_users.  If the fields are different, then this bit will be set. ParentalControls_DiffOwnerPuid_UserFlagsSet Sign in with user  xktduchilt2a , which is a dual Xenon/Xbox user in the silver 2 with no grants or restrictions AND has a different owner puid than user puid, hence the   (child) part in the middle of the name.

FlashVersion_Update t_title_versions for flash id 0xFFFFFFFF: Base_version Update_version For each item, sign in both machine-only and with users.  Sign in with: FlashVersion 0.  Expect success. FlashVersion 1.  Expect auto-update required error and only get service id 3 (auto-update).  FlashVersion 2.  Expect error (? or does this depend on allowUnknownVersions?).   FlashVersion 3.  Expect auto-update required error and only get service id 3 (auto-update).  Auto-discovery of services for LSP titles Note: this is the work item added post-TCC. Auto-discovery returns services in t_tier_region_services, based on a user s tier and region.  The table t_title_services was added to allow specific services to be granted on a per-title basis, much like privileges can be granted by a title with the user of t_title_privileges.   User is  xktdulsput2a  - dual Xenon/Xbox user, lsp user "lspu", tier 2, no grants or restrictions "a" This user's subscription #2 gets services 8002, 8012, 8013. Other one, the main one, gets 8005. Title 0xFFBEEF40 grants services 8012, 8013 Title 0xFFBEEF41 grants service 8002 Service 8002 is open to all titles Service 8012 is restricted to title 0xFFBEEF40  version 0 Service 8013 is restricted to title 0xFFBEEF40  version 1 All tests will use Xenon requests with auto-discovery.  For single-user cases, use  xktdulsput2a  will be used. Auto_TitleServices_Simple Login with title 0xFFBEEF41, version 0, expect additional service 8002 with hr=1.

XKDC server down -- Requests should not go to this server XKDC network loss -- Requests should not go to this server Stress Testing M1 Milestone:  No stress testing will be performed for this milestone due to the functional changes being validated in this timeframe. M2 Milestone:  No stress testing required. M3 Milestone:  A baseline TPS measurement will be made, along with trial 24-hour and 72-hour runs to verify the correctness of the stress tools and make sure nothing catastrophic happened to the server in the past 3 milestones.

It will outline configuration facts about this execution, information that is displayed and the significance of this data.  The XKDC logging area follows guides set for Xbox Live servers defined in the document:  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/LogPrinciples.doc"  http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/LogPrinciples.doc Please reference this document for more details on why log data is presented in a specific format. Configuration The XKdc utilizes the Xmgmt libraries for to produce logging records.  As a result, logging details can be managed from the XMGMT interface or askdc.ini file.  The logging areas are: XkdcLog XkdcTicketLog These areas produce messages for logging purposes.  Other areas exists which provide more in-depth descriptions of errors.   Data Format The XKdc provides 5 different log line entries to express the flow of information.  These 5 areas can be identified by their prefix marker.  The information following this marker gives an indication of a successful or failed execution.  Note that 2 of these entries are designed specifically for the Ticketlog.  The 5 entries are: XkdcLog Authentication Request FORMAT:  REQ|IP Address|client version|Title Id|Title Version|Title Region|MachinePUID| User PUID player 1|User Status player 1|BillingStatus Player 1| User PUID player 2|User Status player 2|BillingStatus Player 2| User PUID player 3|User Status player 3|BillingStatus Player 3| User PUID player 4|User Status player 4|BillingStatus Player 4|Services Requested|Site Granted|Services Attained|Ticket Lifetime|DWORD Status|KerbErr|  Prefix log identifier for the authentication request.

This is the only time the Xbox talks with the XMAC server. M1 Milestone The XMAC and XKDC services are being combined into one server cluster.  There will be minimal changes to the service code itself but there will be big changes in the way configuration is being loaded.  With the addition of the configuration database, the XMAC service will load its configuration information from a configuration database instead of a local initialization file.  This test plan will document my approach to make sure these changes will be well tested for eventual production deployment. M2 Milestone No work. M3 Milestone There is now a Xenon AS request in addition to the Xbox AS request for machine account creation.  Xenon requests do not require geneology, as they use a set of private and public keys to ensure their identity.  We are still collecting geneology information which will be used as a fallback.  This is not implemented in M3. M4 Milestone Reminder: Test Xenon geneology. Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases.  There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone M3 Milestone 95%+ passing positive test cases and 95%+ passing negative test cases. Goals This section lists what will be covered for each milestone. M1 Milestone New test cases to validate the new configuration settings being pulled from the configuration database vs. the previous local initialization file method. Simultaneous execution of XMAC and XKDC tests to validate server consolidation. Run old functional and stress tests to verify that there have been no behavior changes in server since the previous release. M2 Milestone M3 Milestone New test cases for Xenon requests.  This is a brand new request type. Run existing tests to make sure nothing broke. Non-Goals This section lists what will not be covered for each milestone.

HYPERLINK "http://sts/Xbox_Online/Test/XMACS Server Test Plan.doc"  http://sts/Xbox_Online/Test/XMACS Server Test Plan.doc  -- The earlier version of the XMACS test plan. Overview The first interaction an Xbox ever has with the Xbox Online service is connecting to the Xbox Machine Account Creation Service (XMACS) and creating an account for itself.  This account must be used to authenticate with Passport before getting any further access to Xbox Online services. When a Xbox goes online for the first time, it sends authentication information to the XMACS.  This information includes the Xbox s unique serial number and some data encoded with its unique  online key , in a Kerberos AS-REQ.  The XMACS verifies this data against the Genealogy Database to validate the Xbox.  After the Machine Passport is created successfully, it is entered into the User Account Database (UODB) and the username and password are sent to the Xbox. Xenon clients will use a new protocol, which also overloads Kerberos in the same manner.  Xbox 1 used symmetric keys to authenticate the console.  Xenon will use public key cryptography and certificates to authenticate Xenon consoles.  The XMACS server will be backwards compatible. Functional Testing Summary There are two main goals of the functional test cases for the XMACS server. Verify the entire Kerberos/AS cycle works correctly from the client to and from the XMACS server. Verify creation and renewal of machine accounts. There will also be test cases to make sure that the XMACS does not respond to Kerberos/TGS or Kerberos/AP.  M1 Milestone For milestone M1, we have the additional goals of testing: Integrity of XMACS/XKDC server consolidation.  The components remain separate but will run on the same server.  We will test that the XMACS does not respond to XKDC requests. Use of Configuration Database for all settings. M2 Milestone No work. M3 Milestone Basic mainline and negative test cases for new Xenon protocol. Approximate duplication of existing Xbox XMACS tests using the Xenon request. Shallow testing of crypto system, such as using different keys, flipping bits, etc.  This will change on the client, and may require corresponding server changes, so deep testing at this point seems unwise. M4 Milestone Test Xenon geneology fallback system. New Test Cases for M1 Milestone Configuration Database Each individual setting will be tested as well as global behavior. CONFIGDB_SETTINGS: For each setting in the configuration database, the following three tests will be performed: Initialize   Using the management commands, verify that the setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized.   Reconfigure   Using the mamagement commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take effect (only applies to settings requiring a restart). Undo   Using the management commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take affect.  Now change the setting back to the original value and using the management commands, verify that it is set back to the original value and does not require a restart of the service. Implementation note: Reconfigure and Undo can be consolidated into one test. The settings have been moved to Appendix   REF _Ref87931284 \r \h  \* MERGEFORMAT  Error! Reference source not found. CONFIGDB_NO_CONNECTION: No connection available to configuration server.  XMACS should raise an error and entering a polling loop, waiting for a response. New Test Cases for M2 Milestone No work for XMACS in M2. New Test Cases for M3 Milestone Currently, our test environment uses fake keys generated by a tool dcaiafa wrote.  This includes the MasterSigningKey and MasterXMACSKey.  The Xenon client is expected to store OnlineRSAKey.Private and a certificate, encrypted with MasterSigningKey.Private, that contains the ConsoleID, a timestamp, and OnlineRSAKey.Public.   Inputs in console request to XMACS: pre-auth encrypted session key (encrypted with Xmacs key) authtime sha1(session-key) sign(authtime || sha1(session-key)) console certificate console id console part number console type manufacturing date game region console public key signature (RsaSign(MasterKey.Private, Sha1(abHash1 || abHash2))) principal name (built from console id) Keys used for encryption/decryption/signing: MasterSigningKey [global] MasterXmacsKey [global] OnlineRSAKey [per console] The actual console certificate structure looks like: struct CONSOLE_CERTIFICATE     WORD   cbCertSize;     BYTE   abConsoleId[5];                          // Uniquely ids console     BYTE   abConsolePartNumber[8];                  // Identifies mfg part number     DWORD  dwConsoleType;                           // Console is a retail or dev/test kit     UINT64 qwManufacturingDate;                     // Date of mfg for console     UINT64 qwGameRegion;                            // Game region     CONSOLE_PUBLIC_KEY ConsolePublicKey;            // Console's Public Key //    BYTE   abHash1[CONSOLE_CERTIFICATE_HASH_SIZE];          // Sha1(abConsoleId 'til ConsolePublicKey) //    BYTE   abHash2[CONSOLE_CERTIFICATE_HASH_SIZE];          // Sha1(ConsolePublicKey)     BYTE   abSignature[256];                        // RsaSign(MasterKey.Private, Sha1(abHash1 || abHash2)) struct CONSOLE_PUBLIC_KEY     BYTE abPublicExp[4];     BYTE abModulus[128]; As agreed upon by dcaiafa and vanvan, all fields will be stored little-endian except for abConsoleId, which is big-endian (due to the 4-bit checksum at the end).

All tests should fail.  All tests should result in no response from XMACS except the ones marked otherwise.  3.d and 3.e have invalid console ids (too big, too small).

Xbox Machine Account Creation Server XMACS Lawrence Ohab Outline What is XMACS? Machine Account Creation Process External Dependencies Genealogy nCipher UODB/XMACSFD Starting XMACS Advanced XMACS What is XMACS? Machine account creation server. XMACS is an AS KDC server that services AS requests. Why not use ISAPI like UACS? XMACS provides all machine account information in the AS replies PreAuth Data. What about that ticket? Genealogy Database nCipher The nCipher device in an integrated component of the XMACS server. The Xbox Online Private key is stored in a heavily encrypted file on the harddrive. For an nCipher device to be able to read this file, it must first be added to the Xbox security world.  This process requires 2 admin cards which are currently locked up. Once part of this security world, the nCipher device can read this private key file. All programs that desire the use of this device are must be authorized before given a handle for decrypting/encrypting.  The authorization comes from an operator card that must be present while the service/executable is trying to acquire a handle. XMACS passes the 128 byte data blob to the nCipher device which performs the 1024 bit private key decryption and returns a 16 byte online key. Stage 1 Complete UODB and XMACSFD The XMACS FD accepts http requests and performs queries on the UODB. The front door will only permit certain stored procs to be called. Any errors that occur during the webstore/sql transactions are logged in the XMACSFD server.  XMACS only gets a 500 http code if a problem occurs. The UODB stores all machine account in a similar style to user accounts.  Machines have entries in both t_user_names and t_user_keys.  The exception is that additional machine specific information is stored in t_machines. The UODB also stores important service keys and PUID data. Starting XMACS During startup, XMACS will attempt to talk to all dependencies for different reasons.   Some interactions during startup are critical.  Other interactions are required for creating accounts but not for startup. XMACS also requires 1 operator card to be present in the nCipher device during startup.  Events are logged to indicate when it is safe to remove this card. Advanced XMACS Around the basics of creating a machine account, XMACS uses a few more advanced tricks to ensure security and performance. These include: Key management. Pre-PreAuth data and loading Replay DoS Cache. PUID management. Key Management Pre-PreAuth Data Replay DoS cache PUID Management XMACS grabs blocks of PUIDs from the UODB.  Usually, these block are composed of 256 unique PUIDs. XMACS has a worker thread that is responsible for attaining these PUIDs from the UODB when its block has run out.

It will describe the basic functionality of XMACS and how it interacts with its dependencies.  The document describes details of XMACS Xmgmtc  interface covering what is available and how to use it.  The contents and setting for XMACS s ini file are defined.  The document also contains a section for FAQ questions.  This section contains frequently seen problems encountered when setting up XMACS.  The sections goal is to provide insight on how to handle these issues or give hint on possible similar issues. Design Purpose XMACS is the machine account creation server.  Its role is to authenticate all valid Xbox consoles and create a machine account in the UODB for that machine.   Process Description All the components described in this process are described in further detail within their respective sections.   XMACS procedure is straightforward but reliant on numerous dependencies.  The Xbox is responsible for sending a Kerberos AS request to XMACS containing the unit s serial number.  Once XMACS receives this request, it retrieves the serial number and  Pre-PreAuth (PPA) data.  Using this PPA data, XMACS will scan its  Black Box  hash table and verify that this is a real Xbox.  Once the account is verified, XMACS then lookups up this entry in its DoS cache table.  If the entry exists in the table, XMACS uses the cached information to verify the online key and return previously acquired PreAuth data.  Note that the values in this cache have a lifetime associated with them.  The configuration file settings for this are DOSStage1CacheTimeout, for machine verification, and DOSStage2CacheTimeout, for PreAuth data.  These cache values will be renewed once their lifetime has expired.  Please view section 4.1.1 for details about this setting.   If the entry is not found, XMACS will acquire a new cache node for the entry and begin the setup process.  This setup process first consists of gathering verification information.  XMACS will use the acquired serial number and query the Genealogy database for this entry.  When it has this entry XMACS will utilize the nCipher device to decrypt the data associated with this serial number.  It will then verify that the data in the database is correct.  This data is then copied into the cache and the cache node is released for viewing by other threads.  The data is then submitted to the KDC core for authentication. When the KDC core determines that this is the correct password, it will try to build the  Pre-Auth  data for this machine.  This Pre-Auth data is in fact the machine account.  The cache node is once again acquired as XMACS sends a request to the XMACSfd to determine if the UODB has already has this entry.  If the entry is found, XMACS resets the password in the UODB and returns the client its new information.  If the entry is not found, XMACS gets a PUID for this serial number and generates a new password.  It then sends requests to XMACSfd to insert this entry in to the t_user_names/t_user_keys tables and t_machines table, respectively.  Once this is done XMACS sends this data back to the requesting Xbox console. Starting XMACS XMACS is a service and should be managed from the service manager.  You can also start XMACS from the command prompt by typing: net start xmacs The start procedure causes XMACS to talk all of its dependencies.  In turn, XMACS will produce a series of event logs that will indicate whether XMACS is starting properly or not.  Should XMACS fail to initialize enough memory for its 2 hash tables or fail to talk to an nCipher device then it will fail to start.  You will see an event for the failed dependency and an event claiming an unsuccessful start to XMACS.   If XMACS fails to talk to the Genealogy database during startup, it will continue to constantly poll (on a one minute interval between retries) this database until it comes online.  XMACS will produce informational event logs for when it has begun the process of reading Genealogy data and when it successfully completes this task.  It will produce caution and error logs if something fails during this time. If XMACS fails to talk to the UODB, it will constantly poll the UODB (on a 5 second interval between retries) until it is successful.  It does this polling while it attempts to attain a new block of PUIDs.  XMACS also attains service key information (for the key encryption key) from the UODB during start up, however if this fails, it will only try again during the first request or a machine account. Reloading XMACS XMACS does have a reload feature available through the XMGMT console.  The method of executing the reload command is further described in section 6.2.  This section describes what action are carried out when performing a reload. During the reload process XMACS will perform the following functions: Reloads data variables including values for key encryption key version.  Note that XMACS does not reload config values from the file.  This feature mainly re-initializes these values.  This should be changed for future versions. Re-attains service keys from UODB. Gets a new block of PUIDs for XMACS. Wakes up the PPA loader thread to attain the newest entries in the Genealogy database. This command is thread safe and can be called while XMACS is still handling requests. DevKits DevKits are a special case for XMACS.  DevKits do not carry real genealogy information.  They do contain a standard key that is shared by all devkits.  DevKits also contain a special serial number that they present to attain an account.  It s not the serial number of the box but rather a combination of the machines MAC address and two 9 s in the ninth and tenth positions of the serial number.  Once XMACS identifies this serial number, it adds the entry to the PPA table so that and reads a special  999999999999 s entry from the genealogy database.  XMACS continues from that point to create a machine account for that DevKit. Two step are required to make XMACS accept DevKits.  First, in the xmacs.ini file, the AcceptDevKits setting should be set to 1.  Second, add the special  999999999999 s entry to the information in the Genealogy database.  There is a script file containing this information and the correct key.  Both step are necessary for XMACS to accept DevKits. Dependencies XMACS is dependent on 3 separate external resources for successful operation.  Once any one of these components fails to interact with XMACS, the service will be unable to create machine accounts.  Events are logged with descriptive messages should any problems occur. Genealogy The Genealogy database is a listing of all Xboxes and online machine information.  The database contains a listing of all part numbers and a huge table of machines.  XMACS runs the stored procedure (p_xbox_get_machineinfo) which scans the machine table for the desired entry.  In addition, the Genealogy database also stores PPA data used by XMACS.  XMACS reads these PPA values from Genealogy using the stored procedure p_xmacs_get_ppadata.  For detail on how this works please see section 3.7. nCipher Device The nCipher device is used to decrypt information stored in the Genealogy database.  When XMACS starts, it requires that nFast has been installed and the nFast service is running.  During the start up processes, XMACS also requires that the operator card is inserted within the nForce device.  This card is only required at startup and can be removed once the event (XEVENT_XMACS_NCIPHER_SUCCESSFULLY_ATTAINED_CRYPTO_KEYS) shows up in the event log.  From that point XMACS maintains a handle to the information managed by this device.  The nCipher card is not requested for an XMGMTC reload. UODB and XMACSFD The UODB is where machines account information is stored.  XMACS uses this database to determine if the machine account already exists and to create/modify the properties of that account.  The UODB is also where XMACS attains PUID blocks for account.  It stores an encrypted version of the key encryption key that is used to encrypt machine keys in the database.  Communication with the UODB is currently done through the XMACSFD.  This server simply takes ISAPI requests from XMACS and performs SQL queries through webstore on the UODB.  All errors encountered during this query are logged in the event log of the XMACSFD server.  The only thing XMACS will know is that it received a 500 http code from the server.  The XMACSFD ini file contains a list of all stored procedures this server is allowed to execute.  They are separated into 2 lists.  A read only stored procedure list and a write then read list.  These lists correspond to the type of Webstore database the command will be executed on. (FUTURE NOTE:  It is possible to pass the error message from the XMACSFD to XMACS.  For future versions of this system, we should get the XMACSFD to pass that data back with the 500 http code.  This will allow people to see and debug this problem from 1 server as opposed to 2 of them. ) Pre-PreAuth Data Pre-Pre Auth data is the XBOX Live mechanism for preventing the amount of work we do for denial of service attacks.  Without this implementation, we were forced to do a database lookup in Genealogy for every entry that is presented to XMACS, with the exception of reply packets that are contained by the DoS Cache described in section 3.9.  PPA data is generated from machine information.  The 2 important keys here are the serial number and the online key on the Xbox. PPA Data Format Whenever a new principal entry is added to the system, the following fields are computed:  PPA1 = SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName) SPPA1 = SHA1 (PPA1) PPA2 = First8bytesOf (SHA1-HMAC (PrincipalKey, PrincipalName | PrincipalName)) Besides storing the Principal Name(serial number) and Principal Key(online key) in the database, we also store SPPA1 and PPA2. XMACS reads all the rows for all the principal entries and builds up an in memory hash table containing the following 16 bytes in each entry: The first 4 bytes of SHA1 (PrincipalName) The first 4 bytes of SPPA1 All 8 bytes of PPA2 The first 8 of the above 16 bytes is used as the key to the hash table lookup and the remaining 8 byte PPA2 is used after the look up. If memory is tight, the 8 byte PPA2 data can be omitted. PPA Management during Requests During a machine account request, the client builds the pre-pre-auth data structure (XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA) and sends it in the clear to XMACS. Inside the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure, the currentTime is filled in with the current time and PPA1 is also computed and filled in. Instead of directly including PPA2, SPPA2@T is computed and included in the XKERB_PA_XBOX_PPA structure: SPPA2@T = SHA1 (PPA2 | CurrentTime) XMACS can easily compute SHA1 (PrincipalName) and SPPA1 and perform a hash table lookup to find the corresponding entry for every request.  If no entry is found then the request is denied with a kerb error (KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED).  A corresponding log is also made in the event logs under the event id, XEVENT_XMACS_INVALID_PRINCIPAL. If the hash table entry is found, then PPA2 can be retrieved and SPPA2@T can be computed (using the time included in the pre-auth) and verified to match the value sent in. If the included time in the pre-pre-auth is not within a time skew of the current time, then a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error will need to be returned along with the correct current time. The whole PPA2 step can be omitted if memory is tight and only 8 bytes can be stored per entry. PPA Loader Thread XMACS operates differently than the ASKDC when gathering PPA data.  XMACS contains a worker thread that is responsible for reading PPA data whenever signaled.  The thread reads all PPA entries in the Genealogy database on startup, and then sleeps for a specified interval of time.  This thread also accesses a datetime formatted string that represents the  last updated time  for the last entry it read from the database.  The next time XMACS reads from the database it passes this string and tells the Genealogy database to only return entries updated after this datetime.  The stored proc used to read this information from the database is p_xmacs_get_ppadata.  It currently takes the datetime string and returns the top 10,000 rows ( SerialNumber, PPA2, SPPA1, LastUpdated as a 30 character string, LastUpdated as Datetime). Blackbox Hash table This hash table implementation is used by both XMACS and the ASKDC.  The code is located under \xonline\private\crypto\helperlib\DosBlackBox.cpp.  This is a chaining hash table that keys off the given PPA data.  XMACS creates this list at start time allocating a fixed size.  The current size is set to 3 million entries.  As machine genealogy grows so too will this list as well as the requirement for more memory on the XMACS server.  The list is only populated but the PPA loader thread unless devkit entries are enabled (see section 3.5).  When XMACS gets over a set percentage (this is a config value) it will product a warning that the list is getting too big.  XMACS should be reconfigured with a larger list and more memory at this time.  Should the list grow too 99% full then no further entries will be added to the table and an event will be fired with this information. PUID Management Both machine and user accounts require a unique identifier.  Since we are integrated and will be integrating with other services at Microsoft, we have adopted our unique identifier technique from Passport.  This value is a 64 bit integer with the high byte set to 0x0009.  This range of values was assigned to us by the Passport group so we can avoid collisions with other web service accounts while dealing with other service such as SPS (billing).  Both XMACS and XUACS attain configured size buckets of PUIDs at a time.  XMACS/XUACS then provide these PUIDs to every account they create.  All accounts, machine and user, have unique PUIDs assigned from the Xbox PUID range. Database Implementation The database implementation supported by our service was provided to us from the Passport team.  We have a table that is partitioned over a series of databases.  This table is constructed of a bucket number and an integer index.  That index is one greater than the last number given out by this bucket.  To attain PUIDs from any bucket, services use the p_puid_get_next_id stored procedure.  This procedure takes a bucket number (which bucket we want to attain PUID s from) and a block size (usually 256 for our cases) and returns the index number.  The structure of these tables depends on how many partitions are used in the UODB. Due to the complexity of this information it is possible.  Most importantly to note is that no webstore replicas can contain a working copy of the p_puid_get_next_id stored proc.  Once one of the write databases goes down, we cannot allow new PUID buckets to be read from that database s range because we can t be certain that the replication has given the replica accurate information.   The stored procedure p_puid_get_next_id also returns .  This is the best indication that something is wrong with the data in this table.  This can include everything from lost data (someone erased that table) to invalid hash bucket mappings (someone modified information within the table to incorrect values.)  Here are some of the error codes and suggestions on what it means.  Note:  These values are displayed in the XEVENT_XMACS_PUID_THREAD_ERROR event. -1000   Database error.  The executing command failed.  This is a typical failure scenario.  Please contact the database administrator to correct the problem.  This could range from permission settings to missing tables or broken constraints. -1018   Bad Arguments.  This is due to the service trying to attain a bucket less than 1 or greater than 1024.  This should not be seen unless someone chooses to re-configure XMACS.  This can also be due to an invalid hash bucket to partition mapping.  So the desired hash bucket is not on that partition.  If the system was configured properly we should never see this; however, this could also be caused when the PUID table is missing data (someone/something delete rows or the entire table.) -1019   Bad Transaction Count.  This is a database problem.  This stored proc is a transaction that should never see this problem.  Please contact the database administrator or further information. -1020   Bucket depleted.  All the entries in this bucket have been used up.  There are no more PUIDs left to be assigned from the current bucket.  No currently plan exists for this scenario.  XMACS should choose another bucket but we shouldn t see this problem until we re over a few billion users.  Otherwise someone may have corrupted this data. PUID Thread The PUID thread is responsible for gathering blocks of PUIDs from the UODB.  By performing this acquisition through another thread we ensure that no 1 response is responsible for attaining PUID blocks from the UODB.  This process sleeps until all PUIDs are empty in XMACS s PUID block.  Once awakened, this thread will call out to the UODB to attain a new block of PUIDs.  If the UODB is offline or unavailable, this thread will sleep for 5 seconds, then try again.  The thread exists for the life of the XMACS service and is created on startup. DoS Caching Implementation The purpose of this Denial of Service implementation was to block machines from sending too many valid packets to XMACS.  If this machine has returned more than a set number of times we have determined that this might just be a hacker attempting to cause some mischief to the service.  The way we stop this is we keep a hash table of over 100,000 entries that stores all incoming machine accounts and the number of times they ve returned in that last hour.  Once this counter reaches over the set value within an hour, that machine will not long receive a reply for an account from XMACS.  The machine serial number and IP are logged in the event log as violating the  maximum allowance  setting.   This list basically acts like a  most recent  queue.  The most recently serviced machine account is always at the head of the list.  This list never grows in size.  It simply reuses nodes from the end of the list.  Should that node already contain information, XMACS will check the lifetime of the node and re-use if expired.  If it has not expired, XMACS throws an event claiming that it needs a bigger DoS cache table. Stages and Caching This implementation also caches machine account creation data for a limited time.  This is split into 2 stages: Principle validation (stage 1)   This is where XMACS gets the machines entry from the Genealogy database, decrypts it and sends it to the KDC.  The cache helps XMACS to avoid the call to the database and nCipher device if the processes have already occurred within the stage one cache lifetime.  XMACS stores the key value, in memory, of the key that was decrypted. PreAuth construction (stage 2)   At this point the KDC Core has validated that the incoming request is from a valid machine.  At this point XMACS builds the machine account in the UODB and sends the user the response.  The cache stores this response for the stage 2 cache lifetime.  If the machine returns again within that lifetime, XMACS will simply resend the same packet of information.  This removes the need for XMACS to make more calls to the XMACSFD to set up a machine account. Concurrency Model This implementation is rather complex since it does not rely on critical sections, semaphores or events.  For a list of this size, we can t possibly allocate that many resources.  And we can t use one lock around everything since it would cause a major performance hit.   As a result, we decided to create a special locking system for each node.  The nodes all have an owner DWORD variable.  To lock the node, we first grab a critical section then assign the DWORD value of that node to the owner threads id.  No other thread can access this node until it is released or its timeout has expired.  Threads that attempt to access this node for the same machine are simply cancelled and return no reply.  The timeout was necessary for cases where nodes where controlled by a thread hung in a limbo state.  This way XMACS can reclaim the node should it need the memory to continue processing accounts.  If the hung thread should suddenly awake again, we do have checks to ensure that is still has the node.  If it does not have the node it simply dies without producing a response. If the node has no owner, the DWORD is set to 0.  At that point, if a thread decides that want to use that node, they can claim it. Key Management In order to protect sensitive information within our database (UODB), we have implemented a dedicated key management system which servers to protect vital data.  Now should database information somehow leak from our environments, it would be extremely difficult to decrypt/decipher this data.  For further directions and information about the key management setup for Xbox Live please see Tony Chen Xbox Online Authentication  document.  Master Key The master key is a 2048 bit private key.  It protects raw service keys in the UODB.  For XMACS s purposes, this key protects the  key encryption key  which is stored in the t_service_keys table.  The master key is installed during the server setup.  It exists on a CD rom that is locked way when not in use.  The key is installed on the machine using XKEYMGR.  The key manager uses the crypto API to store the master key somewhere on the harddrive.  For the XMACS service to read this key, the Master key must be installed by a user in the same group.  During startup, XMACS will use the crypto API to attain this key for decrypting the key encryption key.  Key Encryption Key During startup, XMACS reads the encrypted key encryption key from t_service_keys.  When this key is decrypted with the master key we get a 32 byte AES symmetric key.  The key encryption key is a symmetric key because it provides a faster, yet still very secure, method of encrypting data.  The trade-off for this implementation is that we also need to store the key version and IV so we can decrypt this data later.  The key encryption key is used to encrypt user and machine passwords as well as billing information.  For XMACS s purposes, we simply encrypt the machines key and store it in the UODB.

Initialization Management Settings The following is a list of all ini file settings with a description of the role each plays in the XMACS system. UseNCipher   Tells XMACS to run the code path that performs the nCipher decription.  The default is set to 1 meaning that XMACS will use the nCipher device code path. DOSStage1CacheTimeout   The cache timeout for stage 1 (machine verification data).  When this cache expires, it also expires the second cache.  Usually this value is set to a much higher time limit.  The current default is 6 hours. DOSStage2CacheTimeout   The cache timeout for stage 2 (pre-auth data).  This cache value is usually set to a much lower value.  It should always be less than the VIP affinity(sticky) on sites where there are more than 1 XMACS machine. MaxAllowancePerHour   The maximum number of machine account requests a machine can make in an hour.  The default is 20. PUIDBlockSize   The total number of PUIDs that should be acquired from the UODB at one time.=256 Domain   This is the suffix domain created on machine accounts. (Do we still use this?  Look into it) KeyEncryptionKeyVersion   This is the key encryption key version that XMACS should use to encrypt information from the database. WebStoreBuckets   The total number of buckets in webstore.  This is required for PUID generation so XMACS can choose which bucket to attain PUID blocks from. AcceptDevKits   the flag to tell XMACS to permit Xbox devkits to create a machine account.  This flag basically allows the devkit solution to pass through PPA DoS protection. ClientRetryInterval   hmmm  if someone finds out what I use this value for please inform me. PPAMaxEntries   The maximum number of entries permitted in the PPA black box hash table. PPALoaderSleeptimeInSecs   The amount of time in seconds that the PPA loader thread should sleep. HashListPercentageWarning   The percentage threshold for hash table over-flow warning. (%) DisableDoS   This setting allows us to turn off the DoS cache feature.  All entries will be permitted to enter XMACS as many times as they d like.  This option is usually commented out and defaults to false (0). Genealogy SqlServerName   the IP address of the genealogy SQL server box. SqlServerDb   The name of the Genealogy database. SqlServerUid   The user name to enter for SQL auth.  If this entry and the password entry fail to exist, NT authentication is used instead. SqlServerPwd   The SQL authentication password for the defined user.  If this entry and the password entry fail to exist, NT authentication is used instead. ConnectTimeout   The connection time out the the genealogy db in seconds. FrontDoors HttpServer   The hostname or IP address of the front doors.  Note that more than one front door can be added at a time.  Use a comma delimiter to separate entries. HttpObjectName   This is the name of the front door interface point.  It is currently configured MachineLookupRequest   This is the URL presented to the front door to do a machine lookup in the t_machines table.  The request give a PUID and gets back the machines block date and reset date. MachineNameLookupRequest -- This does a machine account lookup in the t_user_names table.  It is given the machines name (SN.############) and returns the PUID for that account.  MachineInsertNameRequest   This query adds machine information to the UODB.  The machine name/account is created in the t_user_names/t_user_keys tables.   The procedure call  takes all account information including name, PUID and key information. MachineResetRequest   This call makes a machine account password reset.  It takes the machine PUID This call makes a machine account password reset.  It takes the machines name and key information and makes the correction in t_user_keys. MachineUpdateRequest   Updates the machines reset date in t_machines.  Note:  If the account does not already exist in t_machines then create the entry. PUIDLookup   The PUID thread makes this call to the UODB.  The result is a block of PUIDs equal to the size specified in PUIDBlockSize.  KeyEncryptionKeyLookup   This query will get the encrypted version of the key encryption key and its key version. WinHttp ResolveTimeoutMillis   The timeout used by WinHttp for resolving a host name. ConnectTimeoutMillis   The WinHttp connection timeout setting in milliseconds.  This is the maximum amount of time WinHttp will wait to connect to the given host. SendTimeoutMillis   The maximum wait time WinnHttp will wait for host to acknowledge ReceiveTimeoutMillis   The WinHttp timeout setting, in milliseconds, for receiving a response from host.   KdcPolicy TimeSkewSeconds -- Specify the allowed time skew interval (in seconds).  Please see KDC documentation for better description. Logging Areas List the relevant areas.  Mention what they log and at what levels.  Management Console Standard Commands Logging and tracing help:   GetVersion   gets the build version of the program.  I think   ListAreas   Lists logging areas of the service   ListTargets   List all target areas for this service.  (Like remote tracing or text logging)   ChangeAreaLevel <area name> <level = 0,1,2,3,4>    Changes the logging level of a certain area.   NewTarget <target name> <target parameters>     where <target parameters> can be:        type=File;prefix=<filename prefix>;RotationTime=<time in minutes>        type=Remote;address=<ip or hostname of rtrace terminal> creates a new target.   DeleteTarget <target name>   Deletes the logging target.   AddTarget <target name> <area name>   Adds a target to receive messages from a logging area.   RemoveTarget <target name> <area name>   Removes a target from receiving messages from a logging area.   ResetTarget <target name>   Resets the connection to a target.

KDC Management Commands XMACS provider help:   reload   Causes XMACS to reload values including Key encryption key settings,     uptime   Gets the total amount of time the server has been up and running.   ListFrontDoors   Lists the front doors that the service knows about and they re current status.   QueryBlackBox <name = "Dark Master">     Queries the services black box to determine if the name exists. XMACS Exclusive Commands   QueryDoSCache <name = "239581239912">   Queries XMACSs secondary cache to determine if a machine has already created an account with XMACS.   SetKEKVersion <version number = "1"> -- Allows us to modify the accepted key encryption key version read from the config file.  Note that this change is not accepted until a reload is performed on XMACS. This area is designed for quick answers to vague issues that occur with XMACS.  As I notice more problems I ll add more details to this area. 1.  I have new genealogy information that I need loaded right away, how do I do this? (a)  Add these genealogy rows to the Genealogy database in the desired environment. (b)  Using xmgmtc.exe, connect to the XMACS machines in that environment. (c)  type  e :xmacs reload This causes XMACS to re-read data from the UODB.  However, it also causes XMACS to get a new bucket of PUIDs so don t use this method unless it is absolutely necessary. 2.  How do I change the key encryption key version for XMACS without restarting the system? (a)  Using xmgmtc.exe, connect to the XMACS machines in that environment. (b)  type  e :xmacs SetKEKVersion   + the new key encryption key version number   (c)  type  e :xmacs reload The first statement sets the value of the key encryption key setting.  The reload forces XMACS to use this change. 3.  How do I get XMACS to attain a new block of PUIDs? (a)  Using xmgmtc.exe, connect to the XMACS machines in that environment. (b)  type  e :xmacs reload XMACS will get a new block of PUIDs once this command is issued.

It will outline configuration facts about this execution, information that is displayed and the significance of this data.  The XMACS logging area follows guides set for Xbox Live servers defined in the document:  HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/LogPrinciples.doc"  http://sts/xbox_online/Dev/LogPrinciples.doc Please reference this document for more details on why log data is presented in a specific format. Configuration XMACS utilizes the Xmgmt libraries for to produce logging records.  As a result, XMACS logging details can be managed from the XMGMT interface or xmacs.ini file.  The logging area is: XMACSLog This area only produces messages for logging purposes.  Other areas exists which provide more in-depth descriptions of errors.   Data Format XMACS provides 3 different log line entries to express the flow of information.  These 3 areas can be identified by their prefix marker.  The information following this marker gives an indication of a successful or failed execution.  The 3 entries are: Account Creation FORMAT:  ACC|serial number|kerb error|DWORD Status|IP|PUID  Prefix log identifier for machine account creation.  This item appears just as presented. serial number   At most 12 characters presented in the name field of the Kerberos request.  These 12 characters should be numeric and represent the Xbox s serial number that is sending the request. kerb error   The error value associated with the request.  This value should be 0 (KDC_ERR_NONE) for successful machine account creations.  Non-zero otherwise. DWORD Status   This value is a bit string that contains details of what path was taken to create the machine account and an indication of where failures may be occuring.  The meaning of each bit is defined in section 4.  This is the IP address of the Xbox that sent the machine account creation request. PUID   This is the PUID assigned to the newly created machine account.  Note that if the process should fail before the PUID is assigned then this value will be 0. PUID Management FORMAT:  PUI|HResult|range|size  Prefix log identifier for PUID management.  This item appears just as presented. HResult   Represents the error status from the PUID threads attempt to get a new PUID range.  This value is S_OK when successful. range   The first value of the newly acquired PUID range.  This value will be 0 if the process fails. size   This value represents the number of PUIDs available starting from the range. Pre-PreAuth Data Management FORMAT:  PPA|HResult|Number Of Rows Loaded|LastUpdatedTime  Prefix log identifier for PPA data loading.  This item appears just as presented. HResult   Represents the error status from the PPA loader thread after reading from the Genealogy database.  This value is S_OK when successful. Number Of Rows Loaded   the number of new PPA genealogy rows loaded from Genealogy database. LastUpdatedTime   This is a time value that corresponds with the last updated time on the last PPA entry read from the database.  This is the value that will be used to get new PPA entries when the thread wakes up again. DWORD Format Logging lines associated to machine account creation requests(ACC) will produce a special DWORD that indicated that status and path taken to create this machine account.  This DWORD is a bit string.  The connotations of these bits are defined as follows: Position Meaning REQSTAT_INVALIDSTATE   XMACS has run into an unexpected error during account creation REQSTAT_DEPENDENCY_CONNECTION_FAILURE   XMACS has failed to connect to one of its dependencies.

Any difference is a possible backwards compatiblity issue and should be filed as a bug. xmatchhost.srf Create or update a matchmaking session. xmatchhostdelete.srf Delete a matchmaking session. xmatchclient.srf Search for matchmaking sessions Xenon Interfaces The following XRLs are used by Xenon clients to create, update, search for, and delete matchmaking sessions. Their functionality is close to the similarly named Legacy Xbox Interfaces, but some additional features have been added, and some have been removed. Note, the limits below have not changed:         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_RESULTS                   = 50;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_ATTRIBUTE_DATA                  = 4096; These limits have been raised by 10 to account for the 10 additional built in attributes and parameters that are automatically included in every schema and sent with every query.         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_PARAMS                    = 30;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_TITLE_SCHEMA_ATTRS              = 50; Note that new datatypes are now allowed: contexts, plus properties of type: int64, int32, float32, float64, datetime. If the old X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK is zero, then look in the top nibble for extended xenon subtype.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK                   = 0x00F00000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER                = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_STRING                 = 0x00100000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_BLOB                   = 0x00200000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL                   = 0x00F00000;         // Xenon supports the extended datatypes below. In order to not change the         // protocol for existing clients, these extended types are all considered         // to be X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER by this class. The front door          // checks these extended bits (which were previously unused)          // to interpret each of the 64 bit chunks of type INTEGER correctly.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_MASK                = 0x70000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_CONTEXT             = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT32              = 0x10000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT64              = 0x20000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT64             = 0x30000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT32             = 0x50000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_DATETIME            = 0x70000000; All extended xenon datatypes look like datatype integer, which means they take 64 bits on the wire. Contexts are interpreted as 64 bit ints. Int32, the top 32 bits are ignored Int64 is interpreted as 64 bit integer float32, top 32 bits are ignored, low 32 bits are interpreted as single precision IEEE floating point value. float64, 64 bits intepreted as double precision IEEE floating point value. Test Note: We should make sure we check that 32 bit integers and floating point values with a 1 in the most significant bit are handled properly. See database.cs DBLayer.Pack64BitsWithFloat, Pack64BitsWithDouble, Interpret64BitsAsFloat, Interpret64BitsAsDouble Datetimes are represented on the wire as FILETIME structures in UTC. See DateTime.ToFileTimeUtc, DateTime.FromFileTimeUtc. Blob attributes and parameters are not allowed by any xenon interface. String attributes and paramaters are not allowed to be passed as search parameters, may not be used in filters or sort operations, but may be passed in session host and session update calls, and may be returned as a schema attribute in search calls. Note that xlast will restrict the use of string attributes to only the host s gamertag, so we avoid the issue of terms of use violations with user entered strings being advertized in match. The order of parameters and attributes on the wire is not significant for Xbox 360 interfaces. All attributes and parameters are completely identified by their id, and therefore can be specified in any order, both in calls from the client to the server, and in search results from the server to the client. The absence of an expected id is interpreted as NULL, which is allowed for all attributes and parameters except for gametype and gamemode, which are required. If attribute id X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL (0x00F00000) is still valid, but has no effect. If it is passed from the client to the server, it does not generate an error. NULL attributes in search results will be represented with X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL to remain consistent with the behavior of prior releases. This attribute id can appear multiple times in one call or search result. While the attribute order in search results should not be relevant to the client, the current implementation returns attributes in search results in the order they appear in xlast, and inserts X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL for any missing attributes. This allows the front door to share more code between the Xbox and Xbox 360 code paths. xmatchhost2.ashx Session Create If the session id passed on the wire is all zeros, except for the bits that encode the session type (0x00000000000000F0), then the call is interpreted as a session create operation. Session create does not allow blob schema attributes, but does does allow strings attributes. If the session type is XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK the call will be fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_FLAGS The following attributes must be passed on the wire for all create calls. If any are missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) The following attribute may be passed, but has no effect. If it is missing, the create session call will still succeed: X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID (0x20008107) If an attribute id is passed that is not part of the title s schema, and is not one of the automatic ids listed above, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID All title defined schema attributes are optional and may be omitted. Session Update If the session id passed on the wire is non zeros, in any bit that is not the session type (0x00000000000000F0), then the call is interpreted as a session update operation. If the session id is not valid, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_SESSION_ID Changing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) in an update is not allowed. This parameter may be passed, but iuf the value has been changed, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM The following attributes may be passed. If they are present, the value in the database is update to reflect the value passed in the call. If they are omitted, then the current value in the database remains unchanged. X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) Any title defined attributes may also be passed. If they are present, the value in the database is update to reflect the value passed in the call. If they are omitted, then the current value in the database remains unchanged. If an attribute id is passed that is not part of the title s schema, and is not one of the automatic ids listed above, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID xmatchhostdelete2.ashx No attributes should be passed to this call. If the session id passed is not valid, or is not present in the database, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_SESSION_ID xmatchclient2.ashx The system FindById search query expects only one parameter: X_ATTRIBUTE_SESSION_ID (0x20008003). If this parameter is missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM. If any other parameters are sent, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID. The system FindById query is query id 0xFFFFFFFF. All non FindById query calls must pass the following parameters. If any are missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID (0x20008107) Title defined parameters may be omitted without error. If any parameters are passed that are not in the list above, and are not in the list of title defined parameters for that query, then the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID. Note that parameters to search queries should not specify the X_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PARAM bit flag. This flag s only purpose was to help xbox1 xmltosql figure out if an attribute was being used as a parameter or attribute. Xlast and LiveMatch use a different method. Therefore this flag is not used anywhere for Xbox 360 titles. No string or blob paramaters are allowed in search queries for Xbox 360 titles. No aggregate queries are allowed for Xbox 360 titles. No title defined FindById queries are allowed for Xbox 360 titles. Only the system generated FindById query is supported. Internal Interfaces These are only called by the SG or internal tools, therefore no back compat work required. deadxbox.ashx No changes. Same XRL. titlechange.ashx No changes.

Same XRL Ranked Matchmaking Ranked matchmaking is for users who are in a competitive mood, and want to have a competitive game against people who are similar to them in skill, and want the results to be reflected in their public global ranking. The fun in a ranked match comes from the competition, and therefore the goal is to find a session filled with players of similar skill. Ranked matchmaking is used for sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE is 0. Creating a session where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 creates a ranked session. Searching for sessions and passing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 as a parameter searches for ranked sessions. Searching for ranked sessions returns N rows, where N is equal to the Max Results entered in xlast for the query id being used. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet any title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast The results are ordered by the probability of a draw occuring between the user identified as the host of the session and the user identified as searching for the session, based on the host s skill   EMBED Equation.3    and the searcher s skill   EMBED Equation.3   , according to the following calculation:  EMBED Equation.3   Note: the more sophisticated and accurate equation below was used initially, but during optimization we found we needed to use the simpler equation above for performance reasons.   EMBED Equation.3   Also note that the parameter  EMBED Equation.3   is fixed at 0.5 for the Xbox Live service, which means   EMBED Equation.3   reduces to 0.5, and the calcuation above reduces to:  EMBED Equation.3   The host s skill is passed to the match server in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA attributes in the create session call, and may be updated in the update session call. The searcher s skill is passed to the match server in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA attributes in the search query itself. Introduction to the MuSigma Ranking System  and  Notes on the MuSigma Matchmaking  papers for more information on how the skill ranking system works. If there are many candidate sessions to consider, it is not computationally efficient to calculate and sort by the draw probability above for all the candidate sessions. Therefore a method is required to reduce the set of sessions that will be considered and presented to the sort operation in an efficient manner. To do this we select a  small  range of   EMBED Equation.3   , and run an efficient query to determine the number of rows that would be considered if we used that  small  range of   EMBED Equation.3   . If that does not yeild enough rows, we broaden the range of   EMBED Equation.3   , and try again. We continue this process until enough rows will be considered, or we are considering the entire range of   EMBED Equation.3   During optimization, we experimented with various definitions of a  small range enough rows broader range , until we found a combination that was efficient but still yeilded acceptable results. The ranges of   EMBED Equation.3    attempted, in order, are:  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.0234375  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.046875  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.09375  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.1875  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.375  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.75  EMBED Equation.3   = 1.5  EMBED Equation.3   The range is centered around  EMBED Equation.3   , unless that would extend beyond the allowed values of   EMBED Equation.3    which is [0, 6] inclusive, which case the range will start at 0 or end at 6. As an optimization, if the number of rows returned by one of the ranges above is less than 2, instead of using the next range in the chart above, it skips the next range and tries the range two below the current range. The search terminates when the entire range is being searched, or when at least (MaxResults * 2) rows are returned, where MaxResults is the maximum number of results the title has configured the particular query to return. Note that the starting point of the search is chosen to support what we believe will be the number of concurrently available sessions for our most popular titles. If this estimate is wrong, the initial range will need to be adjusted to start using a more negative exponent. Also note that the general form of the range calculations is   EMBED Equation.3   where C is a constant chosen based on the allowed range of the parameter in question (in this case 0 to 6), and b is the base of an exponent, and i is the iteration of the search. Different values of B, and different starting points of i will be apporpriate for different goals. In our first attempt at this algorithm, we were search for a range of sessions between 100 and 1000, and selected b=5, and initial i = -5. We found via stress testing that it was more important to get an accurate range than it was to reduce the number of iterations, which is why we now search for a value that yeilds between maxresults*2 and maxresults*4 rows, and use b=2 and initial i =-7. If the range of mu selected by the previous algorithm does not reduce the set of sessions to be maxresults*4 or less, the server will further restrict the number of sessions that will be sorted by randomly discarding a percentage of the sessions such that approximately maxresults*3 sessions will be considered. Title defined sort operations are supported, and will be applied prior to the draw probability sort described above. This is not recommended, because if there are more than one or two possible values for the title defined sort criteria, the draw probability sort will have almost no effect on the ordering of the sessions. Also note that if mu is not valid for a particular title (likely because that developer has chosen to implement their own concept of skill and disabled ours), then the process of choosing a mu range will have no effect, and the candidate sessions presented to the sort operation will be a random selection of available sessions. This will also hurt performance, because the random selection is not as efficient as the mu range selection, because it does not make use of the clustered index on the table. Standard (Casual? Social?) Matchmaking Standard Matchmaking is for users who are in a mood where winning and losing is less important than finding a session filled with people they enjoy playing with. The following factors are used in an attempt to find a session populated by compatible people. Who is on the user s friends list? Who has the user submitted positive feedback on? Who has the user completed games with in the past? Who has the user submitted negative feedback on? Who has submitted negative feedback on the user? What gamer zone did the user select? What gamer zone did the host select? What is the user s gamer rating? What is the host s gamer rating? What country did the user select? What country did the host select? What language did the user select? What language did the host select?  Standard matchmaking is used for sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE is 1. Creating a session where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 creates a standard session. Searching for sessions and passing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 as a parameter searches for standard sessions. Searching for standard sessions returns N rows, where N is equal to the Max Results entered in xlast for the query id being used. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet any title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast Conceptually, a standard matchmaking query can be thought of as a series of queries, each one slightly broader that the previous query, until enough results have been collected. Each query pass is described below: Pass 0 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in the same gamer zone Pass 1 Sessions with no negative affiliations (e.g. avoided players), in the same gamer zone, same language and same country Pass 2 Sessions with no negative affiliations (e.g. avoided players), in the same gamer zone, but having a different language, country, or both Pass 3 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in a different gamer zone Pass 4 Sessions with no negative affiliations (e.g. avoided players), in a different gamer zone Each pass adds to the result set. Sessions from Pass 0 are returned at the top of the results list, followed by sessions from Pass 1, then Pass 2, then Pass 3, then Pass 4. Affiliation Value of a Session One of the primary goals of standard matchmaking is to increase the probability of placing people in sessions with people they prefer, and decrease the probability of placing them in sessions with people they would rather not play with. There are five types of affiliations between players that standard matchmaking takes into consideration: Friend: I added a person to my Friends list Positive Feedback: I submitted positive feedback on a person Completed Game: I have completed a game with a person in the past Negative Feedback: I have submitted negative feedback on a person Avoiding Me: A person submitted negative feedback on me The following statements, based on the affiliations above, are consistent with the concept of standard matchmaking: A session with one Friend and several strangers is better than a session with one Positive Feedback and several strangers. A session with one Positive Feedback and several strangers is better than a session with one Completed Game and several strangers. A session with one Completed Game and several strangers is better than a session with only strangers A session with one Negative Feedback is worse than a session with only strangers A session with one Avoiding Me is worse than a session with only straingers In practice, the matchmaking service must be able to evaluate the relative merit of sessions like this: A session with one Friend, and one Negative Feedback A session with two Positive Feedback and one Negative Feedback A session with one Friend, two Postivie Feedback, three Completed Game, one Negative Feedback, and two Avoiding Me Negative Feedback and Avoiding Me affiliations are not absolute. It is acceptable to be matched into a session that contains people you submitted negative feedback on, or people who submitted negative feedback on you, as long as the   outweighs the  The affiliation value of each session that contains affiliates will be calculated using the following formula: session_value = (4 * # of Friends) + (2 * # of Positive Feedback) + (1 * # of Completed Game)   (3 * # of Negative Feedback)   (3 * # of Avoiding Me) Using this equation, a session with one Friend and one Negative Feedback is as positive as a session with one Completed Game player. But it takes two Positive Feedback players to outweigh one Negative Feedback. This will avoid the situation where matchmaking does not offer you a session that has lots of people you like, and only one you don The coefficients in the equation shown here are a starting point. The coefficients will be configuable via in the following settings in npdb. The values must be integer. Since the absolute value of the session has no meaning, we can use larger coefficients to obtain a more precise balance between the five factors without resorting to floating point calculations. xmatchfd_valueOfFriend (initial value 4) xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer (initial value 2) xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted (initial value 1) xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid (initial value -3) xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe (initial value -3) Note that it is possible for user A to be affiliated with user B in more than one way. For example, the first time you complete a game with someone, they will be added as a Completed Game affiliate. If you then submit positive feedback on them, they will be both a Completed Game and a Positive Feedback affiliate. If you then add them as a friend, they will be a Completed Game, Positive Feedback, and Friend affiliate. Note however that Completed Game and Positive Feedback are finite lists. Eventually, an active player could fill their lists, and the Completed Game and Positive Feedback affiliations will disappear. There is one exception to this rule. It is not possible to be both a Positive Feedback and Negative Feedback affiliate of the same user. The presence service removes any Negative Feedback affiliation if you submit Positive Feedback, and vice versa. If a user has multiple affiliations, then each of those affiliations is considered independantly for the purposes of calculating the affiliate value of a session. For example, using the initial values above, a user who is both a Completed Game and Positive Feedback affiliate would contribute +3 to the affiliate value of a session, exactly the same as one Completed Game affiliate and one Positive Feedback affiliate. Pass 0 Pass 0 returns search results with a positive affiliation value in the same gamer zone. The match front door requests the affiliates list from Presence for the user puid passed in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID parameter to the match query. The list returned from presence is an array of structures that look like this: struct P_QUERY_AFFILIATES_REPLY_DATA_MSG  ULONGLONG qwAffiliateID;  DWORD dwListFlags;  DWORD dwTitleID;  ULONGLONG qwSessionID;  MSGTIME mtDateUpdated;  char szGamerTag[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE]; dwListFlags tells the match front door which list(s) the affiliate is on. Only affilates who are online and in the same title are returned by presence to the match front door. The total affilicates list is currently limited to 1500 entries, so the size of the list returned to the match front door will be no larger than 1500 records, and will usually be much smaller. The front door will create a hashtable of sessions and their values according to the psuedocode below: Create HashTable to store session information foreach entry in affiliates list     if sessionid is not in session list, add it with a value of 0     if affiliate is a friend         add xmatchfd_valueOfFriend to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a positive feedback         add xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a completed game         add xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an negative feedback         add xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid from the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an avoiding me         add xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe from the sessionid s value convert the hashtable to an array sort the array by session value using QuickSort Using the algorithm above, the front door can calculate the values of all the sessions for all the affiliates online in O(n), convert the hashtable to an array in O(n), and then quicksort that array in O(n lg n) on average, O(n^2) worst case. The front door now queries all match sql databases configured for the title to retrieve all the sessions that: are in the list of affiliate session ids with a value of 0 or greater have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE equal to 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE equal to the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE parameter in the query have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE equal to the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE parameter in the query have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet all title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast The results are ordered by the affiliate value of the session, in decreasing order (i.e. large affiliate values first). If the number of results is equal to or greater than max results specified for this query in the xlast file, then these sessions are returned without further processing. Pass 1 Pass 0 returns session with no affiliations, in the same gamer zone, with the same language and same country. If more than the required number of sessions are available, the query considers the gamer rating of the host and the client when deciding which rows to return to the client. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE passed as a parameter have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ LANGUAGE passed as a parameter have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ LANGUAGE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ LANGUAGE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet all title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast As with ranked matches, we needed a way to reduce the number of rows being considered when there are a large number of candidate sessions. We therefore use the same algorithm described in the previous section to reduce the number of sessions considered in an efficient way, but we use X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING instead of the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU. Since the rating has a different range [0..100] than mu [0..6], the ranges searched are different, but the method is identical. The ranges searched, in order, are:  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.390625  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.78125  EMBED Equation.3   = 1.5625  EMBED Equation.3   = 3.125  EMBED Equation.3   = 6.25  EMBED Equation.3   = 12.5  EMBED Equation.3    EMBED Equation.3   As with the ranked match case, if more than resultsNeeded*4 rows are returned by the algorithm above, then sessions are randomly discarded so that approximately resultsNeeded *3 sessions will be considered. Note that resultsNeeded is not the same as maxresults. See below for a discussion of how the number of sessions needed is calculated. Once a range of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING has been selected, the rows that pass all the filters, including the range check, will be sorted as follows. Within the set of considered sessions, title defined sort operations will be applied. Within each of the groupings created by the title defined sort operations, rows will be ordered by the same draw probability calculation used for ranked matchmaking. Note that some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they are actually affiliate sessions with a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0). Some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door may also be affiliate sessions with a positive affiliate value, in which case they will be duplicates of sessions already added to the result set in Pass 0. For this reason, the front door will ask the SQL server for more results than it needs in order to complete the results set. (This is the resultsNeeded discussed above). The front door knows at the end of Pass 0 how many slots in the result set have been filled, and how many remain to be filled. The front door also knows how many negative affiliate sessions there are. The maximum number of sessions that could possibly be filtered out by the front door is (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions). Therefore the front door asks the SQL query to return, at most (# of open slots) + (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions), which simplifys to (max_results) + (# of negative sessions). Example: Pass 0 generated a session value hashtable containing 100 entries. 75 of those entries had a value of 0 or greater, and 25 had a value of less than 0. Of the 75 sessions with a value of zero or greater, 15 were returned by the Pass 0 SQL query (i.e. they were available, had a compatible nat type, were in the correct gamer zone, were the correct GAME_MODE, and GAME_TYPE, and met any title defined criteria). Therefore, 10 slots remain to be filled. The front door needs, at most, (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) = 25 + 25 = 50 results back from the Pass 1 SQL query. Assuming 50 or more sessions exist that meet the Pass 1 criteria, this will be enough to fill the remaining slots, even if 15 of them are duplicates of the results already in the result set, and 25 of them are filtered out because their affiliation value is negative. 10 sessions would still remain, which added to the 15 sessions from pass 0, equals max_results. In practice, the sql query already knows max_results, so the front door simply supplies the stored proc with the number of negative affiliate sessions. Pass 2 Pass 2 is identical to Pass 1, except that the resultsNeeded is reduced by the number of rows that were returned in Pass 1, and that only those sessions which are in the same gamer zone, but have either a different country or language (or both) will be returned. Within the Pass 2 result set the results are ordered as follows: Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE is equal to the client values are returned first. Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY is equal to the client values are returned next. Sessions where neither X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE nor X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY are equal to the client values are returned last. Within each of these groupings, the title defined sort operations are applied, followed by the draw probability sort. Pass 3 Pass 2 requeries the match sql database to find all positive affiliate sessions that are in a different gamer zone than the client. The affiliate values do not need to be recalculated. The results of Pass 3 are ordered by the affiliate value of each session in descending order (i.e. larger values first). Because Pass 0 and Pass 3 act on exactly the same information, to avoid an extra database round trip, the queries for Pass 0 and Pass 3 are combined into one  affiliates  query to the database. If the results from Pass 3 are not required because Pass 0, Pass 1, and Pass 2 have generated enough results, they are simply discarded by the front door. Pass 4 If Pass 4 is similar to Pass 1, except that it returns sessions that are in a different gamer zone and does not exclude sessions with a different language or country, and resultsNeeded is reduced by the number of sesions returned by Pass 1 and Pass 2. Within the Pass 4 result set the results are ordered as follows: Sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY are equal to the client values are returned first. Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE is equal to the client values are returned next. Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY is equal to the client values are returned next. Sessions where neither X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE nor X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY are equal to the client values are returned last. Within each of these groupings, the title defined sort operations are applied, followed by the draw probability sort. Because Pass 1, Pass 2, and Pass 4 act on exactly the same information, to avoid extra database round trips, the queries for Pass 1, Pass 2 and Pass 4 are combined into one query to the database. However, because the query knows how many results the front door is looking for (max_results + # of negative sessions), the stored proc is able to exit after performing the work for Pass 1 or Pass 2 if it knows there will be enough results to satisfy the front door. MultiServer Issues If a title is spans multiple match SQL servers, the affiliate session queries in Pass 0 and Pass 3 must be performed against all the SQL partitions for that titleid. The non-affiliate session queries in Pass 1, Pass 2, and Pass 4 will be performed against one SQL server only. The Pass 1, Pass 2, and Pass 4 search queries for a particular title will cycle through the SQL partitions on a round robin basis. It should be noted that spanning a title across multiple servers reduces the effectiveness of matchmaking, because the queries are being performed on a subset of the total sessions available. If all sessions are present on one SQL server, it is possible to return the best sessions to the client, instead of a random subset of the best sessions. Match Database Design Datatypes The following table shows how xlast datatypes are mapped to T-SQL, C#, and wiredata representations. Xlast Type Name T-SQL Data Type C# type Wiredata DateTime (8 bytes) DATETIME DateTime 64 bit unsigned long integer Float (4 bytes) float 64 bit unsigned long integer Integer (4 bytes) 64 bit unsinged long integer Long Float (8 bytes) FLOAT double 64 bit unsinged long integer Long Integer (8 bytes) BIGINT 64 bit unsinged long integer String ** supported only for gamer tag NVARCHAR(400) string 2 byte length prefix + up to 400 bytes of UTF8 encoded character data (not 400 character, 400 bytes) plus 1 byte null terminator. Blob ** not allowed for xbox 360 titles VARBINARY(800) byte[] 2 byte length prefix + up to 800 bytes of binary data (no terminator) Session Tables Each title will have two session tables; one for ranked matches and one for standard matches. We choose to separate the sessions into two tables because the clustered index required for ranked queries to perform well is different from the clustered index required for standard matches to perform well. The definition of the standard table looks like this:     CREATE TABLE dbo.t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          bi_session_id           bigint                  NOT NULL         ,i_ip_addr               int                     NOT NULL         ,i_sg_ip                 int                     NOT NULL         ,b_box_id                binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,b_host_address          binary(36)              NOT NULL         ,b_key_exchange_key      binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,i_public_available      int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_available     int                     NOT NULL         ,i_public_current        int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_current       int                     NOT NULL         ,dt_session_expiration   datetime                NOT NULL         ,ti_is_available         tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,i_hash                  int                     NOT NULL         ,ti_nat_type             tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800A          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800B          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008101          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008102          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008103          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x50008104          real NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008105          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008106          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x10000001          int         CONSTRAINT t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_pk PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED                     (bi_session_id),     )     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_ndx on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          ti_is_available         ,att_0x0000800B         ,att_0x50008104         ,bi_session_id     )     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_ndx_boxid_nc on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          b_box_id     )          There are a number of universal columns with descriptive names, followed by a number of universal columns named for the attributes ids: X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) All of these are defined as NOT NULL. Following these universal columns are the title defined columns. Note that the title may provide game type and game mode in xlast. If they do, those attributes will not be duplicated, but instead will simply be ignored in favor of the built in definitions above. The primary key is bi_session_id, and is non-clustered. This non-clustered index will provide reasonably efficient bookmark lookups for FindById queries and affiliate session lookups. There is another non clustered index on b_box_id. This is used to delete sessions in a reasonably efficient manner when processing Dead SG and Dead Xbox messages. The clustered index is on ti_is_available, game mode, gamer rating, and session id. Game type is not included in the clustered index, since it will always be the same in this table. Any single query will always be restricted to sessions that are available, in particular game type and game mode. Putting these three columns at the beginning of the clustered index ensures that the sessions that will be considered by any one search query are on contiguous pages in the database. Gamer rating is part of the clustered index so we can efficiently determine what range of ratings should be used to generate the appropriate number of rows to present to the order by clause in a query. The session id is added to the end of the clustered index to guarantee uniqueness. If we didn t do this, SQL server would add an internal hidden column containing a guid to guanratee uniqueness, which would be less efficient than simply using session id. The definition of the ranked table is almost identical:     CREATE TABLE dbo.t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          bi_session_id           bigint                  NOT NULL         ,i_ip_addr               int                     NOT NULL         ,i_sg_ip                 int                     NOT NULL         ,b_box_id                binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,b_host_address          binary(36)              NOT NULL         ,b_key_exchange_key      binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,i_public_available      int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_available     int                     NOT NULL         ,i_public_current        int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_current       int                     NOT NULL         ,dt_session_expiration   datetime                NOT NULL         ,ti_is_available         tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,i_hash                  int                     NOT NULL         ,ti_nat_type             tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800A          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800B          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008101          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008102          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008103          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x50008104          real NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008105          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008106          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x10000001          int         CONSTRAINT t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_pk PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED                     (bi_session_id),     )     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_ndx on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          ti_is_available         ,att_0x0000800B         ,att_0x30008105         ,bi_session_id     )     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_ndx_boxid_nc on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          b_box_id     ) Other than the table and index names the only significant difference is the clustered index. Instead of gamer rating, the clustered index includes gamer mu. This is because ranked queries must efficiently search in ranges of mu, whereas standard queries need to search efficiently in ranges of ratings. Session ID Uniqueness The primary key on bi_session_id in the ranked and standard tables only guarantees uniqueness within that table. We need session ids to be unqiue across an entire title, which spans not only the ranked and standard tables, but also potentially multiple database servers. To address this issue, when creating a session, the front door selects a session id as follows: Randomly select a 64 bit session id If the session id is all zeros in the top 48 bits, then try again until we have a session id that is non-zero in the top 48 bits Set the least significant nibble (0x000F) equal to the database server id this session is being created on. The first server in use by a title is server id 0, the second server in use by a title is session id 1, and so on. We do not support more than 16 servers per title. This ensures that session ids on different servers will never be the same. It also helps the front door locate sessions for FindById queries. Set the 2nd least significant nibble (0x00F0) to the host type as indicated by the client. Note that this also encodes the NAT type. This ensures that session ids for system link games will be different from session ids for matchmaking sessions. Set the 2nd least significant byte (0xFF00) equal to the game type. This ensures that the session ids in the ranked table are different from the session ids in the standard table. The front door then tries to create a session. In rare cases, the front door may have randomly selected a session id that is already in use. In that case, the insert session operation will fail with a primary key violation, and the front door will select a new session id and retry.

Each Filter represents a WHERE condition, that restricts the rows returned. Each SortOperation represents an ORDER BY condition that determines how the results that meet the where clause will be sorted, which determines the order in which the 25 rows are returned, and if there are more than 25 rows that meet the filter criteria, which of those rows will be returned. Each Return adds a column to the select statement, such that the attribute is part of the search results. For each title defined query, three stored procs are generated. One stored proc searches for affiliate sessions given a list of session ids and the usual query parameters, one stored proc searches for standards sessions, and the final stored proc searches for ranked sessions. Affiliates Query The match front door gets a list of potential affiliate session ids from the presence front door, sorts them by affiliate value, and then queries the database to see which of those session ids actually meet the requirements of the title defined query. Each affiliates query has the following structure: ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_match_session_0xFFFF2003_0x00000000_search_affiliates]     @i_max_results                  int OUTPUT    ,@si_required_slots              smallint    ,@i_client_ip                    int    ,@ti_nat_type                    tinyint    ,@ti_server_count                tinyint    ,@i_session_id_count             int    ,@vb_session_ids                 varbinary(8000)    ,@param_0x0000800A               bigint    ,@param_0x0000800B               bigint    ,@param_0x10008101               int    ,@param_0x10008102               int    ,@param_0x10008103               int    ,@param_0x50008104               real    ,@param_0x30008105               float    ,@param_0x30008106               float    ,@param_0x20008107               bigint -- Match Code Generator Version - !!Version=4.0.536.0 -- Xlast (XDK) Version = 2.0.1538.0 -- Xlast Project Version = 1.00.0016.0 BEGIN     SET @i_max_results = 25     DECLARE @bi_session_id bigint     DECLARE @b_session_id binary(8)     DECLARE @i int     SET @i = 0     WHILE (@i < @i_session_id_count)     BEGIN         set @b_session_id = substring(@vb_session_ids, 1+(@i * 8), 8)         set @bi_session_id = convert(bigint, @b_session_id)         SELECT             s.bi_session_id            ,s.b_host_address            ,s.b_key_exchange_key            ,s.i_public_available            ,s.i_private_available            ,s.i_public_current            ,s.i_private_current            ,s.att_0x0000800A            ,s.att_0x0000800B            ,s.att_0x10000001            ,s.att_0x10008101         FROM t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard s WITH (NOLOCK)         WHERE               (s.ti_is_available = 1)               AND (s.att_0x0000800A = @param_0x0000800A)               AND (s.att_0x0000800B = @param_0x0000800B)               AND (s.bi_session_id = @bi_session_id)               AND (s.i_public_available >= @si_required_slots)               AND (s.i_ip_addr = @i_client_ip OR s.ti_nat_type + @ti_nat_type < 5)         set @i = @i + 1     END Things to note: The list of session ids is passed as an array of bytes [varbinary(8000)]. With each id containing 8 bytes, up to 1000 session ids can be passed. If the front door tries to pass more than this, it will get a sql exception. The front door limits its list of positive affiliate sessions to 1000 for this reason, which is still far more than we expect to have in practice. A simple select statement is performed for each session id in the array. The select statement will return a single row if the session with that id is available, in the right game mode, game type, has enough slots available, has a compatible nat type, plus any other title defined filters. The queries are only performed on the standard session table, because affiliates are not used for ranked queries. The select statement returns the row no matter if the session is in the same gamer zone or not. The gamer zone is returned as one of the query columns, and the front door checks each row to decide if it should be added to the list of in-zone or out-of-zone games. This solution is straightforward, easy to code and understand. However, a solution that generates a dynamic sql statement that performs a single select statement with a join to 1000 session ids may have performance advantages. Stress will hopefully tell us if we should try it. Ranked Query The goal of the ranked query is to find, as quickly as possible, the closest ranked sessions that meet all the standard and title defined selection criteria. Each affiliates query has the following structure: ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_match_session_0xFFFF2003_0x00000000_search_ranked]     @i_max_results                  int OUTPUT    ,@si_required_slots              smallint    ,@i_client_ip                    int    ,@ti_nat_type                    tinyint    ,@ti_server_count                tinyint    ,@param_0x0000800A               bigint    ,@param_0x0000800B               bigint    ,@param_0x10008101               int    ,@param_0x10008102               int    ,@param_0x10008103               int    ,@param_0x50008104               real    ,@param_0x30008105               float    ,@param_0x30008106               float    ,@param_0x20008107               bigint -- Match Code Generator Version -

However, in a world where we need to plan for 1e6 concurrent sessions, this naive implementation would quickly crush the sql server into submission as it tries to order by 1e6 rows. Some experimentation with Query Analyzer display of various query plans on a test database with many rows shows that, by far, the most significant thing we can do to improve the performance of the query is to reduce the number of rows that are presented to the order by clause to something reasonable. SQL can order by 1000 rows without much trouble. Therefore the first part of the query tries a series of expanding ranges of mu until it finds a range of mu that returns at least 100 rows. Each of these queries is very efficient, because it makes use of the clustered index on ti_is_available, att_0x0000800A (game type), att_0x0000800B (game mode) and att_0x30008105 (mu). The remaining filter clauses (nat type, required slots, and any title defined filters) can be performed reasonably quickly by SQL server, because all the rows it needs to filter will be in contiguous pages in the database, because we have restricted the search using the clustered index, and we start with a very narrow range and get gradually wider. There is a trade off between finding an excellent mu range and the number of queries we need to find that range. Since we re looking for a result set between 100 and 1000 (a factor of 10 difference), we choose to expand mu by a factor of 5 with each attempt. There is a good chance that a 5 times jump in the mu range could return for more than 1000 rows. To guard against this, each session has a random hash value assigned to it between 0 and 9999. If more than 1000 rows are present in the mu range, a subset of those rows are filtered out by only considering rows within a certain range of hash values. This also protects the server against a title that doesn t use mu properly (i.e. opts out of our skill system) and therefore mu always has the default value of 3. Before the real query is performed, the stored proc performs a select to return to the front door the mu range and hash range the proc has decided on. The front door can then add this to an app log so we can monitor how this query is working in the real world. This may help us to diagnose or fortell performance problems in production. While it is not recommended, the title may add their own sort operations, which will be applied before the draw probability sort. If a title does not wish to use our skill system, that title can leave mu and sigma at their default values (presumably by not reporting win/loss information). This query will then select about 1000 sessions at random from the total population of sessions that pass the filter criteria, and then sort by whatever operation the title specifies. Note that this is not nearly as efficient as when mu is a valid value, since the clustered index restriction is defeated.  If we allowed the title to send up their own mu value instead of ours, and if that title honored the same range of mu between 0 and 6 that ours does, then they could take advantage of the clustered index. This is possible because there is no direct communication between stats and match; match simply believes the mu sent up by the console, both for the host and the searcher. This is not currently possible because the client has no way to set mu explicitly.

@param_0x50008104) ASC     set rowcount 0 The general approach of the standard query is similar to the ranked query. The differences are: instead of using mu to reduce the number of rows we need to sort, the gamer rating is used the process is repeated twice, once to find sessions in the same gamer zone, and once to find session in different gamer zones if enough session were found from the first query to satisfy the front door, the second query is skipped. because the front door may reject some returned sessions as duplicates or because they have negative affiliations, the stored proc calculates the number of rows to return as max_results + # of negative sessions, as passed in the @i_negative_sessions parameter, and uses the  set rowcount  feature to limit the number of rows returned instead of the  select top  syntax the order by clause first returns all the sessions that match both country and language, then sessions that match language only, then sessions that match country only, and finally sessions that match neither country nor language. within each subgroup defined by the country/language sort, title defined sort operations are applied, followed by sorting by how close the host s rating is to the client s rating. Title Defined Query Filters Each Filter element in the xlast file has the following structure:   <Filter left="0x30000006" leftType="Parameter" op="&gt;" right="0x30000006" rightType="Attribute"/> Each Filter element corresponds to a condition in the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement in the query, that restricits (i.e. filters) the rows returned by the query. The basic structure of the condition is: left_side op right_side For example: att_0x30000006 > @param_0x30000006 The left side may only be a schema attribute. The right side may be a type compatible parameter, constant, or context value. Title defined attributes and parameters are always allowed to be NULL. A NULL parameter is considered a wildcard. SQL server, however, does not consider NULL to be a wildcard, but is simply an absence of value. Therefore, to implement the wildcard functionality, the following syntax is used: s.att_0x10000001 == @param_0x10000001 OR @param_0x10000001 IS NULL If the left side of the comparison identifies a context, the the   attribute may only be one of == or !=. If it is a property, then it can be any of ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (note that < and > are escapted as &gt; and &lt; in xml). If the left side of the comparison is an Attribute that is a Property, the right side of the comparison may be a Parameter that is a type compatible Property, or a type compatible Constant. Properties of type Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64 are all considered type compatible with each other, because they can be compared by SQL using the operators identified above. Datetimes Properties are only compatible with Datetime Attributes or Datetime Constants. Constants that can be compared to Property values are defined in the xlast file in the Constants element: <Constants clsid="{9DEE98C4-441C-4103-861B-464DF03B36B1}" nextId="1">  <Constant name="MyConstInt32" id="0x15000000" value="1"/> </Constants> This defines an Constant with id=0x15000000 of type Int32 with a value of 1. Note that, as with properties, the first nibble defines the datatype. The second nibble of a Constant will always be   to identify this id as a Constant. If the left side of the comparison is an Attribute that is a Context, then the right side of the comparison may be a Parameter  that is the same Context, or may be one of the literal ContextValues of that context. A Context is an enumeration which defines the full set of allowed values, which are assigned numerical values by xlast, and result in elements like this: <Context clsid="{7F343825-DBB8-4BC0-ACF2-533263622341}" stringId="25" defaultValue="0" friendlyName="MyContext" id="0x00000002">  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext0" value="0" stringId="26"/>  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext1" value="1" stringId="33"/> </Context> Sort Operations The Sort Operations in the xlast file have the following basic structure: <SortOperations>   <SortOperation id="0x70000007" type="Descending" distanceid="0xFFFFFFFF" ordinal="0"/>   <SortOperation id="0x50000003" type="Near" distanceid="0x52000003" ordinal="1"/>  </SortOperations> The Sort Operations correspond to an Order By clause on the Select statement that implements the query. For example, the Sort Operations above would translate to the following Order By clause on the select statement: ORDER BY att_0x70000007 DESC          ,ABS( att_0x50000003 - @param_0x52000003 ) ASC The id in the SortOperation element identifies the Schema Attribute that to Order By. The sort can be one of four types: Ascending, Descending, Near, Far. Ascending and Descending are straightforward, and result in an Order By condition that looks like this: att_0x50000003 ASC Or this: att_0x50000003 DESC The Near and Far are more complicated. They allow you subtract the value of a parameter from an attribute, and then sort on the difference, either ascending or descending. Near corresponds to an Ascending sort, because the difference will be small when the attribute is   the parameter in value. Far corresponds to a Descending sort, because the difference will be large when the attribute is   from the parameter in value. The distanceid parameter indicates which parameter id to subtract from the attribute id, and may be any type compatible Property Parameter. Context cannot be used in Sort Operations. The sort operations are applied to the Order By clause in ascending order by their ordinal values in the xlast file. The precedence between title defined sort operations and system defined sorts is described in the standard and ranked query descriptions above.

Any difference is a possible backwards compatiblity issue and should be filed as a bug. xmatchhost.srf Create or update a matchmaking session. xmatchhostdelete.srf Delete a matchmaking session. xmatchclient.srf Search for matchmaking sessions Xenon Interfaces The following XRLs are used by Xenon clients to create, update, search for, and delete matchmaking sessions. Their functionality is close to the similarly named Legacy Xbox Interfaces, but some additional features have been added, and some have been removed. Note, the fundamental limits below have not changed:         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_PARAMS                    = 20;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_RESULTS                   = 50;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_TITLE_SCHEMA_ATTRS              = 40;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_ATTRIBUTE_DATA                  = 4096; xmatchhost2.ashx Doesn t allow blob schema attributes (does allow strings) Doesn t allow XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK flag in create All schema attributes are allowed to be null. Allows new Xenon datatypes: contexts, plus properties of types: int64, int32, float32, float64, datetime. If the old X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK is zero, then look in the top nibble for xenon subtype.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK                   = 0x00F00000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER                = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_STRING                 = 0x00100000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_BLOB                   = 0x00200000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL                   = 0x00F00000;         // Xenon supports the extended datatypes below. In order to not change the         // protocol for existing clients, these extended types are all considered         // to be X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER by this class. The front door          // checks these extended bits (which were previously unused)          // to interpret each of the 64 bit chunks of type INTEGER correctly.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_MASK                = 0x70000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_CONTEXT             = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT32              = 0x10000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT64              = 0x20000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT64             = 0x30000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT32             = 0x50000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_DATETIME            = 0x70000000; All extended xenon datatypes look like datatype integer, which means they take 64 bits on the wire. Contexts are interpreted as 64 bit its. Int32, the top 32 bits are ignored Int64 is interpreted as 64 bit integer float32, top 32 bits are ignored, low 32 bits are interpreted as single precision IEEE floating point value. float64, 64 bits intepreted as double precision IEEE floating point value. See database.cs DBLayer.Pack64BitsWithFloat, Pack64BitsWithDouble, Interpret64BitsAsFloat, Interpret64BitsAsDouble datetimes are represented on the wire as FILETIME structures in UTC. See DateTime.ToFileTimeUtc, DateTime.FromFileTimeUtc. Update doesn t allow blob schema attributes. Adds xenon subtypes. xmatchhostdelete2.ashx No changes from Tsunami except XRL name. xmatchclient2.ashx In Xbox 1, only datatype was returned in attribute id. In Xenon, the full attribute id is returned in search results. Insert example for clarity. Any extended xenon datatypes in the schema that are returned, get converted and put on the wire as approprite see above. All parameters are allowed to be null. In Xenon, a parameter is considered null if it was defined as a parameter to the query in the xlast file, but the attribute id was not found in the attribute list on the xrl call. Example: The definition of the query in xlast, specifies that MyContext (id=0x00000002) is a parameter to the query. The list of attributes passed on the wire to xmatchclient2.ashx does not include any attribute marked with id=0x00000002. Therefire, MyContext was not passed to the query, and will be considered NULL. NOTE: until Paul checks in the code generator this will not work! The current code genertor names sql stored proc params by order not id and therefore params on the wire must be passed in the correct order. All parameters sent in the search query must be identified with a full attribute id. In xbox 1 only the datatype was required. [Spec Issue] Unclear right now if params passed on the wire are supposed to include the X_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PARAM bit flag. Paul will figure this out. No string or blob paramaters are allowed. No aggregate queries. No title defined FindById queries. Only the system generated FindById query is supported in Xenon, as query id        X_SSINDEX_GET_SESSION = 0xFFFFFFFF. Internal Interfaces These are only called by the SG or internal tools, therefore no back compat work required. deadxbox.ashx No changes. Same XRL. titlechange.ashx No changes. Same XRL. health.ashx No changes. Same XRL Match SQL Database Match Code Generation Note: This section describes the code generated for M3 matchmaking. This is designed to replicate, in most aspects, the behavior of the Tsunami version of xmltosql, and will eventually describe the code generated for Legacy Xbox titles. This section does not describe the code generated for M4 social matchmaking or skill based ranked matchmaking. Xenon code generator will consume xlast files not xms. Table names suffixes will be in hex, with leading 0x and all leading zeros. For example, for titleid 0x000003e7 (decimal 999), the match sessions table will be named t_match_sessions_0x000003e7 instead of t_match_sessions_999 like it was in Tsunami. Title defined columns (a.k.a schema attributes) within tables will use hex suffixes, with leading 0x and all leading zeros. For example, if property id=0x50000003 (a single precision floating point property) is part of the match schema for titleid 0x000003e7. Table t_match_sessions_0x000003e7 will have a column named att_0x50000003 Stored proc suffixes will use titleid in hex, with leading 0x and all leading zeros. The procedure index will also be in hex with 0x prefix and leading zeros. For example, the 10th stored proc (decimal) for titleid 0x000003e7, will be named p_match_search_0x000003e7_0x0000000A. Title defined stored proc query parameters will use hex suffixes, with 0x prefix and all leading zeros, based on the attribute id of that parameter (i.e. either a context id or property id, as indicated in xlast). For example, if property id=0x50000003 is passed to the 10th stored proc of titleid 0x000003e7, stored proc p_match_search_0x000003e7_10 will have a parameter named param_0x50000003.  Leading zeros will be added to hex strings up to 8 characters (i.e. a 32 bit dword representation). Note: for Legacy Xbox Titles, parameters to stored procs must still be named by order, (e.g. param_1, param_2, param_3) because the legacy titles do not send the complete attribute id in the query, only the data type. Note: In Tsunami, parameters had a type prefix in the name (e.g. bi_param_1)  ve chosen to drop that prefix for Xenon.

Blob ** legacy only VARBINARY(800) byte[] 2 byte length prefix + up to 800 bytes of binary data (no terminator) Create Table One table is created for each title. The table is of the following basic form:     CREATE TABLE dbo.t_match_sessions_0x0000000A (          bi_session_id           bigint                  NOT NULL         ,i_ip_addr               int                     NOT NULL         ,i_sg_ip                 int                     NOT NULL         ,b_box_id                binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,b_host_address          binary(36)              NOT NULL         ,si_zoneID               smallint                NOT NULL         ,si_providerID           smallint                NOT NULL         ,b_key_exchange_key      binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,i_public_available      int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_available     int                     NOT NULL         ,i_public_current        int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_current       int                     NOT NULL         ,dt_session_expiration   datetime                NOT NULL         ,ti_is_available         tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,i_hash                  int                     NOT NULL         ,ti_nat_type             tinyint                 NOT NULL         CONSTRAINT t_match_sessions_0x0000000A_PK  PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED                     (bi_session_id),     ) The table name is t_match_sessions_<titleid>, as shown above, where <titleid> is in hex notation with a leading 0x and leading zeros. All titleids in the match sql database will be in hex notation with leading 0x and leading zeros up to 32 bits. The primary key of the table is on bi_session_id, and will be called t_match_sessions_<titleid>_PK. It is not a clustered key, because we want a different clustered index. Two additional indexes will be created on each table, as shown below:     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX ndx_match_sessions_0x0000000A  on t_match_sessions_0x0000000A (ti_is_available, i_hash)     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ndx_match_sessions_0x0000000A_boxid_NC  on t_match_sessions_0x0000000A (b_box_id) The clustered index of the table is on ti_is_available, i_hash, and will be called ndx_match_sessions_<titleid>, as shown above. A non-clustered index will be created on the table on b_box_id, and will be called ndx_match_sessions_<titleid>_boxid_NC Each attribute specified in the xlast file will result in an additional column in the table. For example, the following excerpt from an xlast file: <Schema clsid="{7134D48F-9957-4515-850B-A7426E51345F}"> <Attribute id="0x0000800A"/> <Attribute id="0x0000800B"/> <Attribute id="0x10000001"/> <Attribute id="0x20000002"/> <Attribute id="0x50000003"/> <Attribute id="0x30000006"/> <Attribute id="0x70000007"/> <Attribute id="0x00000002"/> </Schema> Would result in the following column additions to the table definition above:         ,att_0x0000800A          bigint         ,att_0x0000800B          bigint         ,att_0x10000001          int         ,att_0x20000002          bigint         ,att_0x50000003          real         ,att_0x30000006          float         ,att_0x70000007          datetime         ,att_0x00000002          bigint Note that all title defined attributes are allowed to be null. The data type of the column is determined by the high nibble (0x70000000) of the attribute id. High Nibble Meaning SQL Datatype 0x00000000 Context bigint 0x10000000 Property, Int32 0x20000000 Property, Int64 bigint 0x30000000 Property, Float64 float 0x50000000 Property, Float32 0x70000000 Property, Datetime datetime In order to avoid trying to create tables that already exist, and to grant appropriate permissions, these statements will be executed in the following context: IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.sysobjects WHERE name = 't_match_sessions_0x0000000A' and type = 'u') BEGIN     PRINT '**Note: t_match_sessions_0x0000000A table already exists.

The final suffix is the based on the value of the id="0" attribute in the Query element in the xlast file. Each Query element in the xlast file will have a unique id, and that id becomes the suffix following the titleid, in hex notation. Each Query element gets its own stored proc. Attributes may be specified in the Returns element. Each attribute specified in a Return element is included as column in the select statement. Attributes are named att_<id> where id is in hex notation, with a 0x prefix, with leading zeros out to 32 bits. The Parameters element in the xlast file specifies the title defined parameters that the client may provide to the query. Each title defined parameter to the query defaults to NULL, and is therefore optional. Parameter names are named param_<id> where id is the id of the parameter in the Parameter element, in hex notation, with a 0x prefix, with leading zeros out to 32 bits. However, the value 0x02000000 is bitwise and ed into the parameter id. The nibble identified by the mask 0x0F000000 is used to indicate the use of an attribute. Query parameters will always have the value   in those bits. Schema attributes passed to insert and update procs, stored in the table, and identified in Returns elements have   in those bits, which is why nothing needs to be masked in to generate the att_<id> names. Filters and Sort Oprations are complicated and are therefore discussed below in their own sections. Filters Each Filter element in the xlast file has the following structure:   <Filter left="0x30000006" leftType="Parameter" op="&gt;" right="0x30000006" rightType="Attribute"/> Each Filter element corresponds to a condition in the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement in the query, that restricits (i.e. filters) the rows returned by the query. The basic structure of the condition is: left_side op right_side For example: @param_0x30000006 > att_0x30000006 The rules regarding what is allowed on the left and right side of the comparison, plus the value of the operator are detailed below. The most common case will be the one above, where parameters are being compared to attributes. Note that title defined attributes and parameters are always allowed to be NULL. A NULL parameter is considered a wildcard. SQL server, however, does not consider NULL to be a wildcard, but is simply an absence of value. Therefore, to implement the wildcard functionality, the following case statement is used: CASE  WHEN @param_0x32000006 IS NULL THEN 1  WHEN @param_0x32000006 > att_0x32000006 THEN 1  ELSE 0  This statement results in 1 if the parameter is NULL, or results in 1 if the parameter is not NULL and the specified comparison is true, otherwise the statement results in 0. To use this in a where clause to implement the desired wildcard functionality, the results of the CASE statement above are compared to 1, as follows: ( 1 = CASE WHEN @param_0x32000006 IS NULL THEN 1 WHEN @param_0x32000006 > att_0x30000006 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) The SQL code above is the basic form of each condition added to the where clause for each Filter element in the Query element. The left side of the comparison must be an attribute id that is part of the matchmaking schema, i.e. the id must be identified in an Attribute element that is in the Schema element. The  leftType  attribute may be either  Parameter Attribute . If it is  Parameter , then the left side of the comparison is a parameter to the query (i.e. param_<id>). If it is  Attribute  then the left side of the comparison is the attribute column (i.e. att_<id>). If the left side of the comparison identifies a context, the the   attribute may only be one of == or !=. If it is a property, then it can be any of ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (note that < and > are escapted as &gt; and &lt; in xml). If the left side of the comparison is a Parameter that is a Property, the the right side of the comparision may be an Attribute that is a type compatible Property, or a type compatible Constant. Properties of type Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64 are all considered type compatible with each other, because they can be compared by SQL using the operators identified above. Datetimes Properties are only compatible with Datetime Attributes or Datetime Constants. Constants that can be compared to Property values are defined in the xlast file in the Constants element: <Constants clsid="{9DEE98C4-441C-4103-861B-464DF03B36B1}" nextId="1">  <Constant name="MyConstInt32" id="0x15000000" value="1"/> </Constants> This defines an Constant with id=0x15000000 of type Int32 with a value of 1. Note that, as with properties, the first nibble defines the datatype. The second nibble of a Constant will always be   to identify this id as a Constant. If the left side of the comparison is an Attribute that is a Property, the right side of the comparison may be a Parameter that is a type compatible Property, or a type compatible Constant. When a constant is on the right side of a filter, the SQL code generated for that condition will have the form: (1 = CASE WHEN att_0x10000001 IS NULL THEN 1 WHEN att_0x10000001 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) Note that instead of comparing att_0x10000001 to a parameter, it is compared with the literal constant  If the left side of the comparison is a Parameter that is a Context, then the right side of the comparison may be an Attribute that is the same Context, or may be one of the literal ContextValues of that context. A Context is an enumeration which defines the full set of allowed values, which are assigned numerical values by xlast, and result in elements like this: <Context clsid="{7F343825-DBB8-4BC0-ACF2-533263622341}" stringId="25" defaultValue="0" friendlyName="MyContext" id="0x00000002">  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext0" value="0" stringId="26"/>  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext1" value="1" stringId="33"/> </Context> When a Context Value is used as a constant in a filter, the value of the  right  attribute in the Filter element is used as a literal numeric constant in the where clause of the resulting select statement. For example, the second Filter element in the example xlast excerpt above compares an Attribute of type Context with id 0x00000002 to the literal context value 1, and results in the following SQL code: (1 = CASE WHEN att_0x00000002 IS NULL THEN 1 WHEN att_0x00000002 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) If the right side of the comparison is a Parameter that is a Context, then the right side of the comparison may only be a Attribute that is the same Context. Context values are not allowed, because this would result in a useless where clause that either filters all rows or no rows, depending on the value passed for the parameter. Sort Operations The Sort Operations in the xlast file have the following basic structure: <SortOperations>   <SortOperation id="0x70000007" type="Descending" distanceid="0xFFFFFFFF" ordinal="0"/>   <SortOperation id="0x50000003" type="Near" distanceid="0x52000003" ordinal="1"/>  </SortOperations> The Sort Operations correspond to an Order By clause on the Select statement that implements the query. For example, the Sort Operations above would translate to the following Order By clause on the select statement: ORDER BY att_0x70000007 DESC          ,ABS( att_0x50000003 - @param_0x52000003 ) ASC The id in the SortOperation element identifies the Schema Attribute that to Order By. The sort can be one of four types: Ascending, Descending, Near, Far. Ascending and Descending are straightforward, and result in an Order By condition that looks like this: att_0x50000003 ASC Or this: att_0x50000003 DESC The Near and Far are more complicated. They allow you subtract the value of a parameter from an attribute, and then sort on the difference, either ascending or descending. Near corresponds to an Ascending sort, because the difference will be small when the attribute is   the parameter in value. Far corresponds to a Descending sort, because the difference will be large when the attribute is   from the parameter in value. The distanceid parameter indicates which parameter id to subtract from the attribute id, and may be any type compatible Property Parameter. Context cannot be used in Sort Operations. The sort operations are applied to the Order By clause in ascending order by their ordinal values in the xlast file. LiveMatch.exe LiveMatch.exe is the command line tool that generates matchmaking tables and stored procs for Xenon. The command line usage is: LiveMatch /titleid:<titleid> /dblist:<server1;server2> [/droptable] /titleid:<titleid> - the title id to configure /dblist:<server1;server2> - the list of matchmaking servers that will host this title. These should be ip addresses in dotted quad notation, separated by semicolons, e.g.  1.2.3.4;2.3.4.5  (without the quotes). /droptable: if present, match tables are dropped and then recreated. Otherwise, existing match tables are not dropped Note: xmltosql used to have a /nonat parameter to suppress nat type filtering, which we never use. Therefore LiveMatch does not support it. When invoked, LiveMatch retrieves the xlast xml data from the t_game_config table in npdb for the specified titleid. If no xlast data is found, LiveMatch will exit with an error. Note that LiveMatch does not add or change information in t_game_config in any way   that s a job for another tool (LiveTitle, or titlemgr). The xlast xml data from t_game_config is examined, and tables and stored procs are generated on each of the databases as described in section 3.1. If the xlast xml data contains no matchmaking queries, LiveMatch will output a message to that effect to the console and exit, performing no work. If tables and stored procs were created, LiveMatch then calls the p_match_title_insert stored proc on npdb to insert the database list provided on the command line into the t_match_titles table in NPDB. XMS to Xlast converter We will need one in m4, when we merge the partnernets. Xbox 1 Code Generation The M3 code generator described above generates SQL code based on the output of Tsunami s xmltosql utility. In M4 the move to ranked and social matchmaking will result in very different SQL code for Xenon titles. Therefore livematch must be able to detect xlast files that were generated via the XMS to Xlast converter, and generate the old Xbox 1 style SQL code for those titles. Additionally, the M3 code generator (which will become the Xbox 1 code generator in M4) will need to be enhanced to support these additional Xbox 1 features not described above: non-NULL attributes and parameters summary queries custom title defined FindById queries Proximity For now, the code generator still generates code that uses proximity data. Bug 14052 is tracking the work to decide if we want to continue to use proximity data for Xbox 1 titles, vs retiring it completely. If we retire it completely, the SQL code generated for Xbox 1 titles can be simplified, with a corresponding increase in performance. M4 Social Match Overview Conceptually, social matchmaking queries will be performed in 6 passes. Each pass broadens the social match criteria, such that a greater proportion of available sessions will be returned. Popular titles with many available sessions may only need one or two passes to find an acceptable number of sessions, while less popular titles with fewer available sessions may require 5 or 6 passes to find enough sessions to fulfill the match query.  All 6 passes filter on the following criteria: nat_type, is_available, GAME_MODE, GAME_TYPE, plus any filters specified by the title developer in xlast. Under no circumstances will a session be returned that does not meet these minimum requirements. Here is a description of the sessions which are added to the result set with each pass: Pass 0 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in the same gamer zone Pass 1 Sessions in the same gamer zone, closely matched in skill, closely matched in reputation, using the same language, in the same country, with no negative affiliations Pass 2 Sessions in the same gamer zone, loosely matched in skill, and loosely matched in reputation, using the same language, with no negative affiliations Pass 3 Sessions in the same gamer zone with no negative affiliations Pass 4 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in different gamer zones Pass 5 Sessions that meet only the baseline criteria Each pass adds to the result set. Sessions from Pass 0 are returned at the top of the results list, followed by sessions from Pass 1, then Pass 2, and so on.  Affiliation Value of a Session One of the primary goals of social matchmaking is to increase the likelyhook of placing people in sessions with people they prefer, and therefore decreasing the likelyhood of placing them in sessions with people they would rather not play with. There are five possible types of affiliations between players: Friend: I added a person to my Friends list Prefer: I submitted positive feedback on a person Completed: I have completed a game with a person in the past Avoid: I have submitted negative feedback on a person AvoidMe: A person submitted negative feedbac on me The following statements, based on the affiliations above, are consistent with the concept of social matchmaking: A session with one Friend and several strangers is better than a session with one Prefer and several strangers. A session with one Prefer and several strangers is better than a session with one Completed and several strangers. A session with one Completed and several strangers is better than a session with only strangers A session with one Avoid is worse than a session with only strangers A session with one AvoidMe is worse than a session with only straingers In practice, the matchmaking service must be able to evaluate the relative merit of sessions like this: A session with one Friend, and one Avoid A session with two Prefers and one AvoidMe A session with one Friend, two Prefers, three Completeds, one Avoid, and two AvoidMe Avoid and AvoidMe affiliations are not absolute. It is acceptable to be matched into a session that contains people you are avoiding, or people who are avoiding you, as long as the   outweighs the  The affiliation value of each candidate session that contains affiliates will be calculated using the following formula: session_value = (4 * # of friends) + (2 * # of prefers) + (1 * # of completeds)   (3 * # of avoids)   (3 * # of avoidingYou) Using this equation, a session with one friend and one avoid in it is as positive as a session with one completed player. But it takes two perfered players to outweigh one avoid. This will avoid the situation where we do not return a session to the client that has lots of people you like, and only one you don The coefficients in the equation shown here are a starting point. The coefficients will be configuable via in the following settings in npdb. The values must be integer. Since the absolute value of the session has no meaning, we can use larger coefficients to obtain a more precise balance between the five factors without resorting to floating point calculations. xmatchfd_valueOfFriend xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe Pass 0 The match front door receives social match request from client. It is able to identify it as a social match query because the GAME_TYPE context equals RANKED. The match request includes the gamertag? puid? of the user making the request. Note: in the case where there are multiple players on the xbox, the game is responsible for choosing which puid is used for matchmaking. This is specified via ??? before the match query is made. The match front door requests the affiliates list for the user in the match query from Presence. This list returned from presence is an array of structures that look like this: struct P_QUERY_AFFILIATES_REPLY_DATA_MSG  ULONGLONG qwAffiliateID;  DWORD dwListFlags;  DWORD dwTitleID;  ULONGLONG qwSessionID;  MSGTIME mtDateUpdated;  char szGamerTag[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE]; dwListFlags tells the match front door which list(s) the affiliate is on. Only affilates who are online and in the same title are returned by presence to the match front door. The total affilicates list is currently limited to 1500 entries, so the size of the list returned to the match front door will be no larger than 1500 records, and will usually be much smaller. The front door will create a hashtable of sessions and their values according to the psuedocode below: Create HashTable to store session information foreach entry in affiliates list     if sessionid is not in session list, add it with a value of 0     if affiliate is a friend         add xmatchfd_valueOfFriend to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a perfer         add xmatchfd_valueOfFriend to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a completed         add xmatchfd_valueOfFriend to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an avoid         subtract xmatchfd_valueOfFriend from the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an avoidMe         subtract xmatchfd_valueOfFriend from the sessionid s value convert the hashtable to an array sort the array by session value using QuickSort Using the algorithm above, the front door can calculate the values of all the sessions for all the affiliates online in O(n), convert the hashtable to an array in O(n), and then quicksort that array in O(n lg n) on average, O(n^2) worst case. The front door now queries the match sql database to retrieve all the sessions that: are in the list of affiliate session ids with a value of 0 or greater are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria are in the same gamer zone [Issues: what s the best way to pass a long list of session ids to this query? Should each session id be its own parameter? Should we pass a binary list like we do for deadxbox? We could break it into multiple queries of 10, 50, or 100 sessions, and if we don t have enough session ids to complete the query, we just pass null for those parameters. Is there a convenient way to order these sessions in the query results? pass in the session value for each session then have SQL do the sort? Or should the front door just take the results and assemble the sorted list itself?] The front door now begins to assemble the final results list. The sessions that are returned from the match SQL query are added to the results set, in descending order by session value. If there are enough sessions to satify the client query then no more queries are made. The search results are formatted appropriately for the wire and returned to the client.  The definition of  enough sessions to satisfy the client  depends on two factors. First, the front door will examine the xlast data in t_game_config to determine what the title specified for max_results for this query. Under no circumstances will more than max_results sessions be returned. Second, the front door will read the setting xmatchfd_pass0_threshold from npdb. This will be a floating point value between 0 and 1. If the number of sessions in the result set is greater than or equal to xmatchfd_pass0_threshold * max_results, then the result set is considered to be  enough , and the result set is returned. [Issue: what is our starting value for xmatchfd_pass0_threshold?] For example, if the title specified max_results of 25, and xmatchfd_pass0_threshold is 0.9, then 25 * 0.9 = 22.5 sessions are considered  enough . So if only 22 sessions have been found, the front door will continue to Pass 1, but if 23 sessions have been found, the front door will return those 23 sessions. If the number of sessions is exactly equal to the value of max_results * xmatchfd_pass0_threshold, the number of results is considered to be sufficient, and the result set is returned. Pass 1 If Pass 0 did not generate enough sessions, the front door will issue a second SQL query to locate additional sessions. The Pass 1 SQL query will retrieve all the sessions that: are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria are in the same gamer zone The host and the client are closely matched in skill. More precisely, the probability of a draw between the host and the client, as calculated using the hosts MuSigma values and the clients MuSigma values, is high. (Issue: what is the floating point value for  ) (What are the property ids for Mu and Sigma?) The host and the client are closely matched in reputation. (What is the property id for reputation? What is the range of reputation? What does  loosely matched  mean precisely?) The host and the client indicate they are using the same language. (What is the property id for language?) The host and the client indicate they are in the same country. (What is the property id for country?) Some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they contain affiliates and have a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0). Some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be duplicates of sessions already added to the result set in Pass 0. For this reason, the front door will ask the SQL server for more results than it needs in order to complete the results set. The front door knows at the end of Pass 0 how many slots in the result set have been filled, and how many remain to be filled. The front door also knows how many sessions containing affiliates have session values less than zero. The maximum number of sessions that could possibly be filtered out by the front door is (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions). Therefore the front door asks the SQL query to return, at most (# of open slots) + (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions), which simplifys to (max_results) + (# of negative sessions). Example: Pass 0 generated a session value hashtable containing 100 entries. 75 of those entries had a value of 0 or greater, and 25 had a value of less than 0. Of the 75 sessions with a value of zero or greater, 15 were returned by the Pass 0 SQL query (i.e. they were available, had a compatible nat type, were in the correct gamer zone, were the correct GAME_MODE, and GAME_TYPE, and met any title defined criteria). Therefore, 10 slots remain to be filled. The front door will ask for, at most, (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) = 25 + 25 = 50 results back from the Pass 1 SQL query. Assuming 50 or more sessions exist that meet the Pass 1 criteria, this will be enough to fill the remaining slots, even if but 15 of them are duplicates of the results already in the result set, and 25 of them are filtered out because their affiliation value is negative. 10 sessions would still remain, which added to the 15 sessions from pass 0, equals max_results. If the front door has found enough sessions, they are returned to the client. The sessions found in Pass 0 are returned first, followed by the sessions found in Pass 1. The sessions in the Pass 1 chunk are sorted by draw probability. Similar to Pass 0, the front door decides if it has enough settings by multiplying max_results by the xmatchfd_pass1_threshold setting, and returning the results if the set contains at least that many rows. [Issue: what is our starting value for xmatchfd_pass1_threshold?] [Issue: Should we fold Pass 1, 2, and 3 into one sql stored proc for perf reasons?] Pass 2 If Pass 1 did not generate enough sessions, the front door will issue a third SQL query to locate additional sessions. The Pass 2 SQL query will retrieve all the sessions that: are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria are in the same gamer zone The host and the client are loosely matched in skill. More precisely, the probability of a draw between the host and the client, as calculated using the hosts MuSigma values and the clients MuSigma values, is moderately high. (Issue: what is the floating point value for  moderately high ) (What are the property ids for Mu and Sigma?) The host and the client are loosely matched in reputation. (What is the property id for reputation? What is the range of reputation? What does  loosely matched  mean precisely?) The host and the client indicate they are using the same language. (What is the property id for language?) Similar to Pass 1, some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they contain affiliates and have a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0) or are duplicates of sessions already in the result set. As in Pass 1, the front door will request a maximum of (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) from the SQL server. If the front door has found enough sessions, they are returned to the client. The sessions found in Pass 0 are returned first, followed by the sessions found in Pass 1, followed by the session found in Pass 2. The sessions in the Pass 2 chunk are sorted by draw probability. Similar to Pass 1, the front door decides if it has enough settings by multiplying max_results by the xmatchfd_pass2_threshold setting, and returning the results if the set contains at least that many rows. [Issue: what is our starting value for xmatchfd_pass2_threshold?] Pass 3 If Pass 2 did not generate enough sessions, the front door will issue a fourth SQL query to locate additional sessions. The Pass 3 SQL query will retrieve all the sessions that: are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria are in the same gamer zone Similar to Pass 2, some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they contain affiliates and have a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0) or are duplicates of sessions already in the result set. As in Pass 2, the front door will request a maximum of (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) from the SQL server. If the front door has found enough sessions, they are returned to the client. The sessions found in Pass 0 are returned first, followed by the sessions found in Pass 1, followed by the session found in Pass 2, followed by the sessions found in Pass 3. The sessions in the Pass 3 chunk are sorted by draw probability. Similar to Pass 2, the front door decides if it has enough settings by multiplying max_results by the xmatchfd_pass3_threshold setting, and returning the results if the set contains at least that many rows. [Issue: what is our starting value for xmatchfd_pass3_threshold?] [Issue: Should we fold Pass 1, 2, and 3 into one sql stored proc for perf reasons?] Pass 4 If Pass 3 did not generate enough sessions, we are really getting quite desperate. We ve already dropped just about every criteria from our social match query. The only one left that we can drop is Gamer Zone. In Pass 0, we did a query for sessions with positive affiliations that were in the correct gamer zone. In Pass 4 we repeat that query, but we do not require that the sessions returned are in the same Gamer Zone. Specifically, in Pass 4 the front door issues a fifth query to retrieve all the sessions that: are in the list of affiliate session ids with a value of 0 or greater are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria Any non-duplicate sessions returned are added to the result set. If the front door has found enough sessions, they are returned to the client. The sessions found in Pass 0 are returned first, followed by the sessions found in Pass 1, followed by the session found in Pass 2, followed by the sessions found in Pass 3, followed by the sessions found in Pass 4. The sessions in the Pass 4 chunk are sorted by session affiliate value. Sessions with the same value are returned in an undefined order. Similar to Pass 3, the front door decides if it has enough settings by multiplying max_results by the xmatchfd_pass4_threshold setting, and returning the results if the set contains at least that many rows. [Issue: what is our starting value for xmatchfd_pass4_threshold?] Pass 5 If Pass 4 did not generate enough sessions, the front door will issue a sixth SQL query to locate additional sessions. The Pass 5 SQL query will retrieve all the sessions that: are available to join are of a compatible nat type have GAME_TYPE of STANDARD have GAME_MODE equal to the GAME_MODE parameter in the query (should we allow this to be wildcarded with NULL?) pass any title provided filter criteria Similar to Pass 2, some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they contain affiliates and have a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0) or are duplicates of sessions already in the result set. As in Pass 2, the front door will request a maximum of (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) from the SQL server. If the front door has found enough sessions, they are returned to the client. The sessions found in Pass 0 are returned first, followed by the sessions found in Pass 1, followed by the session found in Pass 2, followed by the sessions found in Pass 3, followed by the session in Pass 4, followed by the sessions in Pass 5. The sessions in the Pass 5 chunk sorted in an undefined order. Pass 5 is the final pass. We have broadened the search for sessions as much as it can be. Any sessions in the result set are returned to the client. MultiServer Issues If a title is spans multiple match SQL servers, the affiliate session queries in Pass 0 and Pass 4 must be performed against all the SQL partitions for that titleid. The non-affiliate session queries in Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3, and Pass 5 will be performed against one SQL server only. Session search queries for a particular title will cycle through the SQL partitions on a round robin basis, as they do today. It should be noted that spanning a title across multiple servers reduced the effectiveness of social matchmaking, because the queries are being performed on a subset of the total sessions available. If all sessions are present on one SQL server, it is possible to return the best sessions to the client, instead of a random subset of the best sessions.

Any difference is a possible backwards compatiblity issue and should be filed as a bug. xmatchhost.srf Create or update a matchmaking session. xmatchhostdelete.srf Delete a matchmaking session. xmatchclient.srf Search for matchmaking sessions Xenon Interfaces The following XRLs are used by Xenon clients to create, update, search for, and delete matchmaking sessions. Their functionality is close to the similarly named Legacy Xbox Interfaces, but some additional features have been added, and some have been removed. Note, the fundamental limits below have not changed:         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_PARAMS                    = 20;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_QUERY_RESULTS                   = 50;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_TITLE_SCHEMA_ATTRS              = 40;         public const uint X_MATCH_MAX_ATTRIBUTE_DATA                  = 4096; Note that new datatypes are now allowed: contexts, plus properties of types: int64, int32, float32, float64, datetime. If the old X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK is zero, then look in the top nibble for extended xenon subtype.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_MASK                   = 0x00F00000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER                = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_STRING                 = 0x00100000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_BLOB                   = 0x00200000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL                   = 0x00F00000;         // Xenon supports the extended datatypes below. In order to not change the         // protocol for existing clients, these extended types are all considered         // to be X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_INTEGER by this class. The front door          // checks these extended bits (which were previously unused)          // to interpret each of the 64 bit chunks of type INTEGER correctly.         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_MASK                = 0x70000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_CONTEXT             = 0x00000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT32              = 0x10000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_UINT64              = 0x20000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT64             = 0x30000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_FLOAT32             = 0x50000000;         public const uint X_ATTRIBUTE_XE_SUBTYPE_DATETIME            = 0x70000000; All extended xenon datatypes look like datatype integer, which means they take 64 bits on the wire. Contexts are interpreted as 64 bit ints. Int32, the top 32 bits are ignored Int64 is interpreted as 64 bit integer float32, top 32 bits are ignored, low 32 bits are interpreted as single precision IEEE floating point value. float64, 64 bits intepreted as double precision IEEE floating point value. Test Note: We should make sure we check that 32 bit integers and floating point values with a 1 in the most significant bit are handled properly. See database.cs DBLayer.Pack64BitsWithFloat, Pack64BitsWithDouble, Interpret64BitsAsFloat, Interpret64BitsAsDouble Datetimes are represented on the wire as FILETIME structures in UTC. See DateTime.ToFileTimeUtc, DateTime.FromFileTimeUtc. Blob attributes and parameters are not allowed by any xenon interface. String attributes and paramaters are not allowed to be passed as search parameters, may not be used in filters or sort operations, but may be passed in session host and session update calls, and may be returned as a schema attribute in search calls. Note that xlast will restrict the use of string attributes to only the host s gamertag, so we avoid the issue of terms of use violations with user entered strings being advertized in match. The order of parameters and attributes on the wire is not significant for Xbox 360 interfaces. All attributes and parameters are completely identified by their id, and therefore can be specified in any order, both in calls from the client to the server, and in search results from the server to the client. The absence of an expected id is interpreted as NULL, which may be allowed, or may be an error, depending on the attribute/parameter and the call being made. If attribute id X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL (0x00F00000) is still valid, but has no effect. If it is passed from the client to the server, it does not generate an error. Similarly, NULL attributes in search results may either be simply omitted by the server, or may be represented with X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL. This attribute id can appear multiple times in one call or search result. While either choice is  allowed , the current implementation returns attributes in search results in the order they appear in xlast, and inserts X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL for any missing attributes. This allows the front door to share more code between the Xbox and Xbox 360 code paths. xmatchhost2.ashx Session Create If the session id passed on the wire is all zeros, except for the bits that encode the session type (0x00000000000000F0), then the call is interpreted as a session create operation. Session create does not allow blob schema attributes, but does does allow strings attributes. If the session type is XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK the call will be fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_FLAGS The following attributes must be passed on the wire for all create calls. If any are missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) The following attribute may be passed, but has no effect. If it is missing, the create session call will still succeed: X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID (0x20008107) If an attribute id is passed that is not part of the title s schema, and is not one of the automatic ids listed above, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID All title defined schema attributes are optional and may be omitted. Session Update If the session id passed on the wire is non zeros, in any bit that is not the session type (0x00000000000000F0), then the call is interpreted as a session update operation. If the session id is not valid, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_SESSION_ID Changing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) in an update is not allowed. This parameter may be passed, but iuf the value has been changed, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM The following attributes may be passed. If they are present, the value in the database is update to reflect the value passed in the call. If they are omitted, then the current value in the database remains unchanged. X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) Any title defined attributes may also be passed. If they are present, the value in the database is update to reflect the value passed in the call. If they are omitted, then the current value in the database remains unchanged. If an attribute id is passed that is not part of the title s schema, and is not one of the automatic ids listed above, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID xmatchhostdelete2.ashx No attributes should be passed to this call. If the session id passed is not valid, or is not present in the database, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_SESSION_ID xmatchclient2.ashx The system FindById search query expects only one parameter: X_ATTRIBUTE_SESSION_ID (0x20008003). If this parameter is missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM. If any other parameters are sent, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID. The system FindById query is query id 0xFFFFFFFF. All non FindById query calls must pass the following parameters. If any are missing, the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_PARAM X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID (0x20008107) Title defined parameters may be omitted without error. If any parameters are passed that are not in the list above, and are not in the list of title defined parameters for that query, then the call will fail with XONLINE_E_MATCH_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ID. Note that parameters to search queries should not specify the X_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PARAM bit flag. This flag s only purpose was to help xbox1 xmltosql figure out if an attribute was being used as a parameter or attribute. Xlast and LiveMatch use a different method. Therefore this flag is not used anywhere for Xbox 360 titles. No string or blob paramaters are allowed in search queries for Xbox 360 titles. No aggregate queries are allowed for Xbox 360 titles. No title defined FindById queries are allowed for Xbox 360 titles. Only the system generated FindById query is supported. Internal Interfaces These are only called by the SG or internal tools, therefore no back compat work required. deadxbox.ashx No changes. Same XRL. titlechange.ashx No changes. Same XRL. health.ashx No changes. Same XRL Ranked Matchmaking Ranked matchmaking is for users who are in a competitive mood, and want to have a competitive game against people who are similar to them in skill, and want the results to be reflected in their public global ranking. The fun in a ranked match comes from the competition, and therefore the goal is to find a session filled with players of similar skill. Ranked matchmaking is used for sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE is 0. Creating a session where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 creates a ranked session. Searching for sessions and passing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 as a parameter searches for ranked sessions. Searching for ranked sessions returns N rows, where N is equal to the Max Results entered in xlast for the query id being used. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 0 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet any title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast The results are ordered by the probability of a draw occuring between the user identified as the host of the session and the user identified as searching for the session, based on the host s skill   EMBED Equation.3    and the searcher s skill   EMBED Equation.3   , according to the following calculation:  EMBED Equation.3   The host s skill is passed to the match server in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA attributes in the create session call, and may be updated in the update session call. The searcher s skill is passed to the match server in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA attributes in the search query itself. The parameter  EMBED Equation.3   is fixed at 0.5 for the Xbox Live service, which means   EMBED Equation.3   reduces to 0.5, and the calcuation above reduces to:  EMBED Equation.3   Introduction to the MuSigma Ranking System  and  Notes on the MuSigma Matchmaking  papers for more information on how the skill ranking system works. If more than 1000 sessions meet the search criteria described above, the match server reduces the number of sessions it needs to sort by only considering sessions where   EMBED Equation.3    is within a certain range. The server tries the following ranges, until more than 100 sessions are available to sort. The range is centered around  EMBED Equation.3   , unless that would extend beyond the allowed values of   EMBED Equation.3    which is [0, 6] inclusive, which case the range will start at 0 or end at 6. The ranges attempted are, in order:  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.00096  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.0048  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.024  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.12  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.6  EMBED Equation.3   = 3.0 The logic for this progression is we are looking for a number of sessions between 100 and 1000 which is a factor of 10 difference. Choosing to increase the range by a factor of 5 on each attempt is a good balance between find a range that will produce the number of sessions we re looking for, and not making too many attempts.  The final value attempted is 3, which includes the entire range [0,6], and therefore does not filter any sessions out. The initial value attempted is 0.00096, which creates a range of mu that is 0.00032 of the total range of 0 to 6. If there were 1e6 sessions in the database that meet the criteria described above, and if the distribution of mu for those sessions was even between 0 and 6, this would reduce the list of 1e6 sessions to 320. Even if the distribution of mu is not even (which it won t be) this initial value should reduce the number of sessions under consideration to a reasonable number. Over the life of Xbox 360, we do not expect any single title to have more than 1e6 available session of the same game type and game mode, therefore this initial value is small enough. If the range of mu selected by the previous algorithm does not reduce the set of sessions to 1000 or less, the server will further restrict the number of sessions that will be sorted by randomly discarding a percentage of the sessions such that approximately 1000 sessions will be considered. Title defined sort operations are supported, and will be applied prior to the draw probability sort described above. This is not recommended, because if there are more than one or two possible values for the title defined sort criteria, the draw probability sort will have almost no effect on the ordering of the sessions, and therefore almost no effect on which 25 of the up to 1000 sessions will be returned. Also note that if mu is not valid for a particular title (likely because that developer has chosen to implement their own concept of skill and disabled ours), then the process of choosing a mu range will have no effect, and the 1000 candidate sessions presented to the sort operation will be a random selection of available sessions. This will also hurt performance, because the random selection is not as efficient as the mu range selection, because it does not make use of the clustered index on the table. Standard (Casual? Social?) Matchmaking Standard Matchmaking is for users who are in a mood where winning and losing is less important than finding a session filled with people they enjoy playing with. The following factors are used in an attempt to find a session populated by compatible people. Who is on the user s friends list? Who has the user submitted positive feedback on? Who has the user completed games with in the past? Who has the user submitted negative feedback on? Who has submitted negative feedback on the user? What gamer zone did the user select? What gamer zone did the host select? What is the user s gamer rating? What is the host s gamer rating? What country did the user select? What country did the host select? What language did the user select? What language did the host select?  Standard matchmaking is used for sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE is 1. Creating a session where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 creates a standard session. Searching for sessions and passing X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 as a parameter searches for standard sessions. Searching for standard sessions returns N rows, where N is equal to the Max Results entered in xlast for the query id being used. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet any title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast Conceptually, a standard matchmaking query can be thought of as a series of queries, each one slightly broader that the previous query, until enough results have been collected. Each query pass is described below: Pass 0 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in the same gamer zone Pass 1 Sessions with no negative affiliations (e.g. avoided players), in the same gamer zone Pass 2 Sessions with positive affiliations (e.g. friends), in a different gamer zone Pass 3 Sessions with no negative affiliations (e.g. avoided players), in a different gamer zone Each pass adds to the result set. Sessions from Pass 0 are returned at the top of the results list, followed by sessions from Pass 1, then Pass 2, then Pass 3. Affiliation Value of a Session One of the primary goals of standard matchmaking is to increase the probability of placing people in sessions with people they prefer, and decrease the probability of placing them in sessions with people they would rather not play with. There are five types of affiliations between players that standard matchmaking takes into consideration: Friend: I added a person to my Friends list Positive Feedback: I submitted positive feedback on a person Completed Game: I have completed a game with a person in the past Negative Feedback: I have submitted negative feedback on a person Avoiding Me: A person submitted negative feedback on me The following statements, based on the affiliations above, are consistent with the concept of standard matchmaking: A session with one Friend and several strangers is better than a session with one Positive Feedback and several strangers. A session with one Positive Feedback and several strangers is better than a session with one Completed Game and several strangers. A session with one Completed Game and several strangers is better than a session with only strangers A session with one Negative Feedback is worse than a session with only strangers A session with one Avoiding Me is worse than a session with only straingers In practice, the matchmaking service must be able to evaluate the relative merit of sessions like this: A session with one Friend, and one Negative Feedback A session with two Positive Feedback and one Negative Feedback A session with one Friend, two Postivie Feedback, three Completed Game, one Negative Feedback, and two Avoiding Me Negative Feedback and Avoiding Me affiliations are not absolute. It is acceptable to be matched into a session that contains people you submitted negative feedback on, or people who submitted negative feedback on you, as long as the   outweighs the  The affiliation value of each session that contains affiliates will be calculated using the following formula: session_value = (4 * # of Friends) + (2 * # of Positive Feedback) + (1 * # of Completed Game)   (3 * # of Negative Feedback)   (3 * # of Avoiding Me) Using this equation, a session with one Friend and one Negative Feedback is as positive as a session with one Completed Game player. But it takes two Positive Feedback players to outweigh one Negative Feedback. This will avoid the situation where matchmaking does not offer you a session that has lots of people you like, and only one you don The coefficients in the equation shown here are a starting point. The coefficients will be configuable via in the following settings in npdb. The values must be integer. Since the absolute value of the session has no meaning, we can use larger coefficients to obtain a more precise balance between the five factors without resorting to floating point calculations. xmatchfd_valueOfFriend (initial value 4) xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer (initial value 2) xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted (initial value 1) xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid (initial value -3) xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe (initial value -3) Note that it is possible for user A to be affiliated with user B in more than one way. For example, the first time you complete a game with someone, they will be added as a Completed Game affiliate. If you then submit positive feedback on them, they will be both a Completed Game and a Positive Feedback affiliate. If you then add them as a friend, they will be a Completed Game, Positive Feedback, and Friend affiliate. Note however that Completed Game and Positive Feedback are finite lists. Eventually, an active player could fill their lists, and the Completed Game and Positive Feedback affiliations will disappear. There is one exception to this rule. It is not possible to be both a Positive Feedback and Negative Feedback affiliate of the same user. The presence service removes any Negative Feedback affiliation if you submit Positive Feedback, and vice versa. If a user has multiple affiliations, then each of those affiliations is considered independantly for the purposes of calculating the affiliate value of a session. For example, using the initial values above, a user who is both a Completed Game and Positive Feedback affiliate would contribute +3 to the affiliate value of a session, exactly the same as one Completed Game affiliate and one Positive Feedback affiliate. Pass 0 Pass 0 returns search results with a positive affiliation value in the same gamer zone. The match front door requests the affiliates list from Presence for the user puid passed in the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_PUID parameter to the match query. The list returned from presence is an array of structures that look like this: struct P_QUERY_AFFILIATES_REPLY_DATA_MSG  ULONGLONG qwAffiliateID;  DWORD dwListFlags;  DWORD dwTitleID;  ULONGLONG qwSessionID;  MSGTIME mtDateUpdated;  char szGamerTag[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE]; dwListFlags tells the match front door which list(s) the affiliate is on. Only affilates who are online and in the same title are returned by presence to the match front door. The total affilicates list is currently limited to 1500 entries, so the size of the list returned to the match front door will be no larger than 1500 records, and will usually be much smaller. The front door will create a hashtable of sessions and their values according to the psuedocode below: Create HashTable to store session information foreach entry in affiliates list     if sessionid is not in session list, add it with a value of 0     if affiliate is a friend         add xmatchfd_valueOfFriend to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a positive feedback         add xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is a completed game         add xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted to the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an negative feedback         add xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid from the sessionid s value     if affiliate is an avoiding me         add xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe from the sessionid s value convert the hashtable to an array sort the array by session value using QuickSort Using the algorithm above, the front door can calculate the values of all the sessions for all the affiliates online in O(n), convert the hashtable to an array in O(n), and then quicksort that array in O(n lg n) on average, O(n^2) worst case. The front door now queries all match sql databases configured for the title to retrieve all the sessions that: are in the list of affiliate session ids with a value of 0 or greater have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE equal to 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE equal to the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE parameter in the query have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE equal to the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE parameter in the query have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet all title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast The results are ordered by the affiliate value of the session, in decreasing order (i.e. large affiliate values first). If the number of results is equal to or greater than max results specified for this query in the xlast file, then these sessions are returned without further processing. Pass 1 Pass 0 returns session with no affiliations, in the same gamer zone. If more than the required number of sessions are available, the query considers the gamer rating, country, and language of the host and the client when deciding which rows to return to the client. All rows returned will: have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE = 1 have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE passed as a parameter have X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE that matches the X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE passed as a parameter have enough public slots open for the number of players signed in on the console (at the time the query was made   this may of course change by the time the console attempts to join the session) are being hosted by a console with a NAT that is compatible with the NAT in use by the console sending the query meet all title defined filter critera provided for the query in xlast If more than 1000 sessions meet the search criteria described above, the match server reduces the number of sessions it needs to sort by only considering sessions where the host s X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING is within a certain range. The server tries the following ranges, until more than 100 sessions are available to sort. The range is centered around the client s X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING unless that would extend beyond the allowed values of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING which is [0, 100] inclusive, which case the range will start at 0 and/or end at 100. The ranges attempted are, in order:  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.016  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.08  EMBED Equation.3   = 0.4  EMBED Equation.3   = 2.0  EMBED Equation.3   = 10.0  EMBED Equation.3   = 50.0 The logic for this progression is we are looking for a number of sessions between 100 and 1000 which is a factor of 10 difference. Choosing to increase the range by a factor of 5 on each attempt is a good balance between find a range that will produce the number of sessions we re looking for, and not making too many attempts.  The final value attempted is 50, which includes the entire range [0,100], and therefore does not filter any sessions out. The initial value attempted is 0.016, which creates a range of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING that is 0.00032 of the total range of 0 to 100. If there were 1e6 sessions in the database that meet the criteria described above, and if the distribution of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING for those sessions was even between 0 and 100, this would reduce the list of 1e6 sessions to 320. Even if the distribution of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING is not even (which it won t be) this initial value should reduce the number of sessions under consideration to a reasonable number. Over the life of Xbox 360, we do not expect any single title to have more than 1e6 available session of the same game type and game mode, therefore this initial value is small enough. If the range of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING selected by the previous algorithm does not reduce the set of sessions to 1000 or less, the server will further restrict the number of sessions that will be sorted by randomly discarding a percentage of the sessions such that approximately 1000 sessions will be considered. Once a range of X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING has been selected, the rows that pass all the filters, including the range check, will be sorted as follows. Sessions where X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE and X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY are equal to the client values are returned first. Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE is equal to the client values are returned next. Sessions where only X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY is equal to the client values are returned next. Sessions where neither X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE nor X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY are equal to the client values are returned last. Within each of the groupings defined above, title defined sort operations will then be applied. Within each of the groupings created by the title defined sort operations, rows will be ordered by how closely the host s X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING matches the client value, in ascending order (i.e. closer matches will be returned first). Note that some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door will be rejected by the front door because they are actually affiliate sessions with a negative session value (as calculated in pass 0). Some of the sessions returned by the match SQL server to the front door may also be affiliate sessions with a positive affiliate value, in which case they will be duplicates of sessions already added to the result set in Pass 0. For this reason, the front door will ask the SQL server for more results than it needs in order to complete the results set. The front door knows at the end of Pass 0 how many slots in the result set have been filled, and how many remain to be filled. The front door also knows how many negative affiliate sessions there are. The maximum number of sessions that could possibly be filtered out by the front door is (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions). Therefore the front door asks the SQL query to return, at most (# of open slots) + (# of filled slots) + (# of negative sessions), which simplifys to (max_results) + (# of negative sessions). Example: Pass 0 generated a session value hashtable containing 100 entries. 75 of those entries had a value of 0 or greater, and 25 had a value of less than 0. Of the 75 sessions with a value of zero or greater, 15 were returned by the Pass 0 SQL query (i.e. they were available, had a compatible nat type, were in the correct gamer zone, were the correct GAME_MODE, and GAME_TYPE, and met any title defined criteria). Therefore, 10 slots remain to be filled. The front door needs, at most, (max_results) + (# of negative sessions) = 25 + 25 = 50 results back from the Pass 1 SQL query. Assuming 50 or more sessions exist that meet the Pass 1 criteria, this will be enough to fill the remaining slots, even if 15 of them are duplicates of the results already in the result set, and 25 of them are filtered out because their affiliation value is negative. 10 sessions would still remain, which added to the 15 sessions from pass 0, equals max_results. In practice, the sql query already knows max_results, so the front door simply supplies the stored proc with the number of negative affiliate sessions. Pass 2 Pass 2 requeries the match sql database to find all positive affiliate sessions that are in a different gamer zone than the client. The affiliate values do not need to be recalculated. The results of Pass 2 are ordered by the affiliate value of each session in descending order (i.e. larger values first). Because Pass 0 and Pass 2 act on exactly the same information, to avoid an extra database round trip, the queries for Pass 0 and Pass 2 are combined into one  affiliates  query to the database. If the results from Pass 2 are not required because Pass 0 and Pass 1 have generated enough results, they are simply discarded by the front door. Pass 3 If Pass 3 is idential to Pass 1, except that it returns sessions that are in a different gamer zone.  Because Pass 1 and Pass 3 act on exactly the same information, to avoid an extra database round trip , they queries for Pass 1 and Pass 3 are combined into one query to the database. However, because the query knows how many results the front door is looking for (max_results + # of negative sessions), the stored proc is able to exit after performing the work for Pass 1 if it knows there will be enough results just from Pass 1 alone to satisfy the front door. MultiServer Issues If a title is spans multiple match SQL servers, the affiliate session queries in Pass 0 and Pass 2 must be performed against all the SQL partitions for that titleid. The non-affiliate session queries in Pass 1 and Pass 3 will be performed against one SQL server only. The Pass 1 and Pass 3 search queries for a particular title will cycle through the SQL partitions on a round robin basis. It should be noted that spanning a title across multiple servers reduces the effectiveness of matchmaking, because the queries are being performed on a subset of the total sessions available. If all sessions are present on one SQL server, it is possible to return the best sessions to the client, instead of a random subset of the best sessions. Match Database Design Datatypes The following table shows how xlast datatypes are mapped to T-SQL, C#, and wiredata representations. Xlast Type Name T-SQL Data Type C# type Wiredata DateTime (8 bytes) DATETIME DateTime 64 bit unsigned long integer Float (4 bytes) float 64 bit unsigned long integer Integer (4 bytes) 64 bit unsinged long integer Long Float (8 bytes) FLOAT double 64 bit unsinged long integer Long Integer (8 bytes) BIGINT 64 bit unsinged long integer String ** supported only for gamer tag NVARCHAR(400) string 2 byte length prefix + up to 400 bytes of UTF8 encoded character data (not 400 character, 400 bytes) plus 1 byte null terminator. Blob ** not allowed for xbox 360 titles VARBINARY(800) byte[] 2 byte length prefix + up to 800 bytes of binary data (no terminator) Session Tables Each title will have two session tables; one for ranked matches and one for standard matches. We choose to separate the sessions into two tables because the clustered index required for ranked queries to perform well is different from the clustered index required for standard matches to perform well. The definition of the standard table looks like this:     CREATE TABLE dbo.t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          bi_session_id           bigint                  NOT NULL         ,i_ip_addr               int                     NOT NULL         ,i_sg_ip                 int                     NOT NULL         ,b_box_id                binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,b_host_address          binary(36)              NOT NULL         ,b_key_exchange_key      binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,i_public_available      int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_available     int                     NOT NULL         ,i_public_current        int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_current       int                     NOT NULL         ,dt_session_expiration   datetime                NOT NULL         ,ti_is_available         tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,i_hash                  int                     NOT NULL         ,ti_nat_type             tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800A          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800B          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008101          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008102          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008103          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x50008104          real NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008105          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008106          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x10000001          int         CONSTRAINT t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_pk PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED                     (bi_session_id),     )     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_ndx on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          ti_is_available         ,att_0x0000800A         ,att_0x0000800B         ,att_0x50008104         ,bi_session_id     )     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard_ndx_boxid_nc on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard (          b_box_id     )          There are a number of universal columns with descriptive names, followed by a number of universal columns named for the attributes ids: X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_TYPE (0x0000800A) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAME_MODE (0x0000800B) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_ZONE (0x10008101) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_COUNTRY (0x10008102) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_LANGUAGE (0x10008103) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_RATING (0x50008104) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_MU (0x30008105) X_ATTRIBUTE_GAMER_SIGMA (0x30008106) All of these are defined as NOT NULL. Following these universal columns are the title defined columns. Note that the title may provide game type and game mode in xlast. If they do, those attributes will not be duplicated, but instead will simply be ignored in favor of the built in definitions above. The primary key is bi_session_id, and is non-clustered. This non-clustered index will provide reasonably efficient bookmark lookups for FindById queries and affiliate session lookups. There is another non clustered index on b_box_id. This is used to delete sessions in a reasonably efficient manner when processing Dead SG and Dead Xbox messages. The clustered index is on ti_is_available, game type, game mode, gamer rating, and session id. Any single query will always be restricted to sessions that are available, in particular game type and game mode. Putting these three columns at the beginning of the clustered index ensures that the sessions that will be considered by any one search query are on contiguous pages in the database. (Of course, in the standard table, the game type will always be 1, but we leave the column in for clarity.) Gamer rating is part of the clustered index so we can efficiently determine what range of ratings should be used to generate between 100 and 1000 rows to present to the order by clause in a query. The session id is added to the end of the clustered index to guarantee uniqueness. If we didn t do this, SQL server would add an internal hidden column containing a guid to guanratee uniqueness, which would be less efficient than simply using session id. The definition of the ranked table is almost identical:     CREATE TABLE dbo.t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          bi_session_id           bigint                  NOT NULL         ,i_ip_addr               int                     NOT NULL         ,i_sg_ip                 int                     NOT NULL         ,b_box_id                binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,b_host_address          binary(36)              NOT NULL         ,b_key_exchange_key      binary(16)              NOT NULL         ,i_public_available      int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_available     int                     NOT NULL         ,i_public_current        int                     NOT NULL         ,i_private_current       int                     NOT NULL         ,dt_session_expiration   datetime                NOT NULL         ,ti_is_available         tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,i_hash                  int                     NOT NULL         ,ti_nat_type             tinyint                 NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800A          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x0000800B          bigint NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008101          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008102          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x10008103          int NOT NULL         ,att_0x50008104          real NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008105          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x30008106          float NOT NULL         ,att_0x10000001          int         CONSTRAINT t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_pk PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED                     (bi_session_id),     )     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_ndx on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          ti_is_available         ,att_0x0000800A         ,att_0x0000800B         ,att_0x30008105         ,bi_session_id     )     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked_ndx_boxid_nc on t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_ranked (          b_box_id     ) Other than the table and index names the only significant difference is the clustered index. Instead of gamer rating, the clustered index includes gamer mu. This is because ranked queries must efficiently search in ranges of mu, whereas standard queries need to search efficiently in ranges of ratings. Session ID Uniqueness The primary key on bi_session_id in the ranked and standard tables only guarantees uniqueness within that table. We need session ids to be unqiue across an entire title, which spans not only the ranked and standard tables, but also potentially multiple database servers. To address this issue, when creating a session, the front door selects a session id as follows: Randomly select a 64 bit session id If the session id is all zeros in the top 48 bits, then try again until we have a session id that is non-zero in the top 48 bits Set the least significant nibble (0x000F) equal to the database server id this session is being created on. The first server in use by a title is server id 0, the second server in use by a title is session id 1, and so on. We do not support more than 16 servers per title. This ensures that session ids on different servers will never be the same. It also helps the front door locate sessions for FindById queries. Set the 2nd least significant nibble (0x00F0) to the host type as indicated by the client. Note that this also encodes the NAT type. This ensures that session ids for system link games will be different from session ids for matchmaking sessions. Set the 2nd least significant byte (0xFF00) equal to the game type. This ensures that the session ids in the ranked table are different from the session ids in the standard table. The front door then tries to create a session. In rare cases, the front door may have randomly selected a session id that is already in use. In that case, the insert session operation will fail with a primary key violation, and the front door will select a new session id and retry. The front door will retry up to 3 times before giving up and returning an error to the client.

Each Filter represents a WHERE condition, that restricts the rows returned. Each SortOperation represents an ORDER BY condition that determines how the results that meet the where clause will be sorted, which determines the order in which the 25 rows are returned, and if there are more than 25 rows that meet the filter criteria, which of those rows will be returned. Each Return adds a column to the select statement, such that the attribute is part of the search results. For each title defined query, three stored procs are generated. One stored proc searches for affiliate sessions given a list of session ids and the usual query parameters, one stored proc searches for standards sessions, and the final stored proc searches for ranked sessions. Affiliates Query The match front door gets a list of potential affiliate session ids from the presence front door, sorts them by affiliate value, and then queries the database to see which of those session ids actually meet the requirements of the title defined query. Each affiliates query has the following structure: ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_match_session_0xFFFF2003_0x00000000_search_affiliates]     @i_max_results                  int OUTPUT    ,@si_required_slots              smallint    ,@i_client_ip                    int    ,@ti_nat_type                    tinyint    ,@ti_server_count                tinyint    ,@i_session_id_count             int    ,@vb_session_ids                 varbinary(8000)    ,@param_0x0000800A               bigint    ,@param_0x0000800B               bigint    ,@param_0x10008101               int    ,@param_0x10008102               int    ,@param_0x10008103               int    ,@param_0x50008104               real    ,@param_0x30008105               float    ,@param_0x30008106               float    ,@param_0x20008107               bigint -- Match Code Generator Version - !!Version=4.0.536.0 -- Xlast (XDK) Version = 2.0.1538.0 -- Xlast Project Version = 1.00.0016.0 BEGIN     SET @i_max_results = 25     DECLARE @bi_session_id bigint     DECLARE @b_session_id binary(8)     DECLARE @i int     SET @i = 0     WHILE (@i < @i_session_id_count)     BEGIN         set @b_session_id = substring(@vb_session_ids, 1+(@i * 8), 8)         set @bi_session_id = convert(bigint, @b_session_id)         SELECT             s.bi_session_id            ,s.b_host_address            ,s.b_key_exchange_key            ,s.i_public_available            ,s.i_private_available            ,s.i_public_current            ,s.i_private_current            ,s.att_0x0000800A            ,s.att_0x0000800B            ,s.att_0x10000001            ,s.att_0x10008101         FROM t_match_sessions_0xFFFF2003_standard s WITH (NOLOCK)         WHERE               (s.ti_is_available = 1)               AND (s.att_0x0000800A = @param_0x0000800A)               AND (s.att_0x0000800B = @param_0x0000800B)               AND (s.bi_session_id = @bi_session_id)               AND (s.i_public_available >= @si_required_slots)               AND (s.i_ip_addr = @i_client_ip OR s.ti_nat_type + @ti_nat_type < 5)         set @i = @i + 1     END Things to note: The list of session ids is passed as an array of bytes [varbinary(8000)]. With each id containing 8 bytes, up to 1000 session ids can be passed. If the front door tries to pass more than this, it will get a sql exception. The front door limits its list of positive affiliate sessions to 1000 for this reason, which is still far more than we expect to have in practice. A simple select statement is performed for each session id in the array. The select statement will return a single row if the session with that id is available, in the right game mode, game type, has enough slots available, has a compatible nat type, plus any other title defined filters. The queries are only performed on the standard session table, because affiliates are not used for ranked queries. The select statement returns the row no matter if the session is in the same gamer zone or not. The gamer zone is returned as one of the query columns, and the front door checks each row to decide if it should be added to the list of in-zone or out-of-zone games. This solution is straightforward, easy to code and understand. However, a solution that generates a dynamic sql statement that performs a single select statement with a join to 1000 session ids may have performance advantages. Stress will hopefully tell us if we should try it. Ranked Query The goal of the ranked query is to find, as quickly as possible, the closest ranked sessions that meet all the standard and title defined selection criteria. Each affiliates query has the following structure: ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_match_session_0xFFFF2003_0x00000000_search_ranked]     @i_max_results                  int OUTPUT    ,@si_required_slots              smallint    ,@i_client_ip                    int    ,@ti_nat_type                    tinyint    ,@ti_server_count                tinyint    ,@param_0x0000800A               bigint    ,@param_0x0000800B               bigint    ,@param_0x10008101               int    ,@param_0x10008102               int    ,@param_0x10008103               int    ,@param_0x50008104               real    ,@param_0x30008105               float    ,@param_0x30008106               float    ,@param_0x20008107               bigint -- Match Code Generator Version -

However, in a world where we need to plan for 1e6 concurrent sessions, this naive implementation would quickly crush the sql server into submission as it tries to order by 1e6 rows. Some experimentation with Query Analyzer display of various query plans on a test database with many rows shows that, by far, the most significant thing we can do to improve the performance of the query is to reduce the number of rows that are presented to the order by clause to something reasonable. SQL can order by 1000 rows without much trouble. Therefore the first part of the query tries a series of expanding ranges of mu until it finds a range of mu that returns at least 100 rows. Each of these queries is very efficient, because it makes use of the clustered index on ti_is_available, att_0x0000800A (game type), att_0x0000800B (game mode) and att_0x30008105 (mu). The remaining filter clauses (nat type, required slots, and any title defined filters) can be performed reasonably quickly by SQL server, because all the rows it needs to filter will be in contiguous pages in the database, because we have restricted the search using the clustered index, and we start with a very narrow range and get gradually wider. There is a trade off between finding an excellent mu range and the number of queries we need to find that range. Since we re looking for a result set between 100 and 1000 (a factor of 10 difference), we choose to expand mu by a factor of 5 with each attempt. There is a good chance that a 5 times jump in the mu range could return for more than 1000 rows. To guard against this, each session has a random hash value assigned to it between 0 and 9999. If more than 1000 rows are present in the mu range, a subset of those rows are filtered out by only considering rows within a certain range of hash values. This also protects the server against a title that doesn t use mu properly (i.e. opts out of our skill system) and therefore mu always has the default value of 3. Before the real query is performed, the stored proc performs a select to return to the front door the mu range and hash range the proc has decided on. The front door can then add this to an app log so we can monitor how this query is working in the real world. This may help us to diagnose or fortell performance problems in production. While it is not recommended, the title may add their own sort operations, which will be applied before the draw probability sort. If a title does not wish to use our skill system, that title can leave mu and sigma at their default values (presumably by not reporting win/loss information). This query will then select about 1000 sessions at random from the total population of sessions that pass the filter criteria, and then sort by whatever operation the title specifies. Note that this is not nearly as efficient as when mu is a valid value, since the clustered index restriction is defeated.  If we allowed the title to send up their own mu value instead of ours, and if that title honored the same range of mu between 0 and 6 that ours does, then they could take advantage of the clustered index. This is possible because there is no direct communication between stats and match; match simply believes the mu sent up by the console, both for the host and the searcher. This is not currently possible because the client has no way to set mu explicitly.

@param_0x50008104) ASC     set rowcount 0 The general approach of the standard query is similar to the ranked query. The differences are: instead of using mu to reduce the number of rows we need to sort, the gamer rating is used the process is repeated twice, once to find sessions in the same gamer zone, and once to find session in different gamer zones if enough session were found from the first query to satisfy the front door, the second query is skipped. because the front door may reject some returned sessions as duplicates or because they have negative affiliations, the stored proc calculates the number of rows to return as max_results + # of negative sessions, as passed in the @i_negative_sessions parameter, and uses the  set rowcount  feature to limit the number of rows returned instead of the  select top  syntax the order by clause first returns all the sessions that match both country and language, then sessions that match language only, then sessions that match country only, and finally sessions that match neither country nor language. within each subgroup defined by the country/language sort, title defined sort operations are applied, followed by sorting by how close the host s rating is to the client s rating. Title Defined Query Filters Each Filter element in the xlast file has the following structure:   <Filter left="0x30000006" leftType="Parameter" op="&gt;" right="0x30000006" rightType="Attribute"/> Each Filter element corresponds to a condition in the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement in the query, that restricits (i.e. filters) the rows returned by the query. The basic structure of the condition is: left_side op right_side For example: att_0x30000006 > @param_0x30000006 The left side may only be a schema attribute. The right side may be a type compatible parameter, constant, or context value. Title defined attributes and parameters are always allowed to be NULL. A NULL parameter is considered a wildcard. SQL server, however, does not consider NULL to be a wildcard, but is simply an absence of value. Therefore, to implement the wildcard functionality, the following syntax is used: s.att_0x10000001 == @param_0x10000001 OR @param_0x10000001 IS NULL If the left side of the comparison identifies a context, the the   attribute may only be one of == or !=. If it is a property, then it can be any of ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (note that < and > are escapted as &gt; and &lt; in xml). If the left side of the comparison is an Attribute that is a Property, the right side of the comparison may be a Parameter that is a type compatible Property, or a type compatible Constant. Properties of type Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64 are all considered type compatible with each other, because they can be compared by SQL using the operators identified above. Datetimes Properties are only compatible with Datetime Attributes or Datetime Constants. Constants that can be compared to Property values are defined in the xlast file in the Constants element: <Constants clsid="{9DEE98C4-441C-4103-861B-464DF03B36B1}" nextId="1">  <Constant name="MyConstInt32" id="0x15000000" value="1"/> </Constants> This defines an Constant with id=0x15000000 of type Int32 with a value of 1. Note that, as with properties, the first nibble defines the datatype. The second nibble of a Constant will always be   to identify this id as a Constant. If the left side of the comparison is an Attribute that is a Context, then the right side of the comparison may be a Parameter  that is the same Context, or may be one of the literal ContextValues of that context. A Context is an enumeration which defines the full set of allowed values, which are assigned numerical values by xlast, and result in elements like this: <Context clsid="{7F343825-DBB8-4BC0-ACF2-533263622341}" stringId="25" defaultValue="0" friendlyName="MyContext" id="0x00000002">  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext0" value="0" stringId="26"/>  <ContextValue friendlyName="MyContext1" value="1" stringId="33"/> </Context> Sort Operations The Sort Operations in the xlast file have the following basic structure: <SortOperations>   <SortOperation id="0x70000007" type="Descending" distanceid="0xFFFFFFFF" ordinal="0"/>   <SortOperation id="0x50000003" type="Near" distanceid="0x52000003" ordinal="1"/>  </SortOperations> The Sort Operations correspond to an Order By clause on the Select statement that implements the query. For example, the Sort Operations above would translate to the following Order By clause on the select statement: ORDER BY att_0x70000007 DESC          ,ABS( att_0x50000003 - @param_0x52000003 ) ASC The id in the SortOperation element identifies the Schema Attribute that to Order By. The sort can be one of four types: Ascending, Descending, Near, Far. Ascending and Descending are straightforward, and result in an Order By condition that looks like this: att_0x50000003 ASC Or this: att_0x50000003 DESC The Near and Far are more complicated. They allow you subtract the value of a parameter from an attribute, and then sort on the difference, either ascending or descending. Near corresponds to an Ascending sort, because the difference will be small when the attribute is   the parameter in value. Far corresponds to a Descending sort, because the difference will be large when the attribute is   from the parameter in value. The distanceid parameter indicates which parameter id to subtract from the attribute id, and may be any type compatible Property Parameter. Context cannot be used in Sort Operations. The sort operations are applied to the Order By clause in ascending order by their ordinal values in the xlast file. The precedence between title defined sort operations and system defined sorts is described in the standard and ranked query descriptions above.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation TitleMichael Fisher Normal.dot Michael Fisher Microsoft Office Word"yt}~ "yt># "ytf *bjbj\ Matchmaking Panorama Session Support Test Plan Introduction With the introduction of additional platforms (ex: PCs) under Panorama, we re adding support to Matchmaking to disallow cross-platform matchmaking per-title via LTC (Scenario 1a) and via NPDB setting (Scenario 1b) and per-search (Scenario 2).  For scenario #1b, for example, an exploit may be found on the PC version of a title and as a security response we can prohibit Xbox versions of the title from matching up with PC players to prevent unfair exploitation.  For scenario #2, for example, it s conceivable that a FPS player on an Xbox may feel PC players of the same title have a disproportionate advantage in games by using both the mouse and keyboard to play and so the player may wish to match only with other Xbox-based gamers. Cross-platform play is statically disallowable on a per-title basis by specifying this in the LTC, which propagates the setting into NPDB.  It is can also be configured dynamically via the NPDB setting.  The NPDB setting trumps create/search settings. Search Test Matrix Create a session according to the matrix (the  original  session) and one equivalent but unlocked session as well (the  unlocked  session). CreatedBy LockedBy SearchWith LockedSearch ExpectedSessions False False Neither Neither Create False Create False Unlocked Create Locked Create Neither False Locked False Neither Locked Neither False False Neither Neither Create False Unlocked Create False Create Neither Create Locked False Neither False Locked Neither Locked Steps to Repro Create an unlocked (control) session. Update the Match title info in NPDB if   is specified in the LockedBy method. Create a locked (test) session with a user appearing to be logged in on the CreatedBy platform. Search for the target sessions with a user logged in on the SearchWith platform, requiring a platform specific search if LockedSearch is True. Verify the session(s) returned match the expected sessions: Locked means only the locked session should be returned Unlocked means only the unlocked session should be returned Both means both sessions should be returned Neither means neither session should be returned Split the locked session and verify the new split session is found by Search gd+da gdAi] gdAi] gd9R2 gd9R2 gd9R2 gd9R2 gdf * ytf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gdf * gd$~v

Supported scenarios include cases where the session host disconnects from the network and where network interference prevents some of the session clients from communicating with the host or when the clients voluntarily elect a new host. Several approaches to testing this new protocol are being used: Protocol Property Testing XRLScan Limit Testing Scenario-based Testing Owners & Documentation PM Owner:  David Shaw PM Spec:  HYPERLINK "http://teamv2/sites/xbxe/Specification%20Library/Sessions%20and%20Matchmaking/Xbox%20Live%20Host%20Migration%20PM%20Spec.doc"  http://teamv2/sites/xbxe/Specification%20Library/Sessions%20and%20Matchmaking/Xbox%20Live%20Host%20Migration%20PM%20Spec.doc Dev Owner:  Jacob Repp Dev Spec:    HYPERLINK "http://xblwiki/default.aspx/XboxLive/HostMigration.html"  http://xblwiki/default.aspx/XboxLive/HostMigration.html Test Owner:  Michael Fisher Test Plan:  //depot/xonline/main/private/doc/server/match/test/ Protocol Testing Protocol testing focuses on positive and negative testing of protocol-specific properties including valid/invalid permutations, boundary conditions, and so forth. Protocol as Method Signature To facilitate thinking about protocol testing, it can be useful to deconstruct the XRL request as if it were an API call to consolidate the details into a concise method signature format.  The MatchSplit protocol can be modeled as: XONLINE_MATCH_SEARCHRESULT XeMatchSessionSplit(             DWORD               dwMessageLength;             XNKID               SessionID;             XNKID               SplitSessionID;             DWORD               dwTitleID;             XNADDR              HostAddress;             DWORD               dwNumAttributes;             UINT[]              rgdwAttrOffsets;             MatchAttribute[]    rgAttributes; XONLINE_MATCH_SEARCHRESULT: typedef struct _XONLINE_MATCH_SEARCHRESULT         {             DWORD               dwReserved;             XNKID               SessionID;             XNADDR              HostAddress;             XNKEY               KeyExchangeKey;             DWORD               dwPublicOpen;             DWORD               dwPrivateOpen;             DWORD               dwPublicFilled;             DWORD               dwPrivateFilled;             DWORD               dwNumAttributes;             UINT[]              rgdwAttrOffsets;             MatchAttribute[]    rgAttributes;         } XONLINE_MATCH_SEARCHRESULT XNKID:         // A session id is a 64 bit value.

MOSS will be responsible for managing the Xbox Live Master Key and decrypting secrets from the database.  This replaces the current implementation of distributing an environment s Master Key via a protected floppy disk.  The new implementation will store the master key on the MOSS server in an nCipher device. This document discusses the design and implementation issues pertaining to MOSS.  It will cover the implementation of the server and client code.  On the server side, it will identify details about the web interface, configuration settings and important events. Design This section discusses the design and implementation details of the MOSS server. Server The MOSS server will be a C# IIS front door server.  It will be responsible for receiving HTTP POST requests from clients for decrypting key data.  The incoming request will contain encrypted key data in the correct structure.  MOSS will decrypt this data, build a reply and encrypt the returning key data with a share secret.  It will not require an additional database work.  Attaining keys from the database will still be the responsibility of the client. Priority Level (1) Key Storage The master key for each environment will be stored in an nCipher device.  This device will ensure the safe storage.  For environment without need for nCipher protection, the master key will be a hard coded value within the code.  Encrypted data values within that environment will need to be encoded with   All environments with sensitive data must use the nCipher device key path.  (Example TestNet, PartnerNet, Production.)  Web Interface MOSS will not be a SOAP web-cache implementation.  All data will be passed as a binary structure in the HTTP POST body.  The basic implementation will also require a HTTP header which identifies who the caller is.  The id of the caller should be the service account name they are running under.  The HTTP header name will be: ACCOUNTNAME:<process account name> Failure to present this name will result in an ERROR event placed in the NT event logs, application log and trace messages.  This event will also log the requestor s IP address and port. Requests will be sent to the following URL: http://<servername>/MOSS/DecryptKeys.aspx (Note the aspx.  It is the standard extension for all non-SOAP HTTP front doors in Xbox Live) All other calls to the MOSS server should be cause a NT error event logging the IP address and port of the caller. Priority Level (1) Security Audit The MOSS server will make a log record of who is requesting decryption of what data.  We will add configuration setting to ensure that only specific servers have permissions to (a) access MOSS, (b) use MOSS to decrypt a specific key.  Requesting services will be identified using the ACCOUNTNAME HTTP header in the request.  Currently this is a weak method of ensuring the requestor is who they say they are; however this header will be added in the client code and malicious callers will have to know the protocol if they want to cause any damage. Priority Level (1) If time is permitting, we d like to turn on HTTP authentication on the MOSS server so we can ensure that the caller is who they say they are.  This implementation will remove the need for the ACCOUNTNAME http header.  However, since we ve never really tried this implementation of Live before it may require a little more work.  It is a lower priority security feature. Priority Level (3) Reply Encryption MOSS cannot simply send our decrypted key values over HTTP, even within our Live environment.  As such, key replies should be encrypted using a shared key.  The current design of MOSS will require a Nonce to be sent with the request which will be copied to the reply.  This Nonce will be calculated using the current time. Nonce[ 8 bytes] = Current Time in ticks The client will also be responsible for checking that the returning Nonce corresponds to the Nonce set in the request.  Since the nonce is the time, we will also check to ensure that this reply is not happen outside of a configured time span. The reply key data will be encrypted with a 128 bit key generated from the hash of: Key[16 bytes] = Sha1( Fixed Key | Nonce ) Both the client and the server will know this same fixed key.  The fixed key will actually be a hard-coded value in the code for both client and server.  This implementation is impossible for a hacker to without access to our code tree.  It provides an adequate level of protection for the first version of this product.  Priority Level (1) If time is permitting, this encryption shared key should be changed to a Diffie Hellman implementation. For more information about the Diffie Hellman algorithm, please read:  HYPERLINK "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2786.html"  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2786.html ll still send the Nonce so that the client can do a quick verification that the reply is something is it expecting.  However, we ll also pass a gX value in the request and a gY value in the reply.  (Note that   is a base integer value that will be hard-coded into the client and server (it will be 2).    and   will be random large integer values.  The encrypted key will then be: Key[16 bytes] = Sha1( gxy | Nonce ) This is a preferred solution since determining the values of x and y (if sufficient large) are extremely difficult to calculate.  It will not be the initial implemented solution only because of the algorithm s complexity. Priority Level (2) Important Structures The server and client will utilize the following structures. XLKEY Used to transport a specific keys data. typedef struct _XLKEY     WORD    _wMasterKeyVersion;           // key version of this key.                                  DWORD   _cbKey;                       // size of the key.     BYTE    _aKey[];                       }   XLKEY; _wMasterKeyVersion   The master key version which encrypts this key.  If the value is 0 then this information is unencrypted.   _cbKey   The number of bytes in the key array.  This value should never be zero. _aKey   the binary key (encrypted or decrypted).  We ll need to verify the size of this buffer using the POST data content length and _cbKey. XLMOSS_REQUEST Request structure that is sent from the client to the server.  This structure contains all key data that the client would like decrypted. typedef struct _XLMOSS_REQUEST     QWORD   _qwNonce;                     // the requestor's set Nonce.     //byte gToX[128];                     // g^x value for Diffie Hellman.     DWORD   _cEncryptedKeys;                   XLKEY   _aEncryptedKeys[];             }   XLMOSS_REQUEST; _qwNonce   Nonce setting for the request.  This will probably be a time stamp value.  It is set by the requestor. _cEncryptedKeys   The number of encrypted structures are in the request.  This value should be > 0. _aEncryptedKeys   An array of encrypted key structures. XLMOSS_REPLY   Reply sent from the server to the client.  It contains a buffer of encrypted data that is the master key decrypted keys presented in the request. typedef struct _XLMOSS_REPLY     QWORD   _qwNonce;                     // the nonce from teh request.     //byte gToY[128];                     // g^y value for Diffie Hellman.      DWORD   _cKeys;                            DWORD   _cbEncryptedResponse;              BYTE    _aEncryptedResponse[];         }   XLMOSS_REPLY; _qwNonce   Nonce setting for the request.  This will probably be a time stamp value.  It is set by the requestor and copied into the reply. _cKeys   The number of keys decrypted in this reply. _cbEncryptedResponse   The number of bytes in the encrypted response array.  This value should be >0.. _aEncryptedKeys   An blob of encrypted data from the MOSS server.  It can be decrypted with the special key.  The length of this value should be verified by the client using the Content-Length and _cbEncryptedResponse. Error Handling There are 2 types of errors that MOSS will need to be concerned about.   Malformed HTTP Requests These errors are due to requests not being properly setup.  If they are created by the client code then this should never happen.   However, should that happen it have to believe this is some type of hack attempt.  MOSS will pretend that is does not exist at this time  The result will be an HTTP status code of 404.  It will also cause an error NT event to be logged with the IP and Port of the requestor. Internal Setup Errors These errors will cause a HTTP status code of 500 response.  The error will be placed in the XErr HTTP header of the reply.  These errors will be caused by invalid ini file settings or a failure to talk to the nCipher device.  This will cause a error NT event to be logged. Settings On the server there will be the following settings. [MOSS] UseNCipher=0(false) or 1(true, use the nCipher device implementation).  Default is 1. NumOfAllowServices=The number of service sections to read into the permitted table.  Default is 0. [SERVICE#]  (0..NumOfAllowServices instances permitted) AccountName=The account name that this service will run as.  This cannot be empty. PermittedKeyTypes=Comma delimited list of permitted key type decryption allowed for this server.  This should not be empty. Management Commands MOSS will expose the following management commands through the XMGMT console. reload   Tells MOSS to renew its context handle with the nCipher device. Logging Format Performance Counters At this time, the only counters we will notice are: Requests Total. Requests Per Second. Failed Requests Total. Failed Requests Per Second. Invalid Requests Total. Invalid Requests Per Second. Successful Replies Total. Successful Replies Per Second. More will be added if necessary. Events TO DO: (lohab) Fill this in when you know the events. XEVENT_MOSS_INVALID_SETTTINGS   Settings in the MOSS configuration were invalid. XEVENT_MOSS_EXTERNAL_DEVICE_ERROR   The external private key management device has caused an error. XEVENT_MOSS_INVALID_REQUEST   MOSS received an invalid request from a client.  The message contains the IP and port of the offender.  Please investigate this occurrence. XEVENT_MOSS_INIT_SUCCESS   MOSS has successfully been initialized. XEVENT_MOSS_INIT_FAILED   MOSS failed to initialize correctly. Client The client code for MOSS is as important as the servers since it would be ideal to have 1 method of talking to which all servers can adapt too.  It makes the addition of MOSS much easier to the Live service.  The ideal solution is to simply re-write the current DecryptWithMasterKey function to perform the MOSS lookup.  The question is, do we want to make it possible for the client to decrypt numerous entries at one time?  DecryptWithMasterKey does not currently support that.  This is could a later feature. We have 2 different client implementations (C++ and C#), so we ll have to make modifications in both areas.  One of the possible solutions to this is to create a DLL for this call instead of 2 separate implementations.  However, this adds extra dependencies to the server and complicates the install.  Making a C++ and C# version keeps the setup of these servers simpler.  Note that the client will be present on numerous machines. C++ Servers C++ servers will have a more difficult implementation.  The common path will be the sample however.  The C++ server will call DecryptWithMasterKey.  DecryptWithMasterKey will build the necessary structures, open an HTTP connection and send the request to MOSS.  The client is responsible for waiting a configured amount of time for a response.  This implementation will be stored in a public place for all servers to use.  It will be integrated with our current crypto helper tools. WinHttp Component C++ servers will be using WinHttp to send.  The code for this implementation is already complete and working for the UDPAdapter.  As a result, C++ servers that use MOSS will also require the WINHTTP.dll library to operate.  The C++ implementation for this must be put in a public place for all servers to use. C# Servers C# servers already have built in HTTP tools.  They will construct an HTTP request with the encrypted key information.  Send the request and wait a configured amount of time for the response.  The implementation of this code will be placed in the CryptMgr class in common tools. Management Commands All client servers that use MOSS should expose the following commands: reloadkeys    Gets encrypted keys from the database and sends them to MOSS for decryption. Settings [Security] MOSSServer=Server location of the MOSS service. MOSSPort=Port to send the request. ServiceId=Id of the requesting service WaitTimeInSeconds=Time to wait for a response from MOSS. ConnectionPollInSeconds=Time to wait before trying to find the MOSS server again. Events These are the current defined events.  More events will follow as deemed necessary. XEVENT_SECURITY_INVALID_RESPONSE   The response from the MOSS server was invalid. XEVENT_SECURITY_RESPONSE_DECRYPTION_FAILED   The response from the MOSS server was invalid. XEVENT_SECURITY_NO_MOSS   The client cannot find the MOSS server. XEVENT_SECURITY_CONNECTED_MOSS   The client was able to talk to MOSS. Usage The MOSS server will be a ASP .Net application.  It will be started and managed through IIS. 1.  Question:  Can the XMACS/XKDC be started without these servers being up and running.  What is the failure plan?   Answer:  Client servers will require XMOSS before they can properly start.  The Client API will return an error when MOSS is not found.  It will also fire an event to inform operators that this action failed.  The client should not error out.  It should infact go into a "not ready yet" state and continue to POLL MOSS until it gets an answer.  We'll have to add a new setting to the clients (XMACS/XKDC) for security server poll time. 2.  Question:  How will the client servers interface with MOSS?   Answer:  No changes are necessary to the client servers.  They will still use DecryptWithMasterKey, which will need to be re-written to use MOSS. This function exists in both C++ and C# form. 3.  Question:  If a client requested multiple keys to be decrypted -- how does it know the size and location of each one in the response?  Does the client simply have to match it up to the array of XLKEYs that it sent in the request?   Answer:  When the client receives this reply... It first has to decrypt the data in _aEncryptedReponse. The result is an array of XLKEYS of size _cKey.

M1 Milestone:  matchmaking front door server will be rewritten in C#. instead of reading configuration information from local ini file, it reads from config DB instead: t_match_titles table will now live in NPDB instead of lives in every db partition; session cache time is now the only configurable parameter through configDB DeadXBox and DeadSG requests will be sent from SG instead of monitoring servers. xmatch.dll will live with other stateless front door servers  dll in one box. M2 Milestone:  No changes. M3 Milestone:  For xenon release, 3 new xrl are created. See Section 7.2.1 for details M4 Milestone:  Social match and ranked match coming in  Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone: Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. Since front door will be rewritten in C#, there will be some test cases need to be changed. Performance Test: I will need to run stress/performance testing to get a profile of how new matchmaking front door performs. M2 Milestone:  Same as M1. M3 Milestone:  Due to late check in of match codes, only positive functional cases will be written and run for this release. Goals Discuss your test goals for each milestone.   M1 Milestone:  1. Since my server is being rewritten from C++ to C#, my goal is to use 80% of my existing tests by re-running them against the front door. 20% existing test cases which talk directly to matchDB backend need to be modified. Rerunning existing tests against the front door will validate that there has been no behavior change in server since the previous release.   2. I will also be writing new test cases to validate the new configuration settings being pulled from the configuration database vs. the previous local initialization file method. 3. Performance testing will be done against the newly written front door. M2 Milestone:  Same as M1 M3 Milestone: 100% pass rate for all xbox1 functional tests 100% pass rate for all positive cases for Xenon functional tests. Non-Goals Clearly state the dividing line between what you will be covering and what you won t be covering for each milestone. M1 Milestone:  Basic performance test will be done to get a profile of new front door servers; but fully loaded stress test won t be done for this milestone. M2 Milestone:  Same as M1. M3 Milestone: Negative cases for some xenon functionals. Match stress? Related Documents Reference any documents (via its path in CoreXT) that relate to your test plan. Functional Testing Summary Write a summary for your test methodology as it relates to the complete test matrix. The matchmaking server has the following APIs: CreateSession, UpdateSession, DeleteSession, SearchSession, DeadXBox and DeadSG. Functional testing will strive to test the matrix surrounding this API set. Test Case Matrix New Test Cases per Milestone M5 Milestone:  All configDB related test cases will be moved to this milestone. I opened bug 38503 to track this issue. ConfigDB related test cases:  XMatchTitleInfoDBName: since t_match_titles now lives in NPDB, no need for this testing anymore. defaultSessionExpiration: why I can t find it in the VSFixTraces\Settings.cs file, but it is in the ndpb t_settings table? relaxXenonValidation: SessionCacheExpiration: (assume this change can be picked up dynamically; no restart server required). Using sql stored procedure call to add a row to t_environment_setting_overrides to change this setting dynamically; write test cases to see if new settings have been picked up correctly The following config settings are in the npdb: Xmatchfd_valueOfFriend Xmatchfd_valueOfPrefer Xmatchfd_valueOfCompleted Xmatchfd_valueOfAvoid Xmatchfd_valueOfAvoidMe Are these settings being changed in production? If so, since no service call back handler is implemented, how to dynamically change these settings? Answer: manually reset the application pool is a better way to make the new setting takes effect. For my test, I will just make sure whatever value  we use in the npdb is being used in the match.  M4 Milestone:  Stress Testing: Since 1 title is not able to fully stress sql server (sql is able to cache two tables in the cache), we choose 10 titles will be used for stress testing.  Every title will have exact the same xlast configuration except titleID. Properties and context: one property and context for each data type: one int32 property one int 64 property one float32 property one float 64 property one dateTime property one context 4 match query that will be used by both social match and ranked match: maxResults = 50 Parameters: takes all the above 6 custom attributes + default ones (game_type, game_mode, mu,sigma,rating, country,lang,gamerZone, host_name, gamerPUID).  Filters: use all the above 6 custom properties in the filter. Returns: all the above 6 attributes + default ones (session_value,host_name,gamer_zone). Sort Operations: one query sort by Int64 one query sort by float64 one query sort by dateTime one query sort by int64, float64 and dateTime. Programmatically configurable settings in query: ratio of 4 types of query, + system defined FindByID query ranked query versus social query ratio null search parameter ratio: each title defined search parameter can be null, and the probability of each parameter to be null is configurable. x number of open sessions will be created upon test starts up: some meet title defined criteria, others don t. the mix is configurable. Social match: for each social match search request, different searchUserPUID is being used. And x number of affiliates will be returned. X is centered around 300. Within each affiliate list, there are five types of affiliates friend complete positive negative avoidMe The ratio of each type is configurable. Social Match: Inter-service call between match front door and presence front door: HR returned by presence for queryAffiliates call: E_NOSUCHUSER E_OUTOFMEMORY, etc I need to make sure whatever result code presence returned to match, match front door can handle it correctly. Test cases: a non-existent user send search session requests:  presence server knows nothing about the user (user isn t registered in uodb);  no affiliate query is being performed.  an existent user send search session request, check the social match is actually performed. This case can be covered by the following six passes tests. xmatchfd_disableAffiliateQuery: Disable communication with presence: turn on this config setting, check affiliate positive sessions still being returned but in title defined sort order and the session value is 0. Four passes of social match query: There are four passes of doing a social match query. All test cases will work for title that either in single db or multiple dbs. Pass 0: sessions with positive affiliations, in the same gamer zone; Pass 1: sessions in the same gamer zone, with no negative affiliations Pass 2: sessions with positive affiliations, in different gamer zone Pass 3: sessions with no negative affiliations, in different gamer zone There are 5 types of affiliates that match server cares about, so the total combinations of different affiliates that s in the same session are 31, assume each affiliate is only associated with one user. SessionValue Positive(2) Negative(-3) Friend(4) Complete(1) AvoidMe(-3) Positive Test cases: PSingleUserMultiPosAffiliate: Create one session and associate it with userA.  userA has friend, complete, positive relationships with searchUser make a social match request and make sure the session is returned with the right session value. PSingleUserMultiNegAffiliate: Create one session and associate it with userA.  userA has negative and avoidMe relationships with searchUser make a social match request and make sure the session is not returned. PAffilliateSameZoneMainLine: Create 31 sessions. Each session  has one of the above affiliates combinations. Thus, each session can have positive, negative or 0 session values. Meet title defined criteria Game_type is standard Game_mode is the same as the one passed in query Public slot is > 0 Compatibable NAT Same mu/sigma/lang/country/rating (the value of these won t matter since there are no enough sessions available so they won t be used at all). Check Results: Only positive and 0 session values are returned in the right order Title defined sort operations won t matter PAffiliateSameZoneMixedSession: Create 31 sessions like the above Create additional five sessions, that One session doesn t meet title defined criteria One session is ranked match One session that has public available slots set to 3. (search request will request public available slots >=4). One session has incompatible NAT One session s game_mode is different Check Results: The results should be the same as case1 PNonAffiliateSameZoneMainLine: Create 1 affiliate session with positive session values that meet all criteria, Create 1 affiliate session with negative values that meet all criteria, Create 3 non-affiliate sessions with different title defined sortBy attribute values Check Results: Positive affiliate sessions returned 1st 3 non-affiliate sessions returned in the order of title defined sort criteria PNonAffiliateSameZoneMixedSessions: In addition to the sessions created in case 3,  Create 5 bad sessions as in case 2 Check results: Should be the same as 3 PAffiliateDifferentZoneMainLine: Create 31 sessions, each session  has different gamerzone as searchUser has one of the above affiliates combinations. Thus, each session can have positive, negative or 0 session values. Meet title defined criteria Game_type is standard Game_mode is the same as the one passed in query Public slot is > 0 Compatibable NAT Same mu/sigma/lang/country/rating (the value of these won t matter since there are no enough sessions available so they won t be used at all). CheckResults: Only sessions with positive and 0 values are returned and in the descending order PAffiliateDifferentZoneMixedSession: Create 31 sessions just like case 5. Create another 5 bad sessions with different gamerZone. CheckResults: Should be the same as case 5 PAffiliateDifferentZoneMixedSession2: Create 1 positive affiliate same gamer zone session that meet all criteria Create 1 negative affiliate same gamer zone session that meet all criteria Create 1 non-affiliate same gamer zone session in each of the db that title lives in Create 1 positive affiliate different gamer zone session Check Results: Positive same gamerZone returned 1st Non-affiliate same gamer zone returned second Positive different gamer zone returned last PNonAffiliateDifferentGamerZoneMainline:  Create 1 positive affiliate and 1 negative same gamer zone session Create 1 non-affiliate same gamer zone in each db Create 1 positive affiliate different gamer zone Create 3 non affiliate different gamer zone with different title defined sortBy attribute values Check Results: Positive same zone returned 1st Non-affiliate same zone returned 2nd Positive different zone returned 3rd 3 non affiliate different zone returned last, but in the title defined sortBy order PNonAffiliateDifferentGamerZoneMixedSession: create sessions that are same as case 8 create additional 5 different gamerzone bad sessions  Check Results: Should be the same as case 8. PEmptyAffiliateList: Create an PNUser that has no affiliate online and in the same title Create another non-affiliate session that meets all title defined criteria Make a social match request Check results: The non-affiliate session is returned. P1000PosAffiliateList: Create 500 complete, 500 positive for searchUser. They meet all title defined criteria and are all good sessions. Make a social match request Check results: Make sure 25 positive sessions returned. The following test cases is to test Pass1 and Pass3 ratings filter: PSameZoneDifferentRatingsLevel1: enough sessions available that ratings will be used in filter and language/country and skill will be used in sort searchUser s rating is 50, available sessions  rating is 50+-0.0016 Create 1 positive and 1 negative same zone session Create 101 non-affiliate same gamer zone session in each match db that title lives in: Session1 is within next range 0.08, but has same lang and same country, and the largest titledefined sortBy attribute values. 100 sessions is within ratings range 0.0016 Among the 100 sessions, 99 are within 0.00008 range, 100th is within 0.0016 Among 99 sessions, some with the same country and lang; some with same country only; some with same lang only; some has neither the same The 99 sessions has two different title defined sortBy attribute values, either 0 or 1 The 99 sessions has different mu values (using an excel sheet, it shows that given the values I used for this test, the larger mu is, the smaller the drawprobability is). Create 1 positive different gamer zone session Create 1 non affiliate different gamer zone session. Check results: numResults in the query is defined as 25 25 sessions returned 1 positive same zone session returned 1st Different gamer zone sessions won t be returned The session1 within range 0.08 won t be rturned. 24 Same zone non-affiliate sessions will be returned  a) they all within 100 sessions b) same lang and country returned first, although it s ratings is within bigger range and it s title defined sortBy attribute values are larger c) same language returned 2nd, with title defined sortBy acending order; when title defined sortBy is the same, it use draw probability descending order. d) same country returned 3rd, with title defined sortBy asending order; when title defined sortBy is the same, it use draw probability descending order. e) neither the same returned last same as case 10 except we will use range 0.08. same as case 10 except we will use range 0.4 same as case 10 except we will use range 2.0. same as case 10 except we will use range 10.0. same as case 10 except we will use range 50.0: but this time the search result is different:  session1 will be returned and it will be returned in the 2nd place. searchUser s rating is 0 and the range is 0.0016 (ie available sessions  rating is 0.0016) searchUser s rating is 100 and the range is 10 (ie available sessions  rating is 90) repeat case 10-17, but sessions have different gamer zone. PSearchResultHostName: create a session with host_name set to a string value, send a search request and check the host_name is returned as the second last attribute in the result set. PLotsSessions: add > 1000 sessions with exact the same ratings, make a search request and check there is results bein returned. PLotsSession: add > 1000 sessions with the sact same mu for ranked matchc, make a search request and check there is results being returned. PLessSessionsCountryLang: Create a session with the neither same lang and country as searchUser Create 2nd session with the same country as searchuser Create 3rd session with the same lang as searchuser Create 4th session with both same lang and same country as searchuser Check results: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st returned in this order. Negative Test cases: NCreateBadMuSigmaRating: create social session with mu set to  0.0001/-0.0001/-0.0001 or 6.0001/1.0001/100.0001, check database directly make sure 0 or 6/1/100 is being logged. NCreateNoHostName: send a create session request without pass host_name attribute, check empty string is returned in the search results as host_name. NUpdateBadMuSigmaRating: same as 1. NUserNotFound: userX who initiates search request is not in the presence system: no social match is performed NSearchNoGameMode: (bug 27096. they are not required anymore). Create a session with gameMode set to 1 Send a search request without passing gameMode Check the session is not returned. (default 0 is used.) NSearchNoGameType: Create a session with gameType set to 1 Send a search request without passing gameType Check the session is not returned (default 0 is used). NSearchNoGamerZone: same as 4 and 5. NSearchUserNoRating: default 0 is used Create 100 sessions with rating set to 0.0016; create another one with rating set to 0.08. Check results: make sure rating with 0.08 is not returned. NSearchNocountryLang: default 0 is being used. Create 100 sessions with both country and lang set to 0, rating within 0.08;  create another one with country and lang set to 1, but rating is within 0.0016, Check results: make sure the one with country and lang set to 1 is not returned. NSearchNoMuSigma: default mu=3, sigma=1 is being used. Create 100 sessions with mu set to 3 and sigma set to 1, rating within 0.08, country/lang is the same as serachUser. Create another one session with mu set to 2 and sigma set to 0, rating within 0.0016, title defined sortBy the same as the above 100 sessions ; country/lang is the same as searchUser. Check results: make sure the one with mu sigma 2 is not returned. NSearchNoPuid: default 0 is used, which means no social match is used; just check searchreq won t return any error. NSearchUserBadRatings:searchUser s rating is out of range: -0.0001, check the results is the same as rating 0; if it s 100.0001, check the results is the same as rating 100 NSearchUserBadMuSigma: searchUser s mu=6.0001, sigma=-0.0001 Create 100 sessions with mu set to 6 and sigma set to 0, rating within 0.08, country/lang is the same as serachUser. Create another one session with mu set to 2 and sigma set to 0, rating within 0.0016, title defined sortBy the same as the above 100 sessions ; country/lang is the same as searchUser. Check results: make sure the one with mu sigma 2 is not returned. Ranked Match: Apply game defined filter first, then using skill to return sessions with matching draw probability For this ranked match search, we will use a query: Return max 25 sessions Does not use any title defined sort criteria Has title defined filter I will use a title that s configured in a single sql db to do all ranked match tests. Positive Test cases: PDefaultAttrib: check session value is returned as the last attribute in the search result and it s value is always 0. The following test cases for ranked match all have enough sessions (>=100) available so that mu and sigma will be used in search request. An excel spread sheet is being used to calculate draw probability based on mu and sigma values. PValidMuSigma1: all sessions have valid mu(0-6) and sigma (0-1) searchUser s mu is 3, sigma is 0.01; available sessions  mu is 3+-0.00096, but with different sigma values. Create 101 available sessions: Session1 mu is within next range 0.0048, but with sigma value set to 1 Among the 100 sessions: All sessions s mu is within range 0.00096 1 sessions has the same mu  and sigma as search user (3), make sure it always returned first.(This is not true!!!) 100 sessions has the same mu, but not the same as search user; different sigma Create session 2 that does not meet title defined search criteria, but has the same Mu as searchUser and sigma as 0. Check results: numResults in the query is defined as 25 25 sessions returned Session 1 won t be returned Session 2 won t be returned All returned session are a) within 100 sessions same as case 10 except we will use range 0.0048. same as case 10 except we will use range 0.024 same as case 10 except we will use range 0.12 same as case 10 except we will use range 0.6 PSearchUserZeroMuSigma: available session s mu range is 0.00096(i.e. mu is 0.00096): Create 1 session mu is 0.00097, sigma is 0 make sure this session won t be returned. Create 100 sessions that mu is 0.00096, with different sigma values Check results: 25 sessions returned with draw probability descending PSearchUserMaxMuSigma: available session s mu range is 0.12(i.e. mu is 6-0.12=5.88) Create 1 session mu is 5.87, sigma is 1 make sure this session won t be returned. Create 100 sessions that mu is 5.88, with different sigma values Check results: 25 sessions returned with draw probability descending PAllZeroMuSigma: available sessions s mu and sigma is 0, search user s mu and sigma is also 0. just check there are sessions returned. PAllMaxMuSigma: available sessions s mu 6 and sigma is 1, search user s mu 6 and sigma is also 1. just check there are sessions returned. PTitleDefinedSort: use a query that has title defined sortBy int32 attribute that in descending order, which will be applied before draw probability. Create 100 sessions that meet title defined search criteria and mu s range are all within 0.0048. among these 100 sessions: 10 sessions have the same sortBy attribute =0, draw probability is different 15 sessions have the same sortBy attribute=1; draw probability is different 75 sessions have sortBy attribute = 3; and mu is within 0.00096.  Check results: 75 sessions with sortBy 3 are not returned, which can verify title defined sort is applied first. 15 sessions with sortBy attrib 1 returned 1st,  10 sessions with sortBy attrib 0 returned next. PRankedMatchMainLine: searchUser s mu=3 and sigma=0.5 Create 10 sessions. each session has different mu(0-6) and sigma(0-1) value Check results: 10 sessions returned with draw probability is in descending order. Negative Test cases: NCreateBadMuSigmaRating1: same as the test case in social match. NUpdateBadMuSigmaRating1: same as the test case in social match. NSearchUserBadMuSigma:  Create 100 sessions with mu=6 and sigma set to 0.001 Create another session with mu set to 3 and sigma set to 0.5 Do a ranked search with mu=6.001 and sigm=0.001 Check results: The session with mu =3 is not returned.  NSearchUserNoMuSigma: Create 100 sessions with mu=3 and sigma set to 1 Create another session with mu set to 6 and sigma set to 0.5 Do a ranked search without passing mu and sigma Check results: The session with mu =6 is not returned.  NSearchNoGameMode: (bug 27096. they are not required anymore). Create a session with gameMode set to 0 Send a search request without passing gameMode Check the session is returned. (default 0 is used.) NSearchNoGameType: Create a session with gameType set to 0 Send a search request without passing gameType Check the session is not returned (default 0 is used). NSearchNoGamerZone: same as 4 and 5. M3 Milestone:  For all xenon matchmaking tests, xlast will be used to create title/attribute/queries. CreateSession: New xrl: xmatchhost2.ashx new data type are being added: int32/int64/float32/float64/dateTime/string blob is not supported as session attributes doesn t allow XNET_XNKID_SYSTEM_LINK flag when create session All schema attributes are allowed to be null. Context is the new enum type Note that for all xenon createSession requests, it will pass nine session attributes by default (game_mode and game_type, gamerZone, gamer_country, gamer_lang,gamer_rating, gamer_mu, gamer_sigma and host_name). Positive cases: create a session without passing any custom attributes (only with default session attributes). create a session with X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL as attributeID create a session with system property only (i.e. gamername property). create a session with gamer_puid along with other default session attributes create a session with max int32 attributes create a session with max int64 attributes. pass int32 value to a int64 attribute create a session with max float32 attributes. create a session with max float16 attributes. create a session with dateTime attribute (datetime.maxvalue) create a session with max length string attributes (for gamername). create a session with empty string attributes. (for gamername). create a session with a small string attribute (16byte long) create a session with public/private available slots set to 0 create an online xenon hosted session create an online PC hosted session create an online title hosted session create a session with userPUID sent as attribute create a session without userPUID sent as attribute These are all positive cases since on the wire they are all 64 bits which can be interpreted as integer. try to create a string attrib with int32/64 value try to create a int32 attrib with int64 value try to create int 32/64 with float32/64 value try to create context with float value try to create context with string value try to create dateTime with a float value try to create datetime with string value try to create datetime with non-dateTime int value Negative cases: create a session with blob attrib create a systemlink session for xenon title create a session with duplicate context attirubte IDs (game_mode) create a session with the same two property attributeIDs. create a session with duplicate default attributes (game_type) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_zone) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_country) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_lang) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_rating) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_mu) create a session with duplicate default attributes (gamer_sigma) create a session without any default attributes create a session without one of the default attributes(bug 27096): the default attributes are not required, if client do not send them, default  values will be used. passing null as value to one of the default attrbitues send a create session request with message length shorter than XMATCH_SESSION message length longer than available bytes create a session with unknown titleID create a session with non-existent context attributeID create a session with non-existent property attributeID create a session with attribute offset inside header create a session with attribute offset beyond available create a session with attribute offset equal to current offset indicate more attribute than available create session with zero-length string attribute create a session with a string attirube whose length is beyond what s available create a session with a string attribute MAXLEN + 1 bytes(null not included) create a session with a string that is not null terminated. invalid case: create a session with a non-existent context value(server won t catch it) create a session with non-existent attributeID UpdateSession: New xrl: xmatchhost2.ashx new data type are being added: int32/int64/float32/float64/dateTime/string blob is not supported as session attributes All schema attributes are allowed to be null. Positive cases: send an updateRequest with attributeID set to X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL add new int32 attribute (set value for this attribute for 1st time, i.e. change from null to real value) add new int64 attribute add new float32 attribute add new float64 attribute add new datetime attribute add new context attribute add new string attribute update existing int32/64/float32/float64/datetime/context attribute values. update an existing string attribute modify public/private/open/filled slots decrement private/public open slots to zero update gameMode/mu/sigma/lang/country/rating/zone attributes . update gameType with the same value. Negative cases: try to update with blob attribute try to update with a nonexistent context attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property Int32 attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property int 64 attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property float32 attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property float 64 attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property datetime attributeID try to update with a nonexistent property int 64 attributeID try to update a nonexistent string attribute try to update GameType with different value. dwMessageLength is shorter than the actual updateSession request length dwMessageLength is larger than actual dwNumAttributes is smaller than what s actually passed in dwNumAttributes is larger than what s actually passed in. try to update a nonexistent session SearchSession: New xrl: xmatchclient2.ashx full attributeID instead of dataType is returned in searchResults full attributeID instead of dataType is used for all search parameters. search parameters passed on the wire don t have to be in the correct order as they were defined in xlast. All search parameters are allowed to be null new data type are allowed in search parameters:  int32/int64/float32/float64/dateTime blob/string are not allowed in search parameters. no aggregate queries no title defined FindByID queries. Positive Cases: search so that 0 session returned. search so that 1 session with int32/64/float32/64/datetime/context returned. search so that 1 session without custom attributes returned (only gameType and gameMode in the return list). search so that 2 sessions with custom attributes returned. search so that 2 sessions without custom attributes returned. Create one sp that takes  int32/64/float32/64/datetime/context/gamemodetype as parameters,  Use all the above parameters in the filter. Return int32/64/float32/64/datetime/context/gamemodeType/string as final attributes this sp will be used by following tests: pass all non-null parameter to the above sp, but add an additional X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL search pareamterID with null value pass X_ATTRIBUTE_DATATYPE_NULL as searchParameter IDs to the above query search with dateTime as search parameter and use it in the filter; only max/min/normal dateTime with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search with float32 as search parameter and use it in the filter, only max/min/normal flaot32 with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search with float64 as search parameter and use it in the filter, only max/min/normal float64 with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search with int32 as search parameter and use it in the filter, only max/min/normal int32 with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search with int64 as search parameter and use it in the filter, only max/min/normal int64 with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search with context as search parameter and use it in the filter,only context with real value returned in the session (other attributes are null) search so that a non-null string attributes returned in the search results pass no parameters to above sp, and all title defined return attributes are NULL. create 2 sessions with different attributes value, pass no parameter to above sp, check all sessions are returned. pass all non-NULL parameters to above sp, and all non-null attributes returned. return max/empty/normal length string attribute in the middle of the attribute list return max/empty/normal length string attribute in the first of the attribute list return max/empty/normal length string attribute in the last of the attribute list End of using the above sp search with a sp that takes no title defined parameters and return only default attributes(i.e.gamemode and gametype and session_value) SameTypefuzzymatch: fuzzy matching with all sessions has the Int32same value as the centerValue dateTimefuzzymatch: fuzzy matching with all sessions has different dateTime values as the centerValue fuzzymatch int32 attributes with float32 center value fuzzymatch: using two sort statements crossTypeFilter: use the following in query filter: int64 with float32;int32 with float64;float64 with int64; float32 with int32. fuzzymatch: comparison attribute on near/far sorts is a constant type.(no xlast support yet) search with a sp that using a schema attribute in a sort criteria, while this attribute is not in the return list. search using a float32,float64,datetime,int32,int64 constants in the filter (no xlast datetime filter support) host session and client are both strictNAT, but having same inaOnline. Session should be returned. host session is strictNAT, client is strict and send FindByID query, session should be returned. PC-based host has NAT=0, which is the same as open, client is Open/moderate/strict session should be returned. host session is open, client is open/moderate/strict, session should be returned. host session is strict, client is open/moderate/strict, only open is returned. host session is moderate, client is moderate/open/strict, moderate/open will be returned. Throtting test: check x-delay header multipleDB: using a title that lives on two db, do the same query twice in a row and check results are different. Negative Cases: pass a parameter to a sp that takes no parameter NInt32SameTypeWrongID1: a sp that takes int32 parameter A as a search parameter; send a query request with int32 parameter B NInt64SameTypeWrongID1: a sp that takes int64 parameter A as a search parameter; send a query request with int64 parameter B NFloat32SameTypeWrongID1: a sp that takes float32 parameter A as a search parameter; send a query request with float32 parameter B NFloat64SameTypeWrongID1: a sp that takes float64 parameter A as a search parameter; send a query request with float64 parameter B NDateTimeSameTypeWrongID: a sp that takes datetime parameter A as a search parameter; send a query request with datetime parameter B NContextWrongID: send context paramter2 to a sp that takes context paramter1 as search parameter try an aggregated query (using aggregated sp index). try to pass a string parameter to a query. try to pass blob parameter to a query pass duplicate parameters search with FindByID and valid sessionID, but wrong(valid) title, no session should be returned. search with FindByID and valid sessionID, but non-existent title, invalid_title_id should be returned. search with FindByID and invalid sessionID, no session is returned search using a nonexistent stored procedure; ivalid_search_request search with unknonn title: invalid_title_id search with dwMessageLength set to less than the required search structure dwMessageLength is larger than actual request length dwNumUsers is larger than max allowed client NAT type is invalid (0/1/2/3 are valid types): invalid_flags are returned. send no search parameter to FindById query send wrong search parameterID to findByID query send a request that s missing all 9 default search parameters send a match request with missing mu/sigma/ZONE/lang/country/rating/mode/type/puid:bug 27096. these parameters are not required, default values will be used if they re missing. pass non-existent parameterID to a search request DeleteSession: new xrl: xmatchdelete2.ashx no other changes. M2 Milestone:  For M2, there is new API added for match: TitleChange.ashx Here is a list of test cases: Positive cases: send a titleChange message with SGAddr set to max value send a titleChange message with SGAddr set to min value call titleChange so that more than 1 sessions will be deleted send batched titleChange messages in one request send mixed batched titleChange messages (half messages are valid; half messages are for nonexistent titleID) Negative cases: send a titlechange message, but set length larger than actual send a titlechange message, but set length smaller than actual send titlechange message with unknown titleID (but match frond door will still returns S_OK) M1 Milestone:  Any test cases that need to talk to matchDB directly will be updated. There is no change expected from matchmaking perspective regarding DeadSG and DeadXBox messages handling.

MOSS will be responsible for managing the Xbox Live Master Key and decrypting secrets from the database.  This replaces the current implementation of distributing an environment s Master Key via a protected floppy disk.  The new implementation will store the master key on the MOSS server in an nCipher device. Services will retrieve their encrypted key from the UODB, send the key to the MOSS, which will decrypt it and send back to the service.  This reply is also encrypted using a shared key.   SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT  M1 Milestone MOSS is a new component for M1, so this test plan will cover all functional and stress tests. M2 Milestone Schedule Each milestone will have a standard set of test deliverables including: Test Plan Complete   Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete   Functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet.  Complete implementation of cases old and new outlined in Test Plan. Test Stress Code Complete   Stress test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Functional Test Complete   Function test code modified and running against service.  Functional tests are passing at the defined % for the milestone. Test Stress Complete   Stress code modified and running against service.  Stress tests are performing at the defined transactions per second (TPS) per service API for the milestone. Test Complete   Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff. The dates for these deliverables will be set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management. M1 Milestone Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases.  There is no required stress testing for M1 so the  Test Stress Code Complete  and  Test Stress Complete  deliverables do not apply to this milestone. M2 Milestone Goals This section lists what will be covered for each milestone. M1 Milestone Test correct functionality of MOSS server. Test security features of MOSS, to make sure servers can only decrypt their own key. Test use of configuration DB. Test error handling. Test internal setup errors. Establish baseline TPS. M2 Milestone Non-Goals This section lists what will not be covered for each milestone. M1 Milestone Consolidation of this server with another will not be tested, as we currently don t know which server MOSS will live on. M2 Milestone Related Documents $corext\private\doc\server\moss\MOSS Security Design.doc Functional Testing Summary MOSS only receives 1 kind of request and only returns 1 kind of reply.  The maximum request size is limited by XRLScan, which will be filtering all requests to MOSS.  There are 2 classes of errors.  It also responds to xmgmtc commands, performs logging, and provides performance counters.  There will be 2 MOSS servers behind a VIP.  Tests will focus on these areas. MOSS is a C# IIS front door server that receives HTTP POST requests.  It does not require an additional database  server components are responsible for obtaining keys from the database.  New Test Cases for M1 Milestone Overview of structures: typedef struct _XLKEY     WORD    _wMasterKeyVersion;           // key version of this key.                                  DWORD   _cbKey;                       // size of the key.     BYTE    _aKey[];                       }   XLKEY; _wMasterKeyVersion   The master key version which encrypts this key.  If the value is 0 then this information is unencrypted.   _cbKey   The number of bytes in the key array.  This value should never be zero. _aKey   the binary key (encrypted or decrypted).  We ll need to verify the size of this buffer using the POST data content length and _cbKey. typedef struct _XLMOSS_REQUEST     QWORD   _qwNonce;                     // the requestor's set Nonce.     DWORD   _cEncryptedKeys;                   XLKEY   _aEncryptedKeys[];             }   XLMOSS_REQUEST; _qwNonce   Nonce setting for the request.  This will probably be a time stamp value.  It is set by the requestor. _cEncryptedKeys   The number of encrypted structures are in the request.  This value should be > 0. _aEncryptedKeys   An array of encrypted key structures. typedef struct _XLMOSS_REPLY     QWORD   _qwNonce;                     // the nonce from teh request.     DWORD   _cKeys;                            DWORD   _cbEncryptedResponse;              BYTE    _aEncryptedResponse[];         }   XLMOSS_REPLY; _qwNonce   Nonce setting for the request.  This will probably be a time stamp value.  It is set by the requestor and copied into the reply. _cKeys   The number of keys decrypted in this reply. _cbEncryptedResponse   The number of bytes in the encrypted response array.  This value should be >0.. _aEncryptedKeys   An blob of encrypted data from the MOSS server.  It can be decrypted with the shared key.  The length of this value should be verified by the Content-Length header and _cbEncryptedResponse field. Header tests Requests are passed as binary structures in the HTTP POST body.  The ACCOUNTNAME HTTP header is used for logging who the requestor is.  Any value is acceptable as it is only used for logging purposes. No ACCOUNTNAME   request fails, MOSS logs error in NT event logs, application log, and trace messages, and will also log the requestor s IP address and port. Non-alphanumeric ACCOUNTNAME   request succeeds, successful app log of name. Typical ACCOUNTNAME   request succeed, successful app log of name. MasterKeyVersion tests The MasterKeyVersion specificied in XLKEY is used to indicate which master key to use for decrypting requests.  The master key is stored on the Ncipher device.  Only one master key should be in use at a given time.  The current master key version in use across the service will be specified as a ConfigDB setting for MOSS. ConfigDB specifies a MasterKeyVersion that does not exist on the Ncipher device.  MOSS will log an error and fail to start up. Request specifies a MasterKeyVersion that is not currently in use.  MOSS will log an event and return an error to the requestor. Positive tests  Tests will be verified by checking the response for the same nonce and a valid key after decryption.  Requests are HTTP POST commands.  The requests will be: 1 key, nonce = timestamp 1 key, nonce = 0 1 key, nonce = max value 2 keys, nonce = timestamp 2 keys, different MasterKeyVersions 1 valid key, 1 invalid key (wrong size, for instance) Negative tests The following tests will be considered malformed HTTP requests by MOSS.  This should never happen except for some type of hack attempt.  MOSS will return an HTTP status code of 404 and log an NT event with the IP and port of the requestor.  The requests will be: 0 keys specified maxint keys specified, attempt to send entire request 1 key, MasterKeyVersion set to invalid value (greater than 1?) 1 key, size of key set to 0 2 keys, size of one key set to 0 Valid 1 key, data sent is too short by 1 byte Valid 1 key, data sent is too long by 1 byte Send random data, random length Configuration Database Each individual setting will be tested as well as global behavior. CONFIGDB_SETTINGS: For each setting in the configuration database, the following three tests will be performed: Initialize   Using the management commands, verify that the setting matches what is in the configuration database after server has initialized.   Reconfigure   Using the management commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take effect (only applies to settings requiring a restart). Undo   Using the management commands, snapshot the current setting then update the database with a new setting.  Again using the management commands, verify that the setting has been tagged as needing a restart of the service to take affect.  Now change the setting back to the original value and using the management commands, verify that it is set back to the original value and does not require a restart of the service. Implementation note: Reconfigure and Undo can be consolidated into one test. MOSS Configuration Settings: Requires Restart [MOSS] UseNCipher=0(false) or 1(true, use the nCipher device implementation).  Default is 1. NumOfAllowServices=The number of service sections to read into the permitted table.  Default is 0. [SERVICE#]  (0..NumOfAllowServices instances permitted) AccountName=The account name that this service will run as.  This cannot be empty. PermittedKeyTypes=Comma delimited list of permitted key type decryption allowed for this server.  This should not be empty. CONFIGDB_NO_CONNECTION: No connection available to configuration server.  MOSS should raise an error and entering a polling loop, waiting for a response. Logging and Event Viewer Manually verify MOSS uses the app log correctly, and that all failures are properly logged in the event log.  This can be done using both the positive and negative tests above and manually verifying the MOSS logs. New Test Cases for M2 Milestone Existing Reusable Test Cases Stress Testing MOSS is used internally by server components requesting decryption of their respective keys.  The services make this request only upon startup.  Thus, performance should not be an issue.

Design Document – Xenon 68228

Author: 
Joseph Szymanski (josszy)
Outline:
This document will outline the design for the system necessary to implement the issue Xenon 68228, which seeks to automatically create partitions for SSAS databases.

Existing system explanation: 
The amount of data that we work with in OLAP cubes, in Sql Server 2005 Analysis Services (SSAS), grows far too fast to run analysis services upon the entire data set at once.  Individual measure group elements of an OLAP cube each have their own partitioning schema, used to select a subset of the data that the measure group draws from.
Consequently, to resolve the problem, relevant data to be analyzed is segregated by date (all data to be analyzed is date-indexed), and, based on a pre-defined periodicity, the data is separated into partitions.
Partitions are defined by a SQL query, which determines what subset of the larger database will be a member of this partition.
An example of such a query is: 
SELECT i_date, bi_user_puid, bi_machine_puid,
i_title_id, bi_offer_id, ti_country_id, dt_date
FROM v_olap_content_xbox1_fact WHERE
i_date>20050701 and i_date<20051001

In this case, we are taking records from v_olap_content_xbox1_fact after from July 1, 2005 and before October 1, 2005.
Finally, this partition is given a name. In the example above, the partition is named “Content_xbox1_2005_q3”. This name indicates the date and periodicity of the partitioning scheme.
This procedure is done manually, for each measure group. When new partitions are needed, which happens periodically, they are manually created.

Problems with the existing implementation (that this work item seeks to address):
This implementation has a number of different problems that require addressing:
Periodicity for partitioning varies both between and within measure groups. Some groups have changed their rate of partitioning, and each group has their own periodicity.
Manual effort is needed as often as twice a year (once per release) to generate new partitions for each measure group.
If, before a measure group partition is used, designers anticipate a different rate of input data and need to adjust the partitioning periodicity, this has to be implemented manually.
Since partition names are manually entered, without a defined schema, the only way to determine the periodicity of a partition is a human analysis of the name.
Since partition names are manually entered, without a defined schema, misspelling and other errors in entering their names can enter the system.
Periodicity of a partitioning scheme for a measure group can change with no record except for a different naming format. Even that new naming format lacks a rigid schema with which to determine its periodicity.
The lack of a defined schema prevents proper documentation of the rationale behind alterations to the periodicity of the partitioning scheme of a measure group.
Adding new partitioning periods (such as weekly) would consume an inordinate amount of work: 	
Manually checking each measure group to determine affected partitions
Scanning each partition that would be affected to assure it is empty
Deleting the affected partitions
Creating the new queries, manually, for each measure group and partition necessary.
Verifying that the partitions were created successfully, and that the queries correctly, and fully, differentiate the data . 
For example, if a partition is defined as “… WHERE i_date>20050701 and i_date<20051001”, and the next partition is defined as “WHERE
i_date>20051001 and i_date<20051201”, you are not analyzing the data for October  1, 2005 – one partition is including everything before that date, and the next, everything after that date. Forgetting to use >= in the next partition, or accidentally adding = to both the previous and next partitions, can cause either missing data or data overlaps.

Implementation of the Work Item:
The implantation of this work item will be a C# 2.0 CLI that will be called from a SQL Server 2005 scheduled task. It will be a program that is safe to run anytime, and will do the following:
Ensure that partitions for the next several months are defined. By default, this time period is three months, but the application will take a command-line parameter allowing the tool to create a different time period (at least one month).
Determine the current date, as indicated on the running computer’s system. 
Access a lookup table (t_measuregroup_partition_regexes) that enables the application to convert any partition name into a date (by converting the string pattern). 

An example of this is the “MultiplayerUsers” measure group that is currently in use. An example partition name therein is: MultiplayerUsers_2005_11. 

This table is how the user will be able to modify the partitioning scheme mid-stream; by changing the latest entry in the partition table, (or manually adding a new partition with the new periodicity), a change to the periodicity can be made. 
Generate the above mentioned lookup table, via the command line parameter “filltable”.


The table’s schema:

vc_ssas_dbname	varchar(50)		
The SSAS database name.
vc_cubename	varchar(50)			
The cube name.
vc_frequency_unit	varchar(50)		
Constrained to “’daily’, ‘weekly’, ‘monthly’, ‘semimonthly’, or ‘quarterly’”. The meaning of these frequency units is defined in the application. 
vc_partition_prefix	varchar(50)		
Provides a prefix to attach to each partition, as a descriptive name.
vc_query_def		varchar(2500)
The  SQL query that defines the partition
I_startdate		int
The starting date of the partition.
I_enddate		int
The ending date of the partition
vc_query_base_table	varchar(250)
This is an extremely important field. It determines the base table for which the partition queries. We use this to determine if a pre-existing table needs to be converted to use the reportarchivedb data source.

Here is a sample table for t_measuregroup_partition_regexes:


In the source code for the application, objects exist defining the periods ‘weekly’, ‘monthly’, ‘semimonthly’, ‘quarterly’, and ‘daily’. 
With this data, the program can use the command line argument <number of months> to determine how many partitions to create, and an internal C# algorithm (defined for monthly, semimonthly, and quarterly – the acceptable values of vc_frequency_unit) to determine how to name the partitions, connect to the database, and generate the partitions, when called upon.
For each server/cube combination in the database:
Access the cube in C#.
Enumerate the list of measure groups. 
Confirm that there are no differences – that there are no measure groups that exist in the table that do not exist in the database, and vice versa. Specifically, if a measure group exists on the database, and is not defined in the table, this needs to be handled as an error, except if the measure group has no date information – in which case not having a table entry is acceptable.
Convert each partition name into a date, and confirm that that date is either:
In the past, for legacy partitions
Within a date range as defined in the table.
If there is any failure, abort processing, and provide proper error logging, including an NT error event.

For each measure group partition, analyze its name (via a lookup table as explained earlier), and determine if it is in the future. If so, check to make sure that it is empty, and if empty and in the future, delete it. If it is not empty, but in the future, log this fact as non-fatal.
Via the command line parameter “cleanfuture”, for development and testing only, delete all partitions that are in the future.
For each partition whose end date is in the future,  look up the Partioning Type (part of the configuration we copied at startup), and using the partitioning type information, start dates, and end dates, programmatically instruct the SQL server to create the partitions via the query text provided.
For each partition whose end date is in the past, the overall goal is to change the query defining the partition to reference the reportarchivedb database, instead of the reportingdb database.
(This can also be done, without creating new partitions, by the command line parameter “archival”.)
 This is done by the following steps, run for each partition in the past:
Determine if the query, as exists, references the reportingdb database, and returns no results.
If this is the case, change the query to reference the reportarchive database, and see if it returns any results (select top 1 from <original query, against the reportarchive database).
If the reportingdb version has no results, and the reportarchivedb version does, alter the partition’s data source to reference the reportarchivedb database.
Log the results, error if necessary, and clean up connections, etc.

For the user of this tool, how do you change a partitioning type, mid stream?
First, you need to determine the beginning of the period for which you want to make the change. For example, if you want to change to quarterly, you need to make the change effective starting on the beginning of the quarterly period (1/1, 4/1, 7/1, 10/1). Otherwise, you will have a gap where you have no partition covering the date period before the beginning of the new frequency unit. 
 To make the change, alter all entries in the table t_measuregroup_partition_regexes , and change the vc_frequency_unit to the desired frequency, after the certain date.
An example SQL script to accomplish this:
update t_measuregroup_partition_regexes set vc_frequency_unit = 'quarterly' where vc_ssas_dbname = 'olaprdb' and vc_cubename = 'Usage'
 and vc_measuregroup = 'MultiplayerUsers' and i_startdate >= 20070401

This would change the MultiplayerUsers measure group, starting on 4/1/2007, to use the “querterly” partitioning type.



Note the following error/success codes for use in automating this tool:

CREATE_NEW_PARTITIONS_SUCCESS = 1 (Creating partitions succeeded)
FILLTABLE_SUCCESS = 2;		(Filling in the table worked)
CLEAN_FUTURE_PARTITIONS_SUCCESS = 3; (Deleted all future partitions worked)
ARCHIVE_OLD_PARTITIONS_SUCCESS = 4; (Archiving partitions worked)

Failure codes are the negative of the cooresponding success code.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Processes TitleProcesses Michael Courage Normal Michael Courage Microsoft Word 10.0b%MC%Challenge/Response overview This document contains a brief description of the challenge/response mechanism we use to detect modified Xboxes and pirated games, a set of processes and tools that will be required to deploy the feature, a list of policy questions and the beginnings of a plan to get the challenges going for launch. The mechanism The XSP protocol between XNet and the Security Gateway includes a Challenge/Response mechanism designed to detect piracy and modified Xboxes. The SG may include a challenge in a key exchange reply. If the reply contains a challenge, XNet must respond to the challenge in an XSP SECMSG before attempting to send any other traffic through the SG. Each challenge the SG may send has two configurable expressions associated with it. The expressions are evaluated given the response as a parameter. One expression determines if the response is interesting enough to be recorded in the SG s log file. The second determines whether or not the box should be immediately disconnected (kicked) from the service. These expressions are called the log expression and the kick expression. DVD challenges The DVD challenge is designed to detect piracy. Pirated copies of games do not generally include a full image of the original game disc. The DVD challenge takes advantage of this fact by challenge the client to prove that it has access to the image. The SG sends a block number and two offsets to the Xbox. The Xbox responds with two 20 byte buffers that contain a 20 byte hash value and 20 copied bytes from the DVD. The hash is a SHA1 hash of the block starting at the first offset and covering the remainder of the block. The copied bytes are copied from the second offset. The SG does not select challenges from the full available set. Instead it computes the index of the  current  challenge as a function of time elapsed since the generation of the challenge set. For each key exchange there is a 50% chance that the current challenge will be selected, and the other 50% is distributed evenly among previously used challenges. This means that we always have a new challenge available that pirates haven t seen before. It also means that we have to periodically harvest a new set of challenges so we can continue to advance the current challenge. Code challenges The code challenge is designed to detect modifications to the Xbox. The Security Gateway sends a small piece of signed code to the Xbox. The Xbox verifies the signature and runs the code. The code generates a 256 byte response buffer that is sent back to the SG. The SG selects challenges from the full set available. At some point we may want to update the code challenges to use a time-based scheme like the DVD challenges do so that we can always have fresh code challenges available. Processes Generating challenges DVD challenges DVD challenges will be generated automatically by a tool. For each DVD, the tool will generate a large set of random challenge parameters. It will then read the game DVD to determine the expected responses. Then it will generate a Security Gateway configuration file that contains the challenge set. When do we generate new challenges? When a new title goes live. When a new version of a title goes live. When we auto-update a title. Even though there is no new physical media the auto-updated title has a new version number, so the SG views it as a potentially different DVD with its own set of challenges. At some periodic interval. If we allow our challenge sets to get stale, then pirates will harvest all the challenges we might send. To reduce configuration churn on the SG we can refresh the challenge sets for all titles at once. To do this someone needs to keep a collection of every DVD that has a title that connects to Live. Code challenges Code challenges are partly written by hand and partly generated by tools. Many code challenges will be sent with a 16 byte parameter block that influences the response. This makes it harder for modified net stacks to keep a table of responses. We may also run tools that generate multiple obfuscated challenges from a hand built sources challenge. When do we generate new challenges? When we think of a way to detect mods that isn t covered by existing challenges. At some periodic interval we should generate new versions of parameterized challenges. Testing challenges In a test harness Running in a test harness allows us to check all challenges in a set. Since the SG assigns challenges randomly, it would be difficult to use the deployed SGs to test the full range of challenges. We can also use the harness to test against the full range of known kernels and hardware. On *Net, limited client set The SG has a feature that allows code challenges to be targeted at a specific set of clients. This allows us to do a controlled test in a more real-world environment that the test harness. On *Net, logging only The Kick and Log expressions can be set to FALSE and TRUE respectively to sanity check response data from the full range of clients that are hitting one of the networks. Storing challenges The challenge configuration files on the SG should be kept somewhat protected because they will contain the  answers  to all challenges. We can use the same protected configuration system that is used to store the site keys on the SG.  Deploying challenges on the SG As long as the number of configuration files is small, we can use xkeymgr.exe to install challenges. If we decide to keep challenges in a large number of separate files then we may want a new tool to do a bulk install. Storing & analyzing responses The SG generates text logs containing challenge responses. There are separate logs for DVD and Code challenges. A response is logged if either or both of the kick or log expressions evaluated to true. The log files generated by the challenges should be analyzed by a reporting tool that can provide a list of Xboxes that failed challenges, compute pass rates for each challenge, etc. It may also be useful to store response information in the UODB for each box so that we can see patterns of failure on particular machines. We may not want to Kick a box for certain types of failure cases, like if the Xbox reports an error while reading the DVD. However if a certain box always reports a DVD read error we want to know. Code challenges may uncover similar anomalous readings that are only interesting if additional responses are also out of expected ranges. Bad challenges If a bad challenge makes it to production we may suddenly see zillions of Xboxes unable to log on. The SG challenge configuration has a global on/off switch for exactly this situation. It may be that the problem is limited to a specific type of Xbox or a specific title or challenge (e.g. people with 4034 kernel can t sign on with Foo 2k3 20% of the time). We should make sure the log analysis tools are designed to detect this sort of pattern. Any code challenge can be disabled for a specific title if necessary. Tools DVD challenge generator From a DVD in the drive, the DVD challenge generator creates a set of DVD challenges and outputs them to a file in the format read by the security gateway. This would be easiest to do on a DevKit (because it s easy to retrieve the output), but the kernel needs to be modified to read retail discs. Code challenge signer The code challenge signer takes an executable image and generates a challenge file containing the digital signature for the challenge code followed by the code itself. Code challenge builder Given a challenge, we need to be able to generate a set of parameter/response pairs and an SG configuration file. The tool (or its output) will probably require some tweaking for each challenge because the responses may not be simple fixed numbers as with the DVD challenges. Challenge installer The challenge configuration files on the SG should be kept somewhat protected because they will contain the  answers  to all challenges. We can use the same protected configuration system that is used to store the site keys on the SG. As long as the number of configuration files is small, we can use xkeymgr.exe to install challenges. If we decide to keep challenges in a large number of separate files then we may want a new tool to do a bulk install. Test tools ll need a harness that can send sets of new challenges to titles in a non-random way so we can sanity check the results and determine the ranges of acceptable results. Reporting tool The log files generated by the challenges should be analyzed by a reporting tool that can provide a list of Xboxes that failed challenges, compute pass rates for each challenge, etc. Tools to add and query UODB information If we want to keep track of failures & other anomalies per-machine, we ll need to have tools to save away the data and get it out afterwards. Policy questions When should we Log? When should we Kick? When should we ban a box from the Live service? What do we tell people who get kicked or banned? Getting to Launch Goals Since the launch is close at hand we won t have time to make all the tools and other infrastructure that will eventually exist. However with some care we should be able to meet a couple of simple objectives. Avoid screwing up the experience of the vast majority that aren t running a mod chip There are three things that will make this go smoother. A limited scope for the initial code challenges, avoiding super aggressive challenges and of course lots of testing. Limiting the scope of the initial code challenge means less new code to test and more time to test it. What this means is that the response expressions that flag modded boxes should be somewhat lenient in cases where hardware or timing glitches will influence the response. Since the number of modified boxes in the service is likely to be a small percentage, the negative consequences of a test that produces false positives are likely to outweigh the result of a few modded systems slipping through. Of course there s no reason for mercy if we discover a clearly modified kernel. The number of titles, kernel versions and challenges isn t that large yet. We should be able to run through all of them at least once to make sure they work. Detect and lock out most or all modded systems for a limited time Even with a small number (like one or two) of code challenges we can probably detect all existing mods by examining the kernel code in main memory or in ROM and matching them against the set of all official kernels.  Things to do by week October 7 Refine the plan. Write ops documents describing challenge deployment and log handling during this ramp up period. Build DVD reading tool.  Build the code challenge. October 14 Deploy challenges on BetaNet and ProductionNet as soon as we can in log only mode. Deploy code challenge on TestNet & BetaNet and log all results. Test the code challenge against all of our kernels and as many real titles as we can. October 21 Build log analysis tools to find challenges that could cause trouble. Figure out expected ranges of response values. Test the challenge against all available kernels (including mods) and all currently enabled titles. October 28 Put challenges in production net targeted at our test machines. November 4 Send challenges to all boxes in production and log results. November 11 Throw switch to lock out modded boxes. Continue logging all responses. Things we need to get Retail & Beta Xboxes in every version. DVDs of all Retail & Beta games that are Live. Things to make Some level of automated test framework. The code challenge. The DVD challenge generator. A document that describes the challenge deployment process in more detail as well as what to do with the generated log files. Should include  emergency off-switch  instructions. Simple log analysis tool. Things to put off for now More sophisticated code challenges and tools to generate them. Longer term storage of response data. Detailed process document for updating challenges. Questions When will we get final bits for each of the launch titles? What kernel versions are available on Beta Xboxes? Are they the same set as we have in retail? Do we already have a process for denying an Xbox access to the service? Other stuff Things that would be nice to change in the SG The SG can release new DVD challenges every N minutes, but can t do so for code challenges. Adding this functionality for code challenges would make it harder for hackers to memorize the set of correct responses. The challenge logs don t contain records for boxes that did not respond to a challenge. It s possible that we could derive this information from other log files, but life would be easier if that wasn t necessary. Microsoft Confidential gd%zu gd%zu gd3u@ gd3u@ gdpEA gd&Rq

It expands on them by calling out specifics of what s new for each milestone. Functional cases are enumerated and stress (performance) testing methods are given that will be used to validate the cluster against release criteria.  In other words, II it isn t in here it isn t part of regression or stress runs that contribute to the decision by test to sign off. M1 Milestone The Presence and Notification in house (INH) server clusters are being combined into one stateful server cluster (PRESINH).   This cluster will provide backend support for the presence, teams and messaging services.   The Presence and Notification Front Doors (XPNFIIS) will continue to provide the same entry points for all of these services, so from the client perspective (Web and Xbox) these changes are transparent.   However, the changes being made to the backend are huge: A cluster of independent servers (NotiInh) and the internal protocol used to communicate to and between them is going away.   The new combined stateful backend (INH) server will support dynamic scalability via user migration. The stateless front door (IIS) server will be rewritten in C#. Configuration information will be loaded from the new configuration database instead of a local initialization file.   The XProfile database is going away, its contents merged into the UODB. The Monitoring server is also going away this release so the new presence cluster will have new means of recognizing dead Xboxes or SG. M2 Milestone Schedule The dates for these deliverables are set and managed by the release manager in conjunction with input from test management.  Deliverables for each milestone are:  M1 Milestone: Test Plan Complete -- 7/11/2004 Test plans written and updated for the current milestone.  Get test plans formally reviewed before  Test Functional Code Complete Test Functional Code Complete -- 7/30/2004 Test plan reviewed and functional test code written but not necessarily run against service yet. Test Stress Code Complete -- N/A There is no required stress testing for M1 Test Functional Test Complete   8/20/2004 Functional Test Complete passing percentage criteria for this milestone is 100% positive cases and 80%+ for negative test cases. Test Stress Complete -- N/A There is no required stress testing for M1 Test Complete   8/20/2004 Both the  Test Functional Test Complete  and  Test Stress Compete  criteria have been satisfied and all active bugs for the milestone have been closed and ready for signoff M2 Milestone Goals Fundamentally the intention of this document is to: Enumerate functional test cases for peer and dev review to ensure completeness and solid criteria for sign off. Describe stress testing enough to give a clear picture of what s expected of the servers for the same reason. Also each milestone may have specific goals. M1 Milestone The emphasis for this release will by to quickly identify problems caused by the vast changes being made to the internal working of the service. Take advantage of the fact that the external protocol is not changing to reuse and expand the large number of existing tests focused on it. Develop new methods and tests for validating proper use of the configuration database.  M2 Milestone Non-Goals This plan does not include the following for any milestone:  Validation of external tools or batch processes.  That is, anything not done in the context of processing requests in real time, with the exception of message expiration.  For example, team data expiration and reclamation. Testing of internal or in-cluster messages.   Client driven scenarios such as cross title message filtering or team invitations. Any explicit testing of services not provided by the presence cluster that make use of those services.  For example, competitions using messaging, stats using teams, etc.  (Though the shared test library will be made to support the simple use of presence, teams, or messaging when testing these other services.) Any testing of the alerts system or generation of alerts by the cluster.  (Though it will be a priority to provide shared test library support for creating situation that would cause a presence cluster generated alert.) Any testing of String server or Storage server to verify message properties that contain references to them. Any testing of other services that make use of the concept of teams, such as competitions, storage, stats, etc.  As testing progresses to final release, each milestone may also need to additionally specify what it will not include. M1 Milestone Testing directly to stateful (INH) servers.  This may be necessary later for testing of user migration but that question will not be resolved in the M1 timeframe. M2 Milestone:  Related Documents Messaging Service Implementation   Tsunami ($corext\private\doc\server\presence) Excellent details on how the messaging service works. Xbox Live Common Configuration Development Spec ($corext\private\doc\common\config) Details on how configuration database will work and be used. Detecting Offline Users and Xboxes ($corext\private\doc\server\presence) Discussion of reasons for eliminating the Monitoring server and how that might be done. Xenon DB Dev Spec Xenon DB Dev Spec ($corext\private\doc\sql) Discussion or database reorganization including merge of XProfile into UODB Server Consolidation (($corext\private\doc\common) Stateful Server Migration (($corext\private\doc\common) Not specific to how the merging of NotiInh or PresInh will be done, but as good as it gets for how user migration will work. There are no docs checked in concerning the teams or presence service interfaces or implementations. Functional Testing Summary Whenever possible, functional tests interact with only the front door.  The protocol to the INH servers in most cases is identical and messages are merely routed, but in some cases legacy messages are translated to newer versions at the front door so that is the only place they can be sent.   Also because the internal intra-server messaging is more fluid and not well documented, it became too difficult to keep up with.  All intra-server interaction is tested implicitly by use of the established external protocols that are established by client and web service API. Functional testing is divided into sections for each of the services the cluster supports.  Presence (and Notification), Teams, and Messaging.  All messages share a common header structure but are serviced via a URL and ports at the FD specific to each. General Overview The common header used for all messages to the FD (as well as other internal messages) is: struct BASE_MSG_HEADER     DWORD  dwMsgType;     DWORD  dwMsgLen;     DWORD dwSeqNum;     SGADDR sgaddr;     // BYTE rgbMsgData[ dwMsgLen ]; In addition to messages using the header above that travel to and between presence cluster servers on TCP connections there are messages with the SG via UDP to provide asynchronous notification of the results of certain requests made to the front door as well as notification of external events.   These are QVal messages and to the SG they are similar to SPI Auth/Data requests, except the purpose of them is to allow the SG to collect notification state and deliver It to the client via the heartbeat.   The QVal message is designed to be extremely flexible and self describing but it practice it s always the same:  It always contains the following QVals: QFlags   Signal to Dequeue notifications of types flagged. NewInvite   Signal to display in game that a new game invite has arrived. NewMsgIDs   ID of last 3 new messages. NewMsgData   Additional data for the last 3 new messages. DelMsgIDs   ID of last 3 deleted messages. When QVals are expected they are verified.  Also when QFlags indicate the need to dequeue that is done and verified. Messaging Service Specifics The message server is designed for flexibility and expansion.  For that reason there isn t a lot of enforcement of particular message semantics, or access restrictions on the server.  This is mostly left for the client API and/or other services to enforce. The basic information about a message is the message summary. struct Q_MESSAGE_SUMMARY     ULONGLONG qwSenderID;     ULONGLONG qwSenderContext;     MSGTIME   mtSentTime;     DWORD     dwMessageID;     DWORD     dwMessageFlags;     DWORD     dwSenderTitleID;     WORD      wExpireMinutes; // An offset in minutes from the sent time     WORD      cbDetails;     BYTE      bMessageType;     char      szSenderName[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE-1]; System messages have slightly different summary information. struct Q_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_SUMMARY     DWORD     dwTitleID;      ULONGLONG qwSenderContext;     FILETIME  ftSentTime;     DWORD     dwRegion;     DWORD     dwMessageID;     DWORD     dwMessageFlags;     WORD      wExpireMinutes; // An offset in minutes from the sent time     WORD      cbDetails;     BYTE      bMessageType;     char      szSenderName[XONLINE_GAMERTAG_SIZE-1];     char      szDescription[XMSG_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_DESCRIPTION_LEN]; Message details are more complicated. They are a free form collection of properties.  This is the header: typedef struct _XMSG_DETAILS     WORD wPropCount;     WORD cbData;     // This is redundant with cbDetails in Q_MESSAGE_SUMMARY     // XMSG_PROPERTY rgProperties[wPropCount]; // Property descriptors     // BYTE          rgbData[cbData];          // Property data } XMSG_DETAILS, *PXMSG_DETAILS; The definition of specific message property structures, constants, and macros is not included here because it is not necessary for the purpose of evaluating test case coverage for the messaging server.  To do so would be overly complicated and distracting.  It will be enough to note when a particular property is being set and verified.  In other words, for the most part details are a list of property structs and a blob of binary data. The messaging server doesn t care about what s inside the blob, though at least the existence of certain properties is sometimes checked.  However, test cases involving properties will make sure this data is not modified on its way through. typedef struct _XMSG_PROPERTY     WORD wPropTag; // This property's type and unique identifier     union     {         WORD wPropOffset; // The offset from the start of rgbData of this property's data         WORD wData;       // For type XONLINE_MSG_PROP_TYPE_I2 this contains the actual data         BYTE bData;       // For type XONLINE_MSG_PROP_TYPE_I1 and                            //   XONLINE_MSG_PROP_TYPE_BOOL this contains the actual data     }; } XMSG_PROPERTY, *PXMSG_PROPERTY; The message type establishes the purpose of the message and the properties that are required for a message of that type: Context Required Properties Title Custom Title defined Title defined Friend Request Game Invite See Flags Session ID Team Recruit Team ID Comp Reminder Comp Event ID Comp Name & Start Comp Request Comp Entity ID Comp Name, Start, & Close Live Message System Text Message Flags can be set or cleared, these are: #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_REQUIRED        0x00000001 // user is required to read this #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_RECOMMENDED     0x00000002 // user has a system recommended message #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_HAS_VOICE       0x00000004 // message contains a voice attachment #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_HAS_TEXT        0x00000008 // message contains a text body #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_READ            0x00000010 // message has been read #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_NON_EXPORTABLE  0x00000020 // only display on consoles, not web #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_TEAM_CONTEXT    0x00000040 // context refers to a team ID #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_COMP_CONTEXT    0x00000080 // context is comp event or entity ID #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_ALTERNATE_TITLE 0x00000100 // message is from an alt Title  #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_MARKETING       0x00000200 // Used on title-wide msgs to indicate                                                     //   opt-in settings should be checked #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_RESERVED 0xFF000000 // reserved for title custom messages // Flags valid in a call to send a message #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_VALID_SEND_MASK ( XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_RESERVED | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_NON_EXPORTABLE | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_REQUIRED | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_RECOMMENDED | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_HAS_VOICE | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_HAS_TEXT | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_TEAM_CONTEXT | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_COMP_CONTEXT )  // Flags a title is allowed to set on an already sent message #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_SETABLE   ( XONLINE_MSG_FLAG_READ | \                                             XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_RESERVED )  // Flags a title is allowed to clear on an already sent message #define XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_CLEARABLE         ( XONLINE_MSG_FLAGS_TITLE_RESERVED )  Finally, the Recipient Result (of send to an individual user) is: struct Q_RECIPIENT_RESULT     ULONGLONG qwUserID;     union // If send failed, this is the error code, if it succeeded this is the message ID     {         DWORD   dwMessageID;          HRESULT hrRecipient;     }; Team s Service Specifics The following structures are used by various messages in the protocol.

Rather than list those cases here they are listed with existing cases for clarity. Configuration Changes Configuration database values will be changed and their effects verified.  Cases are divided into sections based on the server (front door or stateful backend) being controlled.  Each case will cover one value and indicate what action needs to be taken to get the value to   as well as how that change will be verified.  In some case this will involve manual manipulation and examination.

In addition to this specific cases will test the basic functionality. A test tool will be developed to create a set of active users whose stateful server location is known.  XMgmnt commands will be need to be added to validate the current state and hashing of a user to verify before, during and after conditions for each of the following cases. Server added   User logs off and comes back comes back moved  Server added   User does not log off and is eventually forced to move. Server removed   User logs off and comes back moved Server removed   User does not log off and is eventually forced to move  More TBD Existing Reusable Test Cases There are no additions to the protocol for this release.  Existing cases focus on the exercise of each message in the protocol which is identified by its unique ID.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Challenge/Response configuration TitleChallenge/Response configuration Michael Courage Normal Michael Courage Microsoft Word 10.0Challenge/Response configuration This document describes procedures for installing, removing, updating, activating or deactivating code challenges on the Security Gateway. Enabling challenges The Security Gateway will not issue challenges to clients unless you enable challenges. This step has to happen before challenges are added (or removed), because the SG will not accept other challenge configuration if challenges are disabled. Add the following line to D:\sgroot\sgconfig.ini: EnableChallengeResponse 1. Run the management command e :sg configure_string  EnableChallengeResponse 1 Disabling all challenges The gateway will not send any challenges when challenges are disabled. Also, the gateway will not accept any challenge configuration (except a command to enable challenges) when challenges are disabled. Remove the EnableChallengeResponse line from D:\sgroot\sgconfig.ini. Run the management command e :sg configure_string  EnableChallengeResponse 0 Installing challenges Each code challenge will be provided in a cleartext INI file. Each challenge has an ID number, N. The file that contains the challenge will be sg_chal_N.ini. These files should be stored and backed up to secure locations as they will contain information required to defeat the challenge mechanism.  The following instructions should be followed on every SG in the datacenter. (I know this is redundant, but it s to make sure someone doesn t skip read it) Challenges must be enabled before installing challenges. Copy the file sg_chal_N.ini to all SGs on site one (site two will not run challenges) and open a command window on each machine. In these cmd windows, run xkeymgr protect sg_chal_N.ini D:\sgcfg\sg_chal_N.cfg to generate protected versions of the files. You can should then delete all the sg_chal_N.ini files that you have already incrypted. Make the SG accept the new challenge in sg_chal_N.cfg by running the management command e :sg configure_file_secure D:\sgcfg\sg_chal_N.cfg. Removing challenges Challenges must be enabled when removing challenges. Delete the file D:\sgcfg\sg_chal_N.cfg. Run the management command e :sg configure_string  CodeChallenge { Id N } Where N is the number of the challenge you wish to remove.  This will only disable the one challenge.  Once a challenge is disabled in this way, it can not be re-enabled.  It must be reinstalled by following the instructions under Installing Challenges. Log processing The challenges will generate logs in the D:\sglog directory with the prefix SGCHALCODE. These logs should be gathered from the SGs for analysis, but they should not be put up on the share with all the other text logs as they contain information that could be used to bypass the challenges.

Microsoft Office Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corporation Detecting Offline Users and Xboxes TitleDetecting Offline Users and Xboxes Brian Morin Normal.dot Peter Hansen Microsoft Office WordbjbjqPqP Detecting Offline Users and Xboxes Current Design  SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT  All Xboxes maintain a stream of heartbeats (aka pulses) to and from the SG to maintain connectivity.  When an Xbox stops sending heartbeats for several seconds, the SG declares the box dead and sends a XMSP_MSG_DEADXBOX message saying so to both Monitoring Servers.  Each Monitoring server then rebroadcasts that message out to all Presence (PMSG_DEAD_XBOX message), Notification (QMSG_DEAD_XBOX message) and Matchmaking (XMATCH_DEAD_XBOX message) servers.  Each of these messages includes only the SGADDR of the Xbox that has gone offline in addition to metadata (length, type, etc.) In addition, there is a heartbeat maintained from the each SG to the Monitoring servers (XMSP_MSG_SG2MSHEARTBEAT) and from the Monitoring servers to each SG (XMSP_MSG_SG2MSHEARTBEAT).  When an SG stops sending heartbeats for several seconds, the Monitoring server declares the SG dead and broadcasts this information out to all Presence (PMSG_DEAD_SG message), Notification (QMSG_DEAD_SG message) and Matchmaking (XMATCH_DEAD_SG message) servers. Problems Server Cost The monitoring servers were originally envisioned as a service that monitored the health of all xbox live services. Ultimately, this vision was not realized, and the monitoring servers have remained as solely a dead xbox forwarding service. Since this cluster requires redundancy, there are 2 monitoring servers in all production level networks, and a single server in each of the other environments, meaning a total of about 10 monitoring servers across all environments. These servers cost money to purchase, currently about $5000 each, and require operations personnel to monitor the servers.  As we look forward to Xenon, the Live team is looking at replacing all servers in all environments with new hardware over the next few years. Reducing the total number of servers will result in a significant savings in operating budget. It also results in a simpler environment to operate and monitor for ops.  The monitoring servers are currently under-utilized in every respect, which is why they are considered a candidate for removal from the service. This is the driving reason for performing this work at this time. DeadXbox messages are sometimes dropped Due to network conditions, failed servers, load, etc.  We should expect a small percentage of all DeadXbox messages sent to not reach their final destination.  Since SGs can stay in service for several days, waiting for a DeadSG message to clean these sessions up is not practical.  Matchmaking handles this by timing out sessions. Presence has no mechanism to recover from this situation, and will only clear up the user once they log on again.  Two monitoring server does not mean there is a not a single point of failure There still are several ways to bring down the entire monitoring system despite having two servers.  Both use the same configuration file that could be incorrect.  Both have the same software which could fault at the same time.  Perhaps other failures as well depending on network and hardware configuration. Broadcasting DeadXbox messages (twice) does not scale At 50,000 concurrent Xboxes, with 5 minutes between logons (due to soft reboots between XBEs) the monitoring service will generate 333 DeadXbox messages per second.  As we grow as a service this number will increase, putting an increasing burden on all Presence, Notification and Matchmaking servers. Restarting an SG can cause the first few new Xboxes on the SG to be declared dead There is several seconds of latency between the SG going offline, the Monitoring service detecting it and the DeadSG message being sent.  Within that window it is possible for the SG to be restarted and start accepting new Xboxes before the services (particularly Presence and Notification) receive the DeadSG message.  As a result, the Xboxes/users that got onto the restarted SG within that window will caught by the DeadSG message.  This accidentally happened on BetaNet by restarting the user-mode part of the SG. Alternate Detection of Dead Xboxes in Presence and Notification Presence and notification need an alternate way to expire user sessions when DeadXbox messages fail to arrive for the user. Notification Service For the notification service, we can leverage the QFlags mechanism we already have built for Notification to SG communication to do this. Currently, the notification service sends a SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_LAZY or SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_PUSH message to the SG when it has a changed QValue to send to the SG.  For example, when the first notification of a given type arrives.  The SG then responds with a SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_REP message acknowledging receipt of the QVals.  Part of this acknowledgement is two boolean values,  _fNotFound and _fNoSuchUser.  _fNotFound is set if the Xbox was not found.  _fNoSuchUser is set if the user was not found.  The notification server expiries the user/Xbox if either of these flags are set. It would be a simple modification for the Notification server to resend the current set of QVals if they have not been sent for several minutes.  The Notification server then could check the reply to determine if the user and xbox is still online.  This would add a minimal amount of extra traffic and avoid any arbitrary expiration of users or queue items based on a timeout. A further enhancement would be to timing out users (or Xboxes or perhaps even the entire SG) if the SG fails to reply to a SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_LAZY or SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_PUSH message within a given number of retries. Presence Service To avoid arbitrarily expiring users, the Presence server should also query the SG for the status of idle users.  The Presence server can do this by sending a SGMSG_TYPE_SET_QVALS_LAZY message with 0 QVals for these idle users.  This operation will NOP on the SG, but return the status of the requested user and SG.  If there is no answer, the Presence server can retry until it assumes the SG is out of service and then times out the user. Matchmaking Matchmaking will continue to expire session naturally as it always has been designed to do. As a result of this work, we may want to make the expiration of match sessions more aggressive than it already is to ensure there are a minimum number of dead sessions in match.  Better Routing of DeadXbox Messages Broadcasting DeadXbox messages twice to every presence, notification and matchmaking server does not scale.  Projecting out even further it is questionable if a redundant pair of monitoring servers could handle all of the load generated by spikes of Xboxes going offline.  There are three changes we could make to fix these problems. First, have the SGs send DeadXbox messages to the Front Doors directly, instead of via the monitoring servers.  The SGs would have to be configured with both Front Door VIPs (they already have the P&N Front Door VIP for state changes.)  Also, the P&N Front Door would have to add support for broadcasting DeadXbox messages.  This would immediately reduce the number of DeadXbox messages received by their destination servers in half and eliminate the monitoring service as a point a failure for their delivery. Second, include the user PUIDs of the users on the Xbox and TitleId they were in when sending DeadXbox messages.  This data is already tracked by the SG within the authentication ticket.  This would allow the front doors to only send these messages to servers interested in them, further reducing the load. To reduce network traffic, the Monitoring server did some batching of dead xbox messages before sending them to matchmaking. With the new implementation, dead xbox messages will be batched together for both presence and matchmaking, in the same manner that the SG currently batches State messages for presence.  Do We Need a Monitoring Service? If SGs send DeadXbox messages directly to the Front Doors, then all that is left for the monitoring service to do is send DeadSG messages.  So, do we even need them for this functionality? The SGs could send their own DeadSG message before they are gracefully shutdown, and perhaps send another DeaadSG a few seconds before they accept new connections.  This would provide some immediate cleanup of offline users.  Then remove the monitoring service and with it the window where new online users are killed with the late DeadSG message.   For cases this does not cover we can rely on the individual services to eventually expire users on a failed SG, which we needed to have anyway. Since this case should be extremely rare, allowing the users to timeout from presence and matchmaking naturally should not pose any serious performance problems for the service. Proposal Priority 0 Work Items Add User PUIDs and TitleID to DeadXBox messages By doing this work now, we eliminate the need to change intra-service protocols at a later date when we need to leverage this information to scale out. Implement dead user detection in the Notification Server Reply QVal messages to the SG for idle users to determine if they are online.  If there is no response after a number of retries, cleanup the user. Implement dead user detection in the Presence Server Send empty QVal messages to the SG for idle users to determine if they are online.  If there is no response after a number of retries, cleanup the user. Note: Merging the presence and notification services into a single NT service will mean that only the notification version of these changes is required, as the user record and maintenance will be shared.  Have the Presence and Notification Front Door process Dead Xbox Messages Move this message to the Front Door, eliminates the need for the monitoring service to know the address of every Presence and Notification server and allows the front door to use existing code to route the messages to the interested servers. Have the SGs send DeadXbox messages directly to the P&N and Match Front Doors. At this point the Monitoring Service is just a big relay that doubles the traffic.  Cut out the relay by sending the messages directly.  Will reduce the amount of DeadXbox messages generated in half. Remove the Monitoring Service No longer used Priority 1 Work Items Have the matchmaking front door use PUIDs and/or TitleID to route DeadXBox messages Helps the Matchmaking service scale with the service. Priority 2 Work Items Have the SGs send their own DeadSG messages when they are gracefully brought offline. Speed up detection of dead users in some cases.

Please see   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online/Specs/Messaging.doc"  http://sts/xbox_online/Specs/Messaging.doc  for a feature-level description of Messaging and   HYPERLINK "http://sts/xbox_online"  http://sts/xbox_online  for the client-side spec. Architecture Diagram  SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT  Design Conceptual Components Messages Messages are divided into three basic pieces.  First, there is a message summary which contains a common set of properties found on all messages that are used to make initial decisions about the routing and display of the message to the user.  Next, there are 4096 bytes of message details made up of any properties applicable to the particular message type, that should be retrieved when the user opens the message.  Finally, a message may have attachments which are represented as URLs from the Storage service and stored as properties in the message details. In the implementation, messages are divided into two types, persistent and transient.  Persistent messages are messages that have a lifetime generally greater than one day and are stored in the Profile store.  Transient messages are messages with a shorter lifetime and are stored in memory on the Notification server.  Currently only Game Invites are transient messages. All messages have an expiration which has a maximum value of 45 days.  A default expiration for each message type can be set in the xpnconfig.ini file on the Notification server(s).  A client requests the default expiration by passing zero when sending a message. Message Properties Message properties are the smallest unit of data on a message.  Each property is given a unique ID and a type which defines the property s contents.  The type and ID together form a property tag which is used when setting and retrieving the property.  The client code is written such that the binary format of properties is never exposed to titles, and titles are required to request the properties they are interested in off of a message rather than being able to see all properties on a message.  This is done so that a particular message that a title is familiar with handling does not break that title if new properties are added to the message type in the future. Message Types Messages are given a type which acts as a contract that informs the client how the message should be handled, what required properties should be expected, and how the sender context field should be interpreted. User Message Queue The user message queue contains the messages for an individual user and is limited to 100 persistent messages and 25 transient messages.  There are APIs that allow a user to enumerate and delete from this list, as well as for sending new messages to the queues of other users.  The user message queue is a merging of the persistent messages for a user stored in the Profile store, and the transient messages for a user stored in memory on the Notification server.  Global Message Queue The global message queue contains messages that are destined for all users on the system, all users of a specific title, or all users of a specific region.  This is where both system messages and publisher-sent title messages are stored.  Messages in this queue can be flagged as required, which means that a user is prevented from further activity on the service until they read them, or as recommended, meaning that a user should be warned of their existence when they logon, but allowed to proceed.  When a user logs on, the global message queue is checked for messages applicable to the user, and if any are found they are copied into the user message queue.  The time of the last retrieval from the queue is stored so that the same messages are not re-retrieved at the next logon.   This queue is persisted in the Profile store, and there are APIs for enumerating, sending, and deleting messages from it.  A global message can be set to expire on a specific date similar to normal messages in the user message queue, and this expiration will be copied to the user queue for any users that receive it.   This could be used to send a message of the day or week, which is then set to expire at the end of the specified time period after which it is no longer applicable.  Messages in the global queue can also have a sent time dated in the future, such that the message is not delivered to any users before a specified point in time.  This allows a publisher to send a message to be delivered at a specified time without having to  sit at the send button  at that time. Owned Title List This list contains the titles a user has logged on with in the past, and is used to prevent a user from receiving publisher-sent messages from titles they don't own.  There is an API for enumerating the list so that the Dash/Lounge/Web can allow the user to manage the titles they want to receive publisher messages from.  There is also an API to allow the user to delete from this list, which might be used when a user has rented and returned a title and no longer wishes to receive publisher-sent messages related to it.  The owned-title list is persisted in the Profile store.  Notification Server The Notification server handles all Messaging requests.  Transient messages are stored in memory on the Notification server, and the Notification server is responsible for sending QVals on the SG heartbeat when a message is added or deleted from a user's queue.  The Notification server also remains responsible for sending V1 QFlags and a QVal for Friend Game Invites in order to keep existing titles working properly. SG Heartbeat Notification Notifications are sent to Xbox clients using the SG heartbeat mechanism using structures called QVals.  QVals contain a sequence number and up to three DWORDs of associated data.  Messaging uses three new QVals, two are used when messages are added, the first contains the message IDs of the 3 most recently added messages, and the second contains additional data about the 3 most recently added messages.  A third QVal is used when a message is deleted and contains the message ID of the 3 most recently deleted messages.  The client can look at the sequence number on the QVal and compare it against the last seen sequence number to determine if it has the message IDs for each notification that has occurred for that QVal.  If the client has missed three notifications, it will have to use the Messaging APIs to enumerate all messages for the user.  If the client is keeping up with notifications, it can enumerate only once at logon and then use the message IDs in the notifications to keep its stored list of messages up to date. Front Door The Messaging front door shares the existing Presence and Notification front door, adding new commands as noted below Messaging Operations Initialization/Logon Each time a user logs on, the owned title list is first checked to see if the current title is new and should be added to the list.  Then, the title ID and title region being logged in with are used to copy appropriate messages from the global message queue into the user message queue.  Since this only occurs at logon, a user will not receive new system, title, or region messages sent after the user logs on until the user logs off and back on again. Message Enumeration When a client attempts to retrieve messages for the first time, they will request a list containing the summary for all of the messages in a user s queue.  The client will then cache this information, and begin listening to notifications to keep the local list up to date when messages are added and deleted.  If the client misses too many notifications due to packet loss or more than three messages arriving during one heartbeat interval, the client can always re-enumerate to get the full message list.  Message lists are returned to the client sorted from newest to oldest by sent time.  The data returned in an enumeration is kept small in order to make enumerating a very efficient means of finding out enough information about all available messages to make routing and UI decisions about where to display new message icons and display enough summary information to the user so that the user can decide whether the message is one they want to open and read in more detail.  The message summary data returned in an enumeration is 58 bytes, and since the user can have a maximum of 125 message, the maximum amount of data returned by an enumeration is 7,250 bytes. Message Retrieval Message retrieval is used to get the details of a message, and requires knowing the user PUID and message ID of the message of interest.  A client is expected to have first obtained the message ID by enumerating messages, receiving a new message notification, or receiving the message ID from another Live service.  This operation will return both the 58 byte message summary as well as the up to 4096 byte details of the message.  Any attachments that are stored in the Storage service will be represented as Storage URLs in the message details.  Attachment retrieval is separated from message retrieval because attachments can potentially be very large and should require additional user interaction prior to downloading them.  For example, if an attachment were a 5MB map, the user might be required to select  Save Map  before the map would actually be downloaded to the client Xbox console. Attachment Retrieval Properties over a certain threshold are stored on the Storage server as attachments, and are represented as Storage URLs in the message details.  These properties could contain things like a large map, armor, or a ghost race and are not retrieved along with other message details until the client explicitly requests for them to be retrieved.  Storage APIs outside of Messaging are used for storing and retrieving attachments and will not be covered here.  Once the Storage URL is retrieved from Messaging, it is up to the client to call the appropriate APIs to download the attachment.  Message Deletion A message may be deleted in several different ways: explicit deletion by a title/user/service, message expiration, and full user queue handling (see below).  Messages will not be deleted automatically upon being viewed.  Messages may be explicitly deleted by a service such as Presence deleting game invites when the sending user logs off, or the Tournament service deleting messages related to a cancelled tournament.  A user may also explicitly delete messages from their own queue. Message Sending When a client wants to send a message, it builds up the required properties for the type of message being sent, and then builds a list of PUIDs the message will be sent to, which may be up to 100 users.  The Messaging service does not validate one user's rights to send to another user, this is expected to be controlled by client policy.  If any attachments are to be stored in external storage, the client will first store those properties using the Storage service APIs, and then pass the Storage URL as a part of the properties it is building up for the message.  For title-custom messages, the title is allowed to specify the expiration for the message up to 45 days.  The message is then passed to the server for sending to the specified list of recipients.  The server will set certain properties on the message at the time of receipt, such as the sent time and deliver the message to the specified recipients. Message Revocation A message sender is allowed to revoke any message that they send.  The revoke API accepts parameters that are very similar to the reply returned from the send API, so that any client or service sending messages can easily store the send reply if they later anticipate needing to revoke the message.  The revoke API accepts the same limit of 100 recipients in one call that the send API does. Message Blocking When a user deletes a message they have the option of blocking the sender of that message from sending them messages in the future.  A user may unblock a user that they have previously blocked by sending that user any message.  When a message is sent to a user that has blocked the sender a special error code is returned to the client which may or may not be displayed to the user depending on client policy. A user can stop receiving messages from a particular publisher by deleting the particular title from the owned title list, and not playing that title again.  If the user does logon with the title again, it will be added back to the owned title list and the user will again receive messages related to tha
