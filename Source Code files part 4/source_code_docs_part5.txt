s are required by the OS kernel.  These functions are the EFI Run Time Services.  The OS loader must pass the SystemTable to the OS kernel, so the OS kernel can make the Run Time Service calls.  The exact mechanism used to transition from the OS loader to the OS kernel is implementation dependent.  It is important to note that the OS loader could transition to the OS kernel prior to calling ExitBootServices().  In this case, the OS kernel is responsible for calling ExitBootServices() before taking full control of the system.

Exqueue   this dumps the executive work queues and gives a little diagnosis on what might be stalled Defwrites   dumps the cache manager delayed write queue and also does some diagnosis Findata [fileobject] [offset] dumps the cache manager view of the data for a file at the given offset. Irpfind [Flags] [RestartAddress] [Field] [Match]  Searches pool for irps. The flags are the same as for poolfind. Note: irps only exist in non-paged or special pool. RestartAddress lets you pickup a search from a given point. The field and match parameters let you filter for only the IRPs with a matching event, device, thread, process in its MDL, file object or argument. Locks   dumps a resource. Note: ed nt!expresourcetimeoutcount to increase the timeout value. Lpc [message] traces from an LPC message to the server thread handling it Pcr [processor #] dumps the processor info per processor. This includes the DPC list remaining to be delivered. PoolUsed [flags]   dumps pool usage if pool tagging is on. The flags determine sort order flags = 2 is sort by nonpaged pool flags = 4 sort by paged pool.  Flags = 1 puts it in verbose mode. Poolfind [Tag] [Flag]  searches pool for a given tag the flag determines which type of pool to look in.    0 = NonPagedPool 1= PagedPool 2=SpecialPool Thread / Process dump the process or thread  !process 8 f  will dump the complete system process threads  dumps the virtual memory situation. Pay special attention to pool usage counts. In ntfskd.dll Extents [attribute address]   given the address of an attribute dumps the extent pairs. Cachedrecords   dumps all the threads with cached mft records.  dump syscache data. This is only useful when building syscache privates and dumps the logging info attached to an SCB in a readable form. Filerecord [fcb] given an fcb dumps the on disk record if cached. Ntfsdata   dumps the top level ntfsdata including all the VCBs Overflow [vcb] dumps the overflow queue for a given VCB Notes:  Critical Section timeouts To trace get the stack at the point of fault using !cxr/!kb. Then dump the critical section it s the 1st parameter to RtlpWaitForCriticalSection.    The owner thread id is the 4th DWORD in the critical section.  Alternatively the possible timeouts printouts also show the critical section location and owner. This is a good shortcut and if they re missing just press   and let another timeout occur. RTL: Re-Waiting RTL: Enter Critical Section Timeout (2 minutes) 0 RTL: Pid.Tid e0.100, owner tid 344 Critical Section 77FC5060 - ContentionCount = Then do a !process to find the thread with the TID. Do a !thread and then usually the thread is waiting for a mutant or on a LPC message. If its waiting for a mutant the owner thread will be printed out in the header by !thread and if its in an lpc wait use the !lpc extension. Hung IRPs Once you ve found a stack waiting in NtfsWaitSync find the original irp. It s the 2nd parameter to NtfsNonCachedIo. If the IRP is in storage stack great o.w it s been subdivided into multiple sub-irps. To find the sub-IRPS  you could do a !irpfind but its much quicker to disassemble NtfsNonCachedIo , find the IORUNS parameter passed into NtfsMultipeAsyncIo and dump the IORUNS using !irp on each subirp.  At this point, check the other processors to see if someone is blocking DPC delivery.  If so you re done see what the current thread on that processor is doing. If not, put a breakpoint on the ntfs completion routine, press   and confirm that we re not being called. If the irp is still hung  you can then forward to ntmsd.  Note: if its in scsiport it may be useful to do a !scsikd.scsiext [scsi deviceobject from the IRP]  Pending IRPS  If an IRP has been pending by us, it must then be in one of several queues including: the overflow queue in the vcb (!overflow) the deferred write queue (!defwrites) or the system work queues (!exqueue) Hung PageIns: The 5th parameter to MiWaitForInPageComplete is a PMMINPAGE_SUPPORT structure. First check the thread parameter to see which thread is doing the i/o.  Also the information  field in the iosb should contain the actual read irp.

This is a test filter that is based on Sfilter.

It was written to test the IO verifier check to make sure that a file doesn't try to 
reissue a create with a file object that has already been opened and closed by
the base file system.


This filter attaches two device objects to each volume stack, Upper and Lower.

When a CREATE is seen on a file with the name '\test\failure.txt' with no share access, 
 * Upper and lower will pass it through to the base file system, 
 * Once the file system has opened the file, Lower will cancel the create by calling 
   IoCancelFileOpen and returning STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL.  
 * When Upper gets STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL, it will change the ShareAccess for this create 
   to FILE_SHARE_READ then reissue the CREATE irp.

       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : FileSpy
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this FileSpy application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your FileSpy application.

FileSpy.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

FileSpy.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CFileSpyApp application class.

FileSpy.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CFileSpyApp.

FileSpy.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Visual C++.

FileSpy.clw
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.

res\FileSpy.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file FileSpy.rc.

res\FileSpy.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 
	Visual C++.  You should place all resources not editable by
	the resource editor in this file.



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For the main frame window:

MainFrm.h, MainFrm.cpp
    These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from
    CFrameWnd and controls all SDI frame features.

res\Toolbar.bmp
    This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar.
    The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the CMainFrame
    class. Edit this toolbar bitmap using the resource editor, and
    update the IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR array in FileSpy.rc to add
    toolbar buttons.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one document type and one view:

FileSpyDoc.h, FileSpyDoc.cpp - the document
    These files contain your CFileSpyDoc class.  Edit these files to
    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading
    (via CFileSpyDoc::Serialize).

FileSpyView.h, FileSpyView.cpp - the view of the document
    These files contain your CFileSpyView class.
    CFileSpyView objects are used to view CFileSpyDoc objects.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Help Support:

hlp\FileSpy.hpj
    This file is the Help Project file used by the Help compiler to create
    your application's Help file.

hlp\*.bmp
    These are bitmap files required by the standard Help file topics for
    Microsoft Foundation Class Library standard commands.

hlp\*.rtf
    This file contains the standard help topics for standard MFC
    commands and screen objects.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named FileSpy.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is 
in a language other than the operating system's current language, you
will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC42XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC42DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\fs\lfs\lfsques.txt ===
What is the structure of a transaction ID.  This is generated by the client
(or transaction manager) and is passed through to the disk by Lfs.

Can't store the next Lsn in a log record header because its exact location
may not be known when a log record is being written (in-memory) or a
page block is being written to disk.  This is because the write to disk
may occur before the next log record is received and there is no way to
know if it will fit in the remaining part of the file or will wrap and
be written to the beginning of the file.

Log records that require multi-page allocation blocks will begin at the
beginning of a page block.  Then the fields which describe the data shift
can be in a page header record and not a log record header.

We restrict the data size of a log record to 32 bits.

Log record types:  We have an enumerated type for all log record, not
a main type and subtypes.  i.e. all commit protocol records are defined
at the top level.

Multi-page blocks:  Page headers indicate whether they are the first
or last page.  During Lfs restart these pages may be walked through.
As far as the analysis algorithm goes, these can be thought of as a
single unit.  All page(s) must be found or this will be considered
a bad page(s), the next page then must be read to discover if this is
a fatal error or the point where the system crashed.

Looking up multipage via Lsn:  Given Lsn pin appropriate page and look
at log record.  If single page then done.  Otherwise, unpin page and
pin multiple pages.

For what operations do we need to check the update sequence array in
the page headers.

Log file header prior to restart areas.  This will be a single system page
and contain the log file base values which will allow both copies of the
restart area to be found.  This information will be duplicated in the restart
areas so that if the sector containing the file header goes bad, an
intelligent choice can be made for where to search for the first Lfs
restart area.  (Or we could duplicate it in the first x sectors).

Should we checksum the log file header.

Added client Id to the log record header.

Is it reasonable to use a USHORT to index into the client array and a USHORT
for the client sequence number.

Do we even need a sequence number.  Will the index number be sufficient to
walk forward through the log records.  When will the index be reused, only
when a client closes his loghandle.  In that case it will be impossible to
start searching from an out of date Lsn.

Change InitializeReadContext to LfsContextReadFirst and return the first Lsn.
Read Next is LfsContextReadNext.

May not need the LfsPreviousLsn in the log record header.

Log record enumeration.  Walking forwards, client will probably run
out unexpectedly.

Log record enumeration.  Walking backwards, take Lsn, determine Log page
boundary.  Pin log page, if multiple pages unpin and repin multiple pages.

Walking backwards, how likely are we to want to stay in the same log
page for several records.

Enumerating.  It is possible we are pinning pages for read and may be trying
to write them at the same time.

If we have a page pinned multiple times, will that prevent it from being
flushed with a ccflush call.

Will a client want to look at several log records at once, or only one
at a time.  The current interface supports only one at a time.

LOG CONTEXT BLOCK

        No synchronization of access to the log context block.  Client
        shares the block at his own risk.

        How to resolve that enumeration may pin (for a while) a block of
        pages that are trying to be flushed.

        Enumeration (in the forward direction) may be trying to read a lsn
        as it is being written.  Solution, write the log record before updating
        the last Lsn in the page header.

        This may make the LastLsn number in the context block obsolete as it
        may be outdated.  However, any later Lsn's wouldn't have existed when
        the client started this call.  Should we hide all new log records
        from him.

Log file.  How big may it be (ULONG, LARGE_INT)

Log buffer control block.  Access via global spinlock.  Sets up frame for
next write and then releases it.  Count is kept in block of active writers,
can't be flushed until active count is zero.  Does this make sense, how
do we wait until active count is zero.

Lsn should be 96 bits.  64 bit file offset and 32 bit sequence value.
The interface with the Lfs provides that the address of this structure
be passed.

Is it expensive to allocate and deallocate an event each time a new buffer
is used.

Can the restart areas offset safely be a ULONG.

How can log service initiate a sector revectoring.

Start log file sequence number at 1, then 0 indicates we have just wrapped.

Since write operations to the log file must be serialized, there is no
reason not to let the worker thread perform all the writes.

Operations:

    Given an Lsn:

        Find the next Lsn
        Find the previous client Lsn
        Find the client undo next lsn.

    Given a log record.

        Find the client owner of the record
        Find the transaction ID for the record

    Log context blocks

        Allocate and deallocate
        Write into the fields.
        Determine if the next/prev Lsn resides in the same block of pages.
        Pin and unpin pages in the log file.
        Allocate and deallocate the user's buffer.
        Synchronize access to the context block (is this needed)

    Log client area

        Allocate and deallocate
        Verify the client as valid.

    Log buffer control blocks

        Allocate and deallocate
        Link into control block list for a particular log file.
        Allocate and deallocate buffer associated with control block.
        Determine the size required for the buffer.
        Determine where buffer fits in log file.
        Determine where the next log record should be in the buffer.
        Determine when all the authorized writes to the file have completed.
        Syncronize access to the fields of the contol block.

How do we store the update sequence stride on disk to read on a different
system??

What do we do when there is an I/O error writing to the disk??  How does
an operation know that a previous I/O error has occurred??

Do multiple clients open the same log file with the same file object or
the same file??  (We could always check if the context pointers match)

How do we disable the update sequence mechanics in order to originally
recognize the log file.

WMI LOGGING
-----------

I. To start logging 
 a. for Mup.sys and Dfs.sys
     use the tracelog program.
     for example:     
	tracelog -start <SessionName> -f <logFile> -guid <control guid file> -level <level> -flags <flags>
     the flags need to be given in decimal form, not hex.
     You can start multiple logger session at one time or you can log multiple components at once by including 
     multiple contols guids in the control guid file.
 b. for dfssvc.exe
     dfssvc logging is contoled by registry settings
     To enable logging in this component set the following keys under
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Tracing\DFS Service\
     Active=1
     Level = <level>
     ControlFlags = <flags> 
     LogFileName = <logFile>
II. Stop logging
     Before looking at the logs, you should stop the log session.
	tracelog -stop <SessionName>
III. Dumping the logs
     use tracedmp (soemtimes found as tracefmt)
	tracedmp -f <logFile> -guid <mof file> -o <outputfile>
IV. Finding the files for logging
 a. The logging utilities (tracedmp, tracelog, etc) are part of idw or can be found 
    in \\scratch\scratch\drewsam\Logging (copy all files from this directory for logging.)
 b. The control guid and mof files can be found in the mup, dfs\driver, dfssvc, and dfsm\server diectories.
    They are mupwpp.mof, dfswpp.mof, svcwpp.mof, dfsmwpp.mof, mupctrl.guid, dfsctrl.guid, svcctrl.guid
    Dfsm and Dfssvc are controled by one guid. These files are also updated in \\scratch\scratch\drewsam\Logging
    from time to time. Make sure you have the most up to date files.
V. Flags
   The flags used in mup, dfs, and dfssvc are:
   DEFAULT 	0x0001
   TRACE_IRP	0x0004 (not used in dfsvc)
   ALL_ERROR	0x2000
   ERROR	0x4000

   TRACE_IRP - logs that will help track the path of an IRP.
   ERROR - logs of errors that occured. These are only actually logged if there was an error.
   ALL_ERROR - all error logs, regardless of whether there was an error or not
VI. Level
  HIGH 0x1  - only the most important logs
  NORM 0x2
  LOW  0x4  - all logs 
VII. Troubleshooting
 a. Problems with logging pointers on ia64. There were many iterations of problems with WMI logging
    on ia64. Check that in the mof file all pointers are type ItemPtr and that the format string
    uses %n!p! and not %n!08x!
 b. A good source to contact with problems is either  DrewSam (originally put logging in DFS and MUP) 
    or IanServ (the guy we got logging from).



ADDING NEW LOGS
---------------

I. Add logs to source files
   Simply add new logs using the logging macros (DFS_TRACE_HIGH, MUP_TRACE_HIGH, etc) to the source code.
II. Run wpp01.exe
   From the directory with the modified source run \nt\base\fs\mup\wml\wpp01.exe
   This will generate two files: XXXwpp.h, and newXXXwpp.mof
III. Append the mof files
   Append the contentes of newXXXwpp.mof to the end of XXXwpp.mof
IV. Copy the MSG_ID's
   Copy the lines from XXXwpp.h of the form "#define MSG_ID_*" into XXXwml.h
   remove the old MSG_ID defines form XXXwml.h
V. Copy the traceguid
   Replace the first trace guid in XXXwml.c with the new trace guid in XXXwpp.h
   NOTE: do not replace the control guid!!!
VI. Build
  The code should now build fine.

Here is a list of all NTFS design issues which have come up that effect the
structure, along with current resolution (if there is one) of the issue.  The
resolution of these issues affects the "NTFS Design Specification 1.1" issued
May 29, 1991.  This list will be the final qualification to the spec until
there is time to update it to a form which reflects the actual implementation.
Of course the most precise definition of NTFS will always be in the header
file which describes its structure: ntfs.h.

These issues have been collected primarily from our own internal review and
the feedback received from MarkZ.  They are listed here in no particular
order.

Issue 1:

    Support for nontagged attributes is a pain in the low-level attribute
    routines, as well as in Format and ChkDsk.  They are of very little
    value to the File System in terms of space or performance.

    Resolution:

    Nontagged attributes are being dropped for the purposes of NTFS's own
    use of attributes to implement the disk structure.  Nontagged attributes
    will be supported with the general table support.

Issue 2:

    The EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES attribute, should have a better name, and its
    definition should be changed to simplify various NTFS algorithms.

    Resolution:

    The attribute name has been changed to the ATTRIBUTE_LIST attribute.
    It is still only created when a file requires more than one file record
    segment.  At that time it is created to list all attributes (including
    those in the base file record) by type code and (optional) name.  it is
    ordered by Attribute Type Code and Attribute Name.

    One reason for this change is to facilitate the enumeration of all
    attributes for a file with multiple file record segments.  This
    slightly different definition also gives NTFS's attribute placement
    policy more freedom to shuffle attributes around within the file
    record segments.

Issue 3:

    Attribute ordering rules within the file, within each file record segment,
    and within the ATTRIBUTE_LIST were not completely specified.

    Resolution:

    The only rule for the ordering of attributes within each file, if there
    are multiple file record segments, is that STANDARD_INFORMATION must be
    in the base file record segment, and (at least the first part of) the
    ATTRIBUTE_LIST attribute must also be in the base file record segment.
    In general, the system should try to keep the other system-defined
    attributes with the lowest Attribute Type Codes present in the base file
    record segment when possible, for performance reasons.

    Within each file record segment, attributes will be ordered by type code,
    name, and then value.  (If an attribute is not unique in type code and
    name, then it must be indexed and the value must be referenced.)

    The entries of the ATTRIBUTE_LIST will be ordered by attribute code and
    name.

    Reliance on these ordering rules may be used to speed up attribute lookup
    algorithms.

Issue 4:

    NTFS is NOT secure on removeable media without data encryption.

    Resolution:

    Functionality for the encryption of communications and physical media
    is already planned for Product 2 of NT, at which time we will decide
    what the best mechanism will be for integrating this support with
    removeable NTFS volumes.  We must insure now that this can be implemented
    in a upward-compatible manner.

Issue 5:

    It would be very desirable for WINX to have the ability to uniquely
    identify and open files by a small number.

    Resolution:

    Logically the ability to use this functionality must be controlled by
    some privilege, as it is expensive and nearly impossible to come up with a
    consistent strategy on how to do correct path traversal checking, in a
    system such as NTFS which supports multiple directory links to a single
    file.  Once the requirement for a special privilege is accepted, it is
    relatively easy for NTFS to support an API which would allow files to
    be opened by their (64-bit) File Reference number.  The File Reference
    is perfect for this purpose, as it includes a 16-bit cyclically-reused
    sequence number to detect the attempt to use a stale File Reference.
    I.e., the original file with the same 48-bit Base File Record address has
    been deleted, and a new file has been created at the same address.)

    THIS REQUIRES A NEW NT I/O API.

Issue 6:

    Enumeration of files in a directory in NT could be very slow, since
    to get more than just a file's name requires reading (at least) the
    base file record for the file.

    Resolution:

    The initial NT-based implementation of NTFS will come up with a
    strategy for clustering file record segments together in the MFT for
    files created in the same directory.  Current thinking is that this
    will be done *without* change to the NTFS structure definition.  So,
    for example, the first 128 files in a directory might be contiguous in
    the MFT, and then the second 128 will also be contiguous, etc.  This
    will allow the implementation to prefetch files up to 128 file record
    segments at a time with a large spiral read, then expect cache hits during
    the enumeration.

    Secondly, at some point the implementation will cache enumeration
    information, to make subsequent enumeration of the same directory
    extremely fast.

Issue 7:

    Is it an unnecessary complexity to NTFS to support multiple collating
    rules, as opposed to a simple byte-comparison collation?  Note that
    frequently the caller collates himself anyway.

    Resolution:

    This is not resolved yet pending further discussion.

    The current reason NTFS plans to support multiple collating rules,
    is that collating in the caller can have bad performance and response
    characteristics in large directories.  For example, consider a Windows
    App which requests the enumeration of a directory with 200 files (possibly
    over the network to a heavily loaded server), and it is going to
    display this enumeration in a List box with 10 or 20 lines.  If it
    does not have to collate the enumeration, it can start displaying
    as soon as it receives part of the enumeration.  Otherwise it has
    to wait to get the entire enumeration before it can collate and display
    anything.

Issue 8:

    Should there be a bit in STANDARD_INFORMATION to indicate whether a
    file record has an INDEX attribute or not?

    Resolution:

    There is no plan to do this, unless we find additional reasons
    to do so that we are missing.  Currently we see how this bit could
    speed the rejection of illegal path specifications, but it would
    not speed the acceptance of correct ones.  Note that from the structure
    of NTFS, it is legal for a file to have both an INDEX attribute *and*,
    for example, a DATA attribute.

Issue 9:

    The algorithms and consistency rules surrounding the 8.3 indices need to
    be clarified.

    Resolution:

    This will be done by 7/31.

Issue 10:

    Why not eliminate the VERSION attribute and move it to
    STANDARD_INFORMATION?

    Resolution:

    We will do this, and then define an additional file attribute
    and/or field which controls whether or not versioning is enabled and
    possibly how many versions are allowed for a file.

Issue 11:

    There should be a range of system-defined attribute codes which are
    not allowed to be duplicated, as this will speed up some of the
    lookup algorithms.

    Resolution:

    This will be done.

Issue 12:

    Is duplication of the log file the correct way to add redundancy to
    NTFS to allow mounting in the event of read errors.

    Resolution:

    Upon further analysis, it was determined that the needed redundancy
    was incorrectly placed.  It is more important to duplicate the first
    few entries of the MFT, than to duplicate the start of the log file.
    This change will be made.

Issue 13:

    The spec describes how access to individual attribute types may be
    controlled by special ACEs, which is incompatible with the current
    NT APIs and our security strategy.

    Resolution:

    This will be fixed.  Access to user-defined attributes will be controlled
    by the READ_ATTRIBUTES and WRITE_ATTRIBUTES access rights.

Issue 14:

    A file attribute should be added which supports more efficient handling
    of temporary files.

    Resolution:

    An attribute will be added for files, and possibly directories, which
    will enable NTFS to communicate "temporary file" handling to the Cache
    Manager.  Temporary files will never be set dirty in the Cache Manager
    or written to disk by the Lazy Writer, although the File Record will
    be correctly updated to keep the volume consistant.  If a temporary file
    is deleted, then all writes to its data are eliminated.  If MM discovers
    that memory is getting tight, it may choose to flush data to temporary
    files, so that it can free the pages.  In this case the
    correct data for the file will eventually be faulted back in.

    This makes the performance of I/O to temporary files approach the
    performance of putting them on a RAM disk.  An advantage over RAM disk,
    though, is that no one has to specify how much space should be used
    for this purpose.

Issue 15:

    It would be nice to have some flag in each file record segment to say
    if it is in use or not.  This would simplify chkdsk algorithms, although
    it would require the record to be written on deletion.

    Resolution:

    This will be done.  It is difficult to suppress the write of the file
    record on deletion anyway.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\fs\ntfs\specnote.txt ===
These are a collection of notes that should be updated in the NTFS Design
Specification.  These do not include many changes which will be obvious
from a pass through ntfs.h - which will be a necessary activity for the
next spec update.

    File Number changed to File Reference, to denote that its use can
    become invalid (sequence number incremented).

    The second copy of the log is not needed, but a second copy of the MFT
    is, which just has the same first three file records: MFT, MFT2 and LOG.

    Add a discussion of the Boot Sector / Boot file, and a figure to show
    dual boot records and dual MFTs.

    Forget the security on attributes, just use READ_ATTRIBUTE, WRITE_ATTRIBUTE
    privilege on the file.

    The boot file is strictly a matter between Format, bootstrap, and the Mount
    code.  Where it goes and what its contents are will be system-specific.
    For NT:

        There will be one boot record at sector 0, and one on the last
        sector of the volume.  Each boot record will contain the cluster size
        and the starting LCN for the Master File, and the Master File 2.
        As a suggestion, Format on NT should start the MFT at LCN = 1 on
        the disk, and MFT2 should start three file record segments before the
        other boot record.  MFT2 contains mirrored copies of the first file
        record segment for the MFT, MFT2, and the Log file.  The boot file
        on NT just contains these two boot records.

        DOS may choose to actually have a bootstrap following the first
        boot record in the boot file, and it could just be the first N
        clusters of the disk.

    "Ideas by Butzi":

        Disks should schedule reads ahead of writes

        Have some way to detect temporary files (file attribute
        and/or directory attribute), and never write their data
        (or update valid data length).  This would be like putting
        \temp on the RAM disk on OS/2.

        make writes on close a dynamic option?

The database is organized as a tree structure. The root-node of the tree(henceforth referred to as the super-root) contains a list of shares that have been successfully connected in the past. Each entry in the this list points to the root directory of that share. A node in the tree is either a directory node or a file node, the latter always being a leaf node.  Each node in the tree is uniquely identified by a 32 bit number called the Inode. All inodes are part of an inode table, which also does double duty as a priority queue. Moreover, given an Inode it is possible to obtain the fully qualified UNC path which represents the Inode. As an implementation detail, each inode is nothing but an index in the inode table. Each node in the database is represented by a file. The files are named by converting their Inode number to an 8 hex-digit ASCII value and are in a well know directory. The super root is 00000001 while the Inode table is 00000002. The directory inode files contain the information about  the children of that directory., in the form of a sequence of directory entries as described in DE below. The file inode files contain the actual contents of the file.  Inode table entry  notation  An inode I is represented as I(IP, S, IC, FOI, all other attributes) as follows 32 bit parent Inode # - for the root if a share, this value is 0 Contents associated with the inode. For a file this the entire file data. For a directory this  is the set of directory entries. Inode Attribute (Enumerated type) -       OI stands for original  Inode. Indicates that the contents of this  inode  originally came from the net and is in use. UOI, stands for Unassociated Original Inode LI, stands for Local Inode. This has the content created offline. NB: There is no such thing as an ULI, ie: Unassociated Local Inode. Other Information - Sync Status, duplicated for the sake of the agent - UI information (See the directory entry below) - forward and backward pointers pointing to other inodes forming a  doubly linked MRU list.  These entries are used in deciding which entries to scavenge if the CSC database grows beyond a prespecified disk quota. Directory entry notation: An entry with the name   in a directory represented by inode IP is represented as <IP,  >(Current Inode, Sync Status, Original Inode, RenameFrom Inode, All Other Attributes)  Current Inode The inode that currently has the contents of this entry Synchronization Status Status  (bit field) S - Sparse This bit is set only for server objects. Files are marked sparse when the contents L - created offlline Object which is created while in disconnected state D - marked as deleted An object is marked deleted when it is obtained from the  Server or currently has directory contents from a directory on  the server R - reused  An object from the server that is marked deleted and is  recreated DM - Data modified offline (Cannot coexist with L above) An object from the server whose data has gone through some  Change while offline AM - An object whose attributes have gone through some change while  Offline. This includes, directory attribbutes and last modified  Original Inode: The Inode which represents the contents cached from the server.  For a replica, the The Current Indoe and the Original Inode are Identical when the entry has not gone through a namespace operation while  offline All Other Attributes Last Modified Time from the server Used to detect conflicts UI Information Whether the entry is pinned for a user Whether the entry is pinned for system Pin count when an entry is pinned for neither user nor system Filesystem Attributes:  (referred to as FA, as a group) Name(s): Both LFN and 8.3 names Filesystem Attributes:  filesystem attributes last modified time Security Attributes Per user maximal access rights for N user. The current value of N is 4. Other Notations: t care. ie. the contents of the field are immaterial denotes a non-exitent Inode Empty denotes 0 sized contents of an Inode inidcates no flags set indicates a value of any of the above types that needs to be retained while carrying out a transformation Parent Inode of I Namespace Operations: There are four possible modes of operations of the redir with respect to CSC, depending the type of the share that is being accessed. CSC disabled shares Under this mode, no caching is done for this share. Offline operations fail with appropriate errors. Explicit pinning is also disabled. Auto_Reintegration Shares Under this mode, while online, every file that is opened on the share is cached in the CSC database under it s namespace as found on the share.  It is OK to pin files. Any part of the namespace that has been marked as having been modified offline is invisible when offline. This situation can occur when the share went offline and modifications were done wither to file data or the namespace changed through create/delete/rename operations. Then when it went online, either no-reintegration was performed or all the modifications could not be reintegrated. While online the redir operates as if the CSC database were a write-through cache. This is the  truth is on the server  mode of operations. The remote and the local copes are opened for files in sync, read operations are satisfied locally, while write operations are done on the server and on the local file. Example of invisible namespace: if a file   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\foo.txt  that was cached online and modified offline, did not get reintegrated, then when online this copy is not visible, only the server copy is. Non_Auto_Reintration shares The principal difference between this and Auto_reintgeration share is that files are not cached when they are opened. All other details remain the same. The fact that these are no_auto_reintegration shares means that UI needs to explicitly ask questions or invoke some other means of bringing the user in the loop while doing reintegration. VDO shares The files under these shares get cached when opened. For those files that are fully cached in the database, the files opened locally and all operations are satisfied locally. This is the  truth is on the client  mode. What follows is a description of how the namespace operations are performed  by CSC. The operations are described in the notation defined above. They are split into two types a) Online and b) Offline.  When online, a name that has been created/modified/marked-deleted while offline and not successfully integrated is made invisible during online operations.  The operations below describe the namespace operations. VDO shares operate in offline mode for files fully cached and in online mode for files not fully cached. IRenameFrom and IORG elements of the data structure make it possible to translate the localname into the remote name and vice-versa. Lookup: Given a fully qualified UNC path such as \\server\share\dir1\dir2..\dirn\file1, The path is broken down item by item to find the Inode that represents the item in the hierarchy. This \\server\share are looked up in the super-root, and the root Inode corresponding to \\server\share is found.  Henceforth we will refer to the root inode corresponding to any share as I0. Given I0 (say 0x10), find the inode file corresponding to I0 (00000010), run through the list of  DEs in this file matching dir1 in the above example and obtain the Inode corresponding to dir1 I1. Traverse I1 to look for the name dir2 and so on till the name file1 is obtained from In. Create Operations Online: Create a replica of remote item   under a directory represented by IP - Create IORG(IP, Empty, OI, X) - Create <IP, >(IORG, 0, IORG, X) Offline: a) Create a new item   in offline state under the directory represented by IP - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) - Create <IP,  >(I, L, I, X) b) Create a new item which is of the same name as a server item marked deleted: - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) <IP,  , D, IORG, X) => <IP, >(I, R, IORG, X) delete I Delete Operation Online: Delete a replica of   from directory represented by IP If the server operation succeeds and the database entry and all it s ancestors are in sync with the server then - delete <IP,  >(IORG,0,IORG,NULL,X) - delete IORG(IP,0,X,OI,X) - delete contents of IORG Offline: a) Delete a replica of an item   from directory represented by IP 1) <IP,  >(IORG, 0, IORG, X)    => <IP, >(NULL, D, IORG, X) 2) IORG(IP,  X,OI, X)  => IORG(IP, Empty, UOI, X) Truncate the contents of the inode IORG if foo is a file. If foo is a directory, then we want to keep the contents of IORG, which are the directory entries of foo cached from the server. Comments: Associate a NULL inode with <IP, >,  note the original contents in IORG field and mark the entry  D (deleted). Mark the Inode which represents the original contents as Unassociated Origianl Inode. b) Delete   created in offline state in directory IP.  Delete <IP,  >(I, L, I, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) c) Delete   reused in offline state in directory IP.  <IP,  >(I, R, IORG, X) => <IP,  >(NULL, D, IORG, X) Delete <IP,  >(I, L, L, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be marked OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) Rename Rename item   in directory IP1 to item   in directory  Online: - Save all the attributes of foo - Delete <IP1,  foo>(I,V,V,V) - Create <IP2,  >(I,V,V,V)  - I(IP1,V,V, V) => I(IP2,V,V, V) Offline: -      Save all the attributes of  <IP1,  Execute offline delete of foo as done above, except for any Original Inode and it s content Execute offline Create of bar with all the attributes of foo, including it s inode Reintegration The reintegartion of a share is a 3 pass operation, the passes being  Remove all the files/directories from the server that have been deleted and renamed  when offline to a holding directory.  This step essentially remove the elements from the server name space which after a successfull reintegration should not be there. Create elemnts on the server corresponding to the new namespace that is generated while offline. Restore the state on the database and the server, based on the conflicts encountered. Initialization: Create a temporary  directory on the server(say reint). This directory is our holding directory for various files/directories. Create two conflict lists, OriginalConflictList and CurrentConflictList.  Pass 1: Starting from the root of a share, do a depth first traversal of the original tree. This is done by traversing  the  IORG inode of a directory. Only the directories which are replicas of a directory on the server will have this entry. While traversing the original tree in a depth first manner, for all entries which are either marked D (deleted) or R (Reused), ie. entries of the type <IP1, >(X, D, IORG, X) or  <IP1, foo>(X, R, IORG, X).        - Accumulate the original UNC path as obtained from the original tree in the CSC database. In depth first order, ie. leaf first then it s immediate parent then it s parent etc.,  If there is no conflict between the version of the replica and the server copy If it is marked D or R (deleted offline, or deleted offline and then later reused) If the IORG is marked as Unassociated Original Inode (UOI), then this entry has been deleted and it s contents have been deleted (may be through a simple delete or one or more renames followed by a delete).  If Delete of the entity on the server succeeds or this is a directory, in which case the failure to delete is treated as benign conflict. Delete the entry from the database Delete the IORG inode Delete the contents associated with IORG. Else this must have been renamed to some other entry do a rename on the server of the file/directory with the accumulated UNC path to the temp directory on the server,  the new name being the same as that of the IORG entry. This ensures no name collision in the temp directory, as the inodes are unique. Let us call the name in the temporary directory ASCII(IORG), for the item with IORG as the original Inode, on the server that has been renamed to ASCII equivalent of it's Inode name in the temp directory.  If there is a conflict, ie. the file/directory on the server is newer than the one in the CSC database, or an operation fails, attach the original UNC name together with  it s current  Inode to the head of conflict list we call the OriginalConflictsList. We use this in pass two to find if any newly created entries are conflicting, and in pass 3 to restore the saved entries back into the original namespace. This ensures that, all the files and directories which are supposed to either have been deleted from the server, or are renamed to some other file/directory while offline, are removed from the server namespace. We have the copies of those files/directories which got renamed, into the temp directory and will use these when we get to pass 2. Example:  If for the UNC path   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\dir2\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\dir2\foo.txt  as obtained by traversing the original tree of the CSC database,  <IP1,  foo.txt >(X, X, IORG1, X)  IORG1(X, X, UOI, X) and <IP2,  , R, IORG2, X)        IORG2(X, X, OI, X) Then delete foo.txt on the server then rename dir1 to ASCII(IORG2) Pass 2: Starting from the root, traverse the current tree in the CSC database, thus for a directory <IP1,  >(I, X, X, X), traverse I, while accumulating the UNC path up to I For every entry that is marked L, R, M, IE. it is either  created offline due to create/rename or  is a replica that has gone through a delete/create or rename/create cycle while offline or  is a replica whose contents have been modified offline in some way. So if it is a file, it s data /attributes/timestamps have been modified while offline, or if it is a directory, some entries have been added/deleted or attributes/timestamps of the directory have been modified while offline) the entry is marked L or R and the Inode is marked OI,  <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, OI, X) Then this is a new entry created offline from the contents of an Original Inode (through one or more renames). Check in the Original Conflicts list whether there is an entry corresponding to I. If there is no conflict,  Then there must be an item ASCII(I) on the server, rename that entry to the accumulated UNC name. If the rename operation fails, then attach the entry to the list we call CurrentConflictList. Note that this is a second conflict list which is different from the OriginalConflictList. The CurrentConflictList has UNC names that correspond to the current namespace if all reintegration had succeeded. If the rename operation succeeds then Convert the new entry to a replica using the following transformation <IP1,  >(I, L, NULL, X) => <IP1,  >(I, 0, I, X) stamp it with the timestamp from the entry from the server. Else  it exists in the conflict list, we cannot reintegrate this entry, ignore it and all it s descendents.  Else if it is marked L or R and the Inode is marked LI IE it is represented as <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, LI, X) Then this represents a new name and new content. Create it.  If create succeeds <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) I(X, X, LI, X) => I(X, X, OI, X) ignore all it s descendents Else if it is marked as D Ignore it, it must be in the conflicts list or else it would have been taken care of in pass 1 Else if it is marked M IE the contents of a remote entry have been modified offline; it is represented by <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) I(IP, X, OI, X) Modify it on the server If modification succeeds  Remove the marking M from the entry IE <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) ignore all it s descendents Note: The problem of cross-linked remote entries is side stepped because of the way renaming is accomplished during reintegration. Pass 3:  This is a cleanup pass. The key cleanup we do here is to remove those entries that have been renamed to some other entries. In pass 2, the renamed entries have already been associated to the appropriate contents. Traverse the original tree ( we could also traverse the current tree as it is a superset of the original tree) for every entry that is marked as D or R and the IORG is marked as OI,  If IORG is not in the ConflictList then it has been assigned to some other name Delete the directory entry while keeping the inode. Traverse the OriginalConflictList from it s head to tail and rename back all the entries from the temporary directory to their original UNC names as maintained in the OriginalConflictsList.

Introduction This note document describes the salient features of client side caching (CSC) for NT5 and Memphis.  I want to make it clear up front that. T this architecture is an evolution from current ourWindows networking  current code basetechnology and customer perception of our networking products; it does not propose a fundamental rethinking or reworking of sameWindows networking.  Furthermore, I am attempting just enough CSC to meet NT5 requirements, but not so much CSC that we get ourselves in trouble down the road.  The requirements I am most familiar with are the ZAW requirements. Client side caching gives off-line access to files when the network version of the file is otherwise unavailable, or when it is undesirable to load the server with file requests. A client accesses the cached copy of a file using the same filename as when the client is connected to the network. Scenarios CSC must address the following usage scenarios: A user wants to make sure that specific files are available to him when he disconnects his laptop computer from the network.  He should not need to learn any new file names or anything, and this action by the user should not cause any surprises to the user when he is connected to his corporate network. An administrator wants to configure a number of workstations to boot from a network share.  The administrator should be able to support 100 s of clients in this way using a Pentium class server.  The workstations should reasonably continue to function in the face of network problems. An administrator wants to configure a number of applications to be run from the network.  The administrator should be able to support 100 s of clients in this way using a Pentium class server.  The application should reasonably continue to function in the face of network problems. A user has one desktop computer and one portable computer.  This user brings the portable computer to work every morning and connects it to the network, but works on the desktop computer during the day.  The user expects to undock the portable and resume work on the files at home.  The user, through minimal UI, expects the desktop data to be present when the portable computer is taken home and used. A student in a lab at college roams from machine to machine, expecting his desktop data to be available on the current machine.  This desktop data must not be available to the next student that logs onto the machine. A user of Microsoft Office wants to edit a document that someone else has open.  This user wants to get all the normal Office verbiage regarding shared document editing. CSC is tied to the SMB redirector, and operates only with NT5.0 (& later) servers  (i.e. not W95 servers, Netware servers, HTTP, FTP servers, for instance.) The administrative granularity of caching is on a per-share basis   administrators may mark a share as cacheable or not.Requirements Following are the requirements for CSC An NT or W9x5  system hosting CSC must be at least as robust as the same system not hosting CSC. For both NT5 and W9x iIn the NT5 time frame, CSC can be tied exclusively to SMB file sharing, and can require 5.0 NTS SMB servers.  CSC caches files that are accessed using Win32. CSC should improve the robustness of network access.  If network problems break the connection from a client to a server then the local cache should be utilized where appropriate to  cover up  the network problems. CSC must give client side applications the ability to designate certain files that are to be available even if the computer is disconnected from the network (i.e. pinned for off-line access).  Applications will refer to these files when off-line with the same Win32 file name as when connected to the network.  Preservation of inter-client file sharing semantics is not required during off-line file access and update. Off-line means that the server is unreachable for any reason. CSC must give server administrators the ability to designate whether or not server files are automatically appropriate for off-line CSC access.  The granularity of administration is on a share basis. Files not specifically marked for off-line access are not available when off-line.  HYPERLINK   CSC must minimally perturb W32 file I/O performance and semantics.  CSC must not introduce undue pauses or latency during any file operation. Network aware applications must be able to enjoy the performance advantages of CSC even if these applications require strict adherence to inter-client file sharing rules when connected to the network and the server is available (i.e. opens flow). The previous requirement notwithstanding, it must be possible to indicate to CSC that inter-client file sharing rules are not required for a given server share even when connected to the network and the server is available  (i.e. opens do not flow). CSC need only support whole-file caching.  There must be a way to avoid accidentally filling the client side cache when applications such as the Windows Explorer scan all the files in a directory and extract icons. CSC must have a means to propagate a file inward from a server to replace an old version of the file in the client cache: Remote boot and aApplication maintenance requires that such inward propagation is automatic and involves no interaction with the user. Other instances of file pinning require explicit user intervention for inward propagation   there must be appropriate UI. CSC must have a means to propagate a file outward from the cache to replace an old version of the file on the server: Remote boot and legacy application support requires that such outward propagation is automatic and involves no interaction with the user. Other instances of file pinning require explicit user intervention for outward propagation   there must be appropriate UI. For both the inward and outward propagation cases, complete file replacement is the conflict resolution policy.  If further refinement is required, the time stamp of the file is used (latest wins) followed by file size (largest wins), followed by a coin toss. Asynchronous inward and outward propagation should generally occur only when a file is closed.  However there are files that are never closed on the client; a prime example is the system hive.  There must be a means to force such files to be outward propagated even while open. CSC must integrate sensibly with DFS.  CSC must be aware of DFS alternates, and rely on the fact that some (completely independent) agent is keeping DFS alternates in sync.  CSC can select any of the DFS alternates for file put-back and/or cache filling. Any UI introduced by CSC must be usable by a novice PC user.  Specifically, it must be very simple for the end user to designate files that should be available when the user is disconnected from the network, or when the server is unavailable.  The result of this designation should be simple, predictable, and intuitive to the end user whether connected or off-line. CSC must give the client a means to designate how much local disk space the client side cache can use. Architecture CSC Client Components The CSC implementation has 3 major client components CSC File System Component: On W95, this is in a vxd that is installed between the IFSMgr and the network file system drivers.  On NT, tThis component is part of the SMB redirector.  On either platform, this component  and has the following subparts: Disconnected File System Driver (DFSD): responsible for mimicking the behavior of remote file systems in the absence of a network connection.  The Record Manager (below) is used by the DFSD to mimic remote file systems while in the disconnected state. Record Manager (RM): A local persistent database of servers, file naming, descriptors and data is maintained in order to serve as a cache for network activity.  As an example, to cache   HYPERLINK \\\\penmktg\\public\\foo\\bar.doc  \\penmktg\public\foo\bar.doc , the name   HYPERLINK \\\\penmktg\\public  \\penmktg\public  is maintained in a servers database and points to a database entry corresponding to the root of the server.  The server database entry contains the information for directory foo and its attributes and has a reference to the database entry for bar.doc.  The database entry for bar.doc contains the name, attributes, timestamp, etc. for bar.doc and also contains a reference to the to the entry holding the contents of bar.doc. The record manager also maintains status information such as whether the file is stale, whether the file was created while off-line, whether the file has been modified while off-line, etc.  On NT, the RM holds ACL information for the entries, on Win95 the entire cache is per-user. Persistent Management Database: A priority queue and Record Manager recovery database.  All entries in the Record Manager are queued into the priority queue.  A combination of the hints on the file and the frequency of usage determine the priority of a file.  The priority queue is used as a measure of the importance of the files and hence used for maintaining coherency and managing space.  The Record Manager recovery database tracks deleted record manager entries, for later reuse. CSC Shadow Agent: On both W95 and NT, tThis user mode component is a daemon process that maintains the Record Manager while in connected state.  Any file used by the user is a candidate for inclusion in the Record Manager.  The CSC File System Component detects the fact that the file is a candidate for inclusion during the course of a file open call on the file.  The CSC File System Component creates an entry in the Record Manager indicating a sparse file, and places it in the priority queue.  The CSC Shadow Agent periodically walks the priority queue in the order of priority, looking for sparse files.  When a sparse file is found the agent fills the file using small chunks at a time if it has at least a level 2 opportunistic lock CSC Shadow Network Provider (Shadow NP): On W95, this component makes shadow connections to servers.  In Win95, the MPR manages the multiple networks through the Network Providers.  When a connection attempt is made through one of the MPR APIs, the MPR queries all the network providers sequentially to see whether any of them are going to be able to make the connection.  If no network provider is able to make the connection, this Shadow NP attempts to make a shadow connection to the server and share.  The CSC File System Component makes a shadow connection if the name of the server and share in the Record Manager database, thereby indicating that a normal connection has been made in the past.  The Shadow NP is also responsible for enumerating all the shadow connections when queried by the MPR, and thus all device based and UNC connections look like real connections to the MPR and hence all the applications in Win95. This aspect has been implemented in netapi32.dll. CSC Shell Extensions: These extend the shell to provide a seamless shadowing user interface.  Implemented through the standard shell extensions, these include Adding shadowing-specific items to network file system objects. Adding property sheet pages to show the shadowing properties of files and directories.  For instance, a user can add a file to the cache via a shell context menu on files viewed in the explorer Allowing global views of the shadow cache (i.e. its size and utilization) CSC Client APIs The client side cache is of finite size , and CSC silently evicts files from its cache as required.  There are APIs to suppress eviction on a file-by-file basis; such suppression is called pinning a file to the cache.  There is a PinCount maintained for each cached file, the default value for PinCount is zero.  Only files having a PinCount of zero can be evicted from the cache.  Each pin request increments PinCount by one, each unpin request decrements PinCount by one.  CSC by itself never pins or unpins files. The data that has not been pinned is added up to check whether the disk reservation for CSC has been exceeded. In other words the disk reservation refers only to the space allocated to the unpinned files; pinned files are treated as if the user copied them manually. The following APIs are used to manage the CSC cache: CSCIsCSCEnabled CSCIsCSCEnabled( This API allows an application to find out whether CSC is enabled at this time. Return Value: TRUE means CSC is enabled, FALSE means CSC is disabled. There are no error conditions. CSCPinFile PinFile  CSCPinFile ( LPTSTR Name, // Name of the item DWORD dwHintFlags, // Flags to be Ored for pinning,  // see FLAG_CSC_PIN_XXX  LPDOWRD lpdwStatus, // Status of the item LPDWORD  lpdwResultingPinCount // Pin count for this file LPDWORD  lpdwResultingHintFlags This API allows an application to pin insert a file/directory in the Client-Side-Cache.   If this API returns TRUE then the file is resident in the cache. If any of the pin flags are specified, the API takes the appropriate pinning action. and pinned. Parameters: Name: The fully qualified UNC name of the file or directory to be pinned into the client cache  dwHintFlags These flags are hints to the CSC as to how to treat this entry. These flags are Ored with existing flags on the entry. If the entry is newly created because of this call, then these flags are the only flags on the entry. Examples: Whether, user pinned or system pinned. If folder, whether all  descendents should get the pin count. (Unimplemented) lpdwStatus: The status of the file/folder as defined by the status flags lpdwResultingPinCount:  Each file pinned in the CSC cache has a non-zero PinCount.  Each call to CSCPinFile () increments a file s PinCount by one, each call to CSCUnPinFile () decrements the file s PinCount.  ResultingPinCount returns the file s PinCount resulting from this call. lpdwResultingHintFlags: hint flags after this operation is successful Return Value: The function returns TRUE if successful; FALSE is returned if the function fails. GetLastError () can be called to get extended information about the error. Isaache: I m not sure how shared DLLs and such are to be handled in the NT5 time frame.  Is refcounting pinned files necessary and/or sufficient? CSCUnPinFile CSCUnPinFile ( IN LPTSTR Name,  // Name of the file or directory IN DWORD dwHintlagsMask, //  Bits to be removed from the entry LPDOWRD lpdwStatus, // Status of the item LPDWORD lpdwResultingPinCount // Pin count for this file LPDWORD lpdwResultingHintFlags This API allows the caller to unpin a file or directory from the client side persistent cache. Parameters: Name: The fully qualified UNC name of the item to be unpinned dwPinFlagMask: pin flags to remove from the entry. No error is reported if   if flags to be removed aren t already there on the entry   If one of the inherit flags is removed, the effect occurs   On subsequently created descendents of that folder   Descendents which got the a user/system pincount due   to are unaffected. lpdwStatus: The status of the file as defined by the status flags lpdwResultingPinCount:  Each file pinned in the CSC cache has a non-zero PinCount.  Each call to CSCPinFile () increments a file s PinCount by one, each call to CSCUnPinFile () decrements the file s PinCount.  ResultingPinCount returns the file s PinCount resulting from this call.  A file is no longer pinned to the CSC cache when ResultingPinCount is zero. lpdwResultinHintFlags: pin flags after this operation is successful Return Value: The function returns TRUE if successful. The status bits indicate more information about the item in the cache.  FALSE is returned if the function fails. GetLastError() can be called to get extended information about the error. CSCFindFirstCachedFile HANDLE CSCFindFirstCachedFile ( LPCTSTR Name, OUT LPWIN32_FIND_DATA lpFindFileData, OUT LPDWORD lpdwStatus, OUT LPDWORD lpdwPinCount, OUT LPDWORD lpdwHintFlags, OUT FILETIME *lpftOrgTime; This API allows the caller to enumerate files in the e client side cache. Parameters: Name: Points to a null-terminated string that specifies a valid UNC name for a share.  For the first revision of CSC, Name must have the form   HYPERLINK \\\\server\\share  \\server\share .The API operates like the win32 FindFirstFile API, except that wild cards are not implemented in the first version. If a NULL parameter is passed in, the API begins enumeration of all the   HYPERLINK \\\\server\\share  \\server\share  entries in the client-side-cache. LlpFindFileData: Points to the WIN32_FIND_DATA structure that receives information about the found file or subdirectory.  The structure can be used in subsequent calls to the CSCFindNextCachedFile or CSCFindClose function to refer to the file or subdirectory.  The elements of the WIN32_FIND_DATA structure is filled in just as it would be for a non-cached file,. however a new file attribute may be returned in dwFileAttributes: FILE_ATTRIBUTE_CSC_OUTPROP The cached copy of the file has been modified, and the file needs to be propagated to the server. FILE_ATTRIBUTE_CSC_FILLING The cached copy of the file is currently being filled from the network copy of the file. lpdwStatus: if lpFindFileData is not NULL, this returns the status of the file in terms of the flags defined below.        If lpFindFileData is NULL,  it returns the status of the share as defined by FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_XXX. lpdwPinCount: Pin Count of the file lpftOrgTime: The timestamp of the original file on the server. This value makes sense only when the file/direcotry is a copy of a file on a server. It does not mean anything if the file/directory was created while offline, in which case the status bit FLAG_CSC_LOCALLY_CREATED is set. CSCFindNextCachedFile CSCFindNextCachedFile ( HANDLE hCSCFindHandle, LPWIN32_FIND_DATA lpFindFileData; OUT LPDWORD lpdwStatus, OUT LPDWORD lpdwPinCount, OUT LPDOWRD lpdwHintFlags, OUT FILETIME *lpftOrgTime This function continues a cache file search from a previous call to the CSCFindFirstCachedFile function. Parameters: HCSCFindHandle identifies a search handle returned by a previous call to the CSCFindFirstCachedFile function. LlpFindFileData points to the WIN32_FIND_DATA structure that receives information about the found file or subdirectory.  The structure can be used in subsequent calls to CSCFindNextCachedFile to refer to the found file or directory.  The WIN32_FIND_DATA structure receives data as described in CSCFindFirstCachedFile. lpdwStatus: if the enumeration is for file/folder, this returns the status of the file in terms of the flags defined below.        If  the enumeration is for   HYPERLINK \\\\server\\shares\\  \\server\shares\  this returns the status of the share as defined by FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_XXX. lpdwPinCount: Pin Count of the file lpftOrgTime: The timestamp of the original file on the server. This value makes sense only when the file/direcotry is a copy of a file on a server. It does not mean anything if the file/directory was created while offline, in which case the status bit FLAG_CSC_LOCALLY_CREATED is set. CSCFindClose CSCFindClose ( HANDLE hCSCFindHandle The CSCFindClose function closes the specified cache search handle.  The CSCFindFirstCachedFile and CSCFindNextCachedFile functions use the search handle to locate cached files with names that match the given name. Parameters: HCSCFindHandle identifies the search handle.  This handle must have been previously opened by the CSCFindFirstCachedFile function. CSCForceOutwardPropagation CSCForceOutwardPropagation ( IN LPTSTR Name This API is used to force the outward propagation of a particular file.  The file will be propagated whether or not the file is currently open, it must be used with caution, as an inconsistent version of the file can be cached back to the server. This is a synchronous API, and if the function succeeds the return value is nonzero.  If the function fails, the return value is zero.  To get extended error information, call GetLastError(). CSCSetMaximumCacheSize CSCSetMaximumCacheSize ( IN PLONGLONG FileSizeHigh This API constrains the size of the CSC cache for unpinned files. . The control panel is the client. CSCDeleteCachedFile CSCDeleteCachedFile ( IN LPTSTR // Name of the cached file This API deletes the file from the client side cache. Parameters: Name: The fully qualified UNC name of the file to be deleted Return Value: The function returns TRUE if successful; FALSE is returned on error and GetLastError () can be called to get extended information about the error. Notes: Example error cases are: a) If a directory is being deleted and it has descendents, then this call will fail b) If a file is in use, this call will fail. C) If the share on which this item exists is being merged, this call will fail. CSCMergeShare CSCMergeShare( LPTSTR lpszShareName, LPCSCPROC lpfnMergeProgress DWORD dwContext This API  allows the caller to initiate a merge of a share that may  have been modified offline. The API maps a drive to the share that needs merging and uses that drive to do the merge. The mapped drive is reported in the callback at the beginning of the merge in the cFileName field of the lpFind32 parameter of the callback function. The caller of this API must a) use the drive letter supplied to do any operations on the net b) must do all the operations in the same thread that issues this API call. Parameters: lpszShareName Share to make changes. If this is NULL, all  modified  shares are merged lpfnMergeProgress Callback function that informs the caller about the  progress  of the merge. dwContext Context returned during callback Return: TRUE if the function is successful, FALSE if some error was encountered, or the operation was aborted. GetLastError() returns the errorcode. CSCFillSparseFiles CSCFillSparseFiles( LPTSTR lpszName, fFullSync, LPCSCPROC lpprocFillProgress, DWORD dwContext Parameters: lpszName Share or file name to sparsefill. fFullSync If TRUE, files which are not sparse are checked for staleness, and a fill attempted on them lpprocCheckStatusProgress Callback function that informs the caller about the progress  of the status check dwContext Context returned during callback Return: TRUE if the function is successful, FALSE if some error was encountered, or the operation was aborted. GetLastError() returns the errorcode. CSCCopyReplica CSCCopyReplica( LPTSTR lpszFullPath, LPTSTR *lplpszLocalName This API allows the caller to copy the data for the replica of a remote item out of the CSC database into a temporary local file. Parameters: lpszFullPath Full path of the file that needs to be moved/copied lplpszLocalName pointer to a full qualified path of local file that contains the replica  data. This is LocalAlloced by the API. It is the callers resposibility to free it. Return Value: TRUE if successful, FALSE if failed. If FALSE, GetLastError() returns the exact error code. CSCGetSpaceUsage CSCGetSpaceUsage( LPDWORD lpnFileSizeHigh, LPDWORD lpnFileSizeLow This API returns the current space consumption by unpinned data in the csc database. Parameters: lpnFileSizeHigh High dword of the total data size lpfnFileSizeLow Low dword of the total data size Return Value: Returns TRUE if successful. If the return value is FALSE, GetLastError() returns the actual error code. CSCFreeSpace CSCFreeSpace( DWORD nFileSizeHigh, DWORD nFileSizeLow This API frees up the space occupied by unpinned files in the CSC database by deleting them. The passed in parameters are used as a guide to how much space needs to be freed. Note that the API can delete local replicas only if they are not in use at the present time. Parameters: nFileSizeHigh High DWORD of the amount of space to be freed. nFileSizeLow Low DWORD of the amount of space to be freed Return Value: Returns TRUE if successful. If the return value is FALSE, GetLastError() returns the actual error code. CSCEnumForStats CSCMergeShare( LPTSTR lpszShareName, LPCSCPROC lpfnEnumProgress DWORD dwContext This API  allows the caller to enumerate a share or the entrie CSC database to obtain salient statistics. It calls the callback function with CSC_REASON_BEGIN  before beginning the enumeration, for each item it calls the callback with CSC_REASON_MORE_DATA and at the end of the callback, it calls it with CSC_REASON_END. For details of parameters with which the callback is made, see below. Parameters: lpszShareName Share to make changes. If this is NULL, all  shares are enumerated lpfnEnumProgress Callback function that informs the caller about the  progress  of the enumeration. The callback is invoked on every file/directory on the  that is part of the share/database. The only significant parameters are dwStatus, dwHintFlags, dwPinCount,  dwReason, dwParam1 and dwContext. If the item is a file, dwParam1 is 1, for directories, it is 0. dwContext Context returned during callback Return: TRUE if the function is successful, FALSE if some error was encountered, or the operation was aborted. GetLastError() returns the errorcode. CSCDoLocalRename CSCDoLocalRename(     IN  LPCWSTR     lpszSource,     IN  LPCWSTR     lpszDestination,     IN  BOOL        fReplaceFileIfExists     ) This API does a rename in the database. The rename operation can be used to move a file or a directory tree from one place in the hierarchy to another. It s principal use at the present time is for folder redirection of MyDocuments share. If a directory is being moved and such a directory exists at the destination, the API tries to merge the two trees. If a destination file already exists, and fReplaceifExists parameter is TRUE, then an attempt is made to delete the destination file and put the source file in it s place, else an error is retruned. Parameters:     lpszSource              Fully qualified source name (must be UNC). This can be a file or any directory other than the root of a share.     lpszDestination         Fully qualified destination name (must be UNC). This can only be a directory.     fReplaceFileIfExists    replace destination file with the source if it exists Returns:     TRUE if successfull, FALSE otherwise. If the API fails, GetLastError returns the specific     errorcode. CSCDoEnableDisable CSCDoEnableDisable(     BOOL    fEnable Routine Description: This routine enables/disables CSC. It should be used only by the control panel applet. Enable CSC always succeeds. Disable CSC succeeds if there are no files or directories from the local database are open at the time of issuing this call. Parameters:     fEnable enable CSC if TRUE, else disable CSC Returns:     TRUE if successfull, FALSE otherwise. If the API fails, GetLastError returns the specific     errorcode. CSCCheckShareOnline CSCCheckShareOnline(     IN  LPCWSTR     lpszShareName     ) Routine Description: This routine checks whether a given share is available online. Parameters:     lpszShareName Returns:     TRUE if successfull, FALSE otherwise. If the API fails, GetLastError returns the specific     errorcode. LPCSCPROC DWORD (*LPCSCPROC)( LPTSTR lpszName,  DWORD  dwStatus,  DWORD  dwHintFlags,  DWORD dwPinCount,  WIN32_FIND_DATA *lpFind32, DWORD dwReason, DWORD dwParam1, DWORD dwParam2, DWORD dwContext Parameters: lpszName fully qualified UNC path dwStatus status of the entry (see FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_xxx) dwHintFlags hint flags on the entry (see FLAG_CSC_HINT_xxx) dwPinCount pin count of the entry lpFind32 WIN32_FIND_DATA_STRUCTURE of the local copy in the database.  This may be NULL if the callback is CSC_REASON_BEGIN and CSC_REASON_END for a share. During merging this parameter will be non-NULL for  CSC_REASON_BEGIN. The cFileName member of this structure will  Contain the mapped drive letter to the share, through which all net access should be performed. dwReason callback reason (see CSCPROC_REASON_xxx) dwParam1 contents dependent on dwReason above CSCPROC_REASON_BEGIN: If merging is in progress a nozero value of this parameter Indicates that this item conflicts with the remote item. CSCPROC_REASON_MORE_DATA: contains the low order dword of  The amount of the amount of data transferred dwParam2 contents dependent on dwReason above CSCPROC_REASON_MORE_DATA: contains the high order dword of  The amount of the amount of data transferred CSCPROC_REASON_END: contains error codes as defined in winerror.h. If it is ERROR_SUCCESS, then the operation that was started with the CSCPROC_REASON_BEGIN completed successfully. dwContext context passed in by the caller while calling the API Return Value: See CSCPROC_RETURN_xxx. File/Folder Status Bit Definitions: FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_DATA_LOCALLY_MODIFIED   FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_ATTRIB_LOCALLY_MODIFIED FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_TIME_LOCALLY_MODIFIED         FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_STALE FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_LOCALLY_DELETED FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_SPARSE FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_ORPHAN  FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_SUSPECT FLAG_CSC_COPY_STATUS_LOCALLY_CREATED  FLAG_CSC_USER_ACCESS_MASK  FLAG_CSC_GUEST_ACCESS_MASK FLAG_CSC_OTHER_ACCESS_MASK  Share Status Bit Definitions: (Readonly) FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_MODIFIED_OFFLINE FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_CONNECTED FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_FILES_OPEN FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_FINDS_IN_PROGRESS FLAG_CSC_SHARE_STATUS_DISCONNECTED_OP FLAG_CSC_SHARE_MERGING Hint flags Definitions: FLAG_CSC_HINT_PIN_USER When this bit is set, the item is being pinned for the user Note that there is only one pincount allotted for user. FLAG_CSC_HINT_PIN_INHERIT_USER When this flag is set on a folder, all  descendents subsequently Created in this folder get pinned for the user FLAG_CSC_HINT_PIN_INHERIT_SYSTEM When this flag is set on a folder, all descendents  Subsequently  created in this folder get pinned for the  system FLAG_CSC_HINT_CONSERVE_BANDWIDTH When this flag is set on a folder,  for executables and  Other related file, CSC tries to conserver bandwidth By not flowing opens when these files are fully  Cached.

They should be documented here. Change Propagation Inward propagation of  files already cached, happens in two ways a) through usage and b) through CSC client s polling activity. As CSC kernel component sits in the path of all UNC file I/O calls, it knows when a file has gone stale. It does this by comparing the timestamp returned by the server in the first open call, with the one that was stored in the CSC database during an earlier set of opens  . If the two timestamps differ CSC considers the file to have gone stale. The CSC background agent eventually discovers this fact lazily refills this file with the latest data. If   while the file is open and  the buffering state of the file changes, such as when it is opened for writing by some other client, then the file is marked as having gone stale. While the file is in use, no refresh is performed on the file data. For shares which have been marked as running exes (See remoteboot/appinsall considerations below), this mode of inward propagation doesn t happen for certain types of files. In order to conserve net bandwidth,  when  executables and other supporting files are fully cached, opens are not flowed to the share even in connected state. Thus for these types of files, the changes are discovered only when the background agent discovers during lazy polling as described in the paragraph below. The CSC client periodically polls the server to see if cached files have changed at the server .  A file is considered changed if its timestamp, attributes, or size have been modified.  Files changed on the server need to replace files cached on the client; this is called inward propagation. Inwardly propagated files replace locally cached files only if the locally cached file is presently closedIf the file that has changed on the server is currently open at the client, it is only marked stale otherwise fresh data is obtained from the server. .  Inward propagation is governed by the CSC_AUTO_INWARD attribute on each server share: CSC_AUTO_INWARD == TRUE: Files changed at the server are migrated to the client, and replace the local version, so long as the local version has not been modified and so long as the cached copy of the file is not currently open. CSC_AUTO_INWARD == FALSE: UI is available to show files changed at the server that can or should replace files on the client.  UI is available for the client to decide whether to take the server file or not. Files changed on the client need to replace files stored on the server.  Outward propagation is governed by the CSC_AUTO_OUTWARD attribute on each server share: CSC_AUTO_OUTWARD == TRUE: Any and all files modified, created, or deleted on the client are pushed back to the server, regardless of the current time stamp of server files. No UI intervention, unless the push back fails due to persistent network problems, permission problems, etc.  Push back happens when CSC decides it should happen, providing the local file is currently closed. CSC_AUTO_OUTWARD == FALSE: UI is available on the client to show files changed on the client that can or should replace files at the server.  UI is available for the client to decide whether to propagate the file to the server or not.  CSC does not cache directories, but it does create a cached directory entry for files that are locally cached.  For instance, if a server directory contains files   and  , but only   is locally cached on the client, then the disconnected client will see only   in an enumeration of the directory. CSC Server Components The NT5 SMB server allows the server admistrator to Cacheable Shares CSC mark inga of share is an indication that the files on that share can be implicitly cached.share with CSC flags to control client caching behavior.  The CSC client, with open behavior and propagation governed by the share settings, can cache files for off-line access in shares so marked, however these files are not automatically pinned into the client side cache.  Thus CSCCSC share marking is only as    to clients connecting to the share.   When connected, there is no behavior difference between CSC marked shares and CSC unmarked shares, other than to use the locally cached data for performance reasons. Specifically, the win32 sharing semantics works as expected, when connected to the net.  When a file on a cacheable share is first opened, CSC forwards the open and other file operations to the server.  In the meantime, CSC begins capturing the file data and  metadataand metadata (e.g. attributes, dates, sizes, etc.) into its local persistent cache.  If the file is closed and subsequently reopened, and if the file content has been completely captured in the local cache, the new open and subsequent file operations are directed to the locally cached file.  If the file content is not completely captured in the local cache, the open is directed to the server.  This behavior is transparent above Win32, except that a client expecting inter-client file sharing will be broken when operating on a cache-enabled share.  A file is either completely cached or it is not persistently cached at all.  The default setting for a share is not cacheable.  CSC Server APIs The following APIs are available to manage the CSC settings for an NT5 SMB share: NetShareSetInfo This API is used to set the CSC attributes of a server share. NET_API_STATUS NetShareSetInfo ( LPTSTR servername, LPTSTR sharename, DWORD level LPBYTE buf LPDWORD parm_err Parameters: Servername:  Pointer to a Unicode string containing the name of the remote server on which the function is to execute. A NULL pointer or string specifies the local computer. ShareName:  Pointer to a Unicode string containing the network name of the share to set information on. Level: Has value 1007, indicating that the buf parameter points to a SHARE_INFO_1007 structure (below) NetShareGetInfo This API is used to get the CSC attributes of a server share. NET_API_STATUS NetShareGetInfo ( LPTSTR servername, LPTSTR sharename, DWORD level, LPBYTE *bufptr, Parameters: Servername: Pointer to a Unicode string containing the name of the remote server on which the function is to execute.  A NULL pointer or string specifies the local computer. Sharename: Pointer to a Unicode string containing the network name of the share to get information on. Level: Has value 1007, indicating that level 1007 information should be returned, and bufptr should be set to point to resulting SHARE_INFO_1007 structure.  Bufptr should be freed with NetApiBufferFree() when no longer needed. SHARE_INFO_1007 Typedef struct _SHARE_INFO_1007 {     DWORD shi1007_flags;     LPTSTR shi1007_AlternateDirectoryName; } SHARE_INFO_1007, *PSHARE_INFO_1007, *LPSHARE_INFO_1007; Shi1007_flags: CSC_CACHEABLE indicates that the client can safely cache files on this directory for off-line access CSC_NOFLOWOPS indicates that the client need not send opens or other operations to the server when accessing its locally cached copies of files in this share CSC_AUTO_INWARD indicates that files changed on the server should automatically replace cached copies on the client CSC_AUTO_OUTWARD indicates that files cached on the client should automatically replace copies on the server AlternateDirectoryName If set, this is the name of the alternate directory where COW files should be written.  See the (to be written) COW specification for details. CSC SMB Protocol Modifications The SMB protocol is enhanced to allow the server to communicate the CSC share settings to the client. When a client connects to a server resource, an SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX (TC&X) message is sent to the server.  The request and response formats are unchanged for CSC, however if the negotiated dialect is DOS LANMAN2.1 or later, the OptionalSupport field of the response has four new bit definitions as below: TC&X Server Response Description UCHAR WordCount; Count of parameter words = 3 UCHAR AndXCommand; Secondary (X) command;  0xFF = none UCHAR AndXReserved; Reserved (must be 0) USHORT AndXOffset; Offset to next command WordCount USHORT OptionalSupport; Optional support bits USHORT ByteCount; Count of data bytes;    min. = 3 UCHAR Service[]; Service type connected to.

Server bandwidth conserved for executables SMB_CSC_AUTO_OUTWARDSMB_CSC_NO_CACHING 0x000C20 Persistent cFiles changed on the client should automatically replace cached copies on the serveraching is not allowed CSC periodically polls the server to see if cached files have changed at the server .  A file is considered changed if its timestamp or attributes have been modified.  Files changed on the server need to replace files cached on the client; this is called inward propagation. Inwardly propagated files replace locally cached files only if the locally cached file is presently closed.  Inward propagation operates in 1 of 2 modes per server/share combination: Automatic or semi-automatic Automatic: Files changed at the server are migrated to the client, whether or not the client has modified the local copy, so long as the cached copy of the file is not currently open.  Zero UI unless errors happen.  CSC initiates it whenever CSC deems appropriate Semi-Automatic: Files changed at the server are migrated to the client, and replace the local version, so long as the local version has not been modified and so long as the cached copy of the file is not currently open.  If a local file has been modified, UI is available for the client to decide whether to take the server file or not at the user s convenience (while connected, of course). Files changed on the client need to replace files stored on the server.  CSC operates in 1 of 2 push back modes per server/share: automatic or semi-automatic: Automatic: Any and all files modified, created, or deleted on the client are pushed back to the server, regardless of the current time stamp of server files.  Client always wins.  Absolutely no UI intervention, unless the push back fails due to persistent network problems, permission problems, etc.  Push back happens when CSC decides it should happen, providing the local file is currently closed. Semi-automatic: If the attributes of the modified file have not changed on the server from when the client cached it, then the CSC client software silently writes the file to the server, completely overwriting the server's version of the file.  CSC makes no attempt to save the previous version of the file.  Created files and directories are silently created at the server if they do not presently exist at the server.  Renames and deletes are silently propagated as well.  If a locally changed file has also been changed at the server, then UI is available on the client to choose either the local version or the server version of the file. (How is client able to decide which to use?)  Push back happens when CSC decides it should happen (presuming the cached file is currently closed), conflicts remain unresolved until UI intervention occurs.  It is important to realize that inter-client sharing of files on cacheable shares will not work as expected.  Sometimes operations will flow to the server, and sometimes they won t.  Whether or not they flow depends on whether or not a particular client has a fully cached image of the file; Win32 programs have no control over this behavior. CSC does not cache directories, but it does create a cached directory entry for files that are locally cached.  For instance, if a server directory contains files   and  , but only   is locally cached on the client, then the disconnected client will see only   in an enumeration of the directory. Non-Cacheable Shares The CSC logic is used as a performance enhancement for server shares that are not marked cacheable.  The server and share must be available; and opens, locks, directory enumerations, and writes flow to the server as today.  When appropriate, the client captures data in a local persistent cache file and suppresses reads to the server if it has at least a level 2 oplock   hence the client experiences a performance improvement for read-intensive applications under certain conditions.  Inter-client sharing and per-file cache coherency behavior is as today. There is an API, and corresponding UI, to force CSC to cache files from a server, even if the server and share are not marked cacheable.  These files are marked as pinned. Files so cached enjoy the performance speedup, and these files are also available if the client is disconnected from the network (or if the server is otherwise unavailable).  It is important to note that any application operating from such a cached file while disconnected does not enjoy typical inter-client sharing access checks, nor are the contents of the cached copy of the file or directory coherent with other clients.  Inward propagation and push back are completely manual in this case when reconnected to the network. Local Cache Management The client side cache is of finite size , and CSC silently evicts files from its cache as required.  There are APIs to suppress eviction on a file-by-file basis; such suppression is called pinning a file to the cache.  There is a PinCount maintained for each cached file, the default value for PinCount is zero.  Only files having a PinCount of zero can be evicted from the cache.  Each pin request increments PinCount by one, each unpin request decrements PinCount by one.  CSC by itself never pins or unpins files. The data that has not been pinned is added up to check whether the disk reservation for CSC has been exceeded. In other words the disk reservation refers only to the space allocated to the unpinned files; pinned files are treated as if the user copied them manually. CSC must be aware of DFS alternates, and rely on the fact that some (completely independent) agent is keeping DFS alternates in sync.  CSC can select any of the DFS alternates for file put-back and/or cache filling. Win32 Considerations Aside from the cache pin management APIsAPIs described above, CSC introduces no new Win32 APIs.  However there are two changes of note to existing APIs: As discussed above, no inter-client file sharing is possible for cached files.  Programs on separate client computers can open the "same" locally cached file in conflicting sharing modes.  Programs within an individual client computer obey normal file sharing and cache coherency rules. The win32 semantics fails only in the obvious case where the user is disconnected from the net. When in disconnected mode, locally cached files need to return some new attribute bit during Win32 find first/find next.  This is to support a presumed need by the UI to quickly discover that we are operating on a cached copy of the file rather than the live copy of a file on a server. Link Speed Considerations CSC must take akes appropriate measures to conserve the network bandwidth, in cases where the network connection is over a slow link. Inward/outward propagation will happen much more lazily than is the case with LAN.  Most of the slow link heuristic  is included in the CSC sync handler which is part of the cscui.dll. Server Side Settings RemoteBoot/AppInstall considerations 1) APIs specially for remote boot a) Disable/Enable CSC API for remote boot This is needed to allow a user to boot without CSC. The API already exists, indeed RB uses it to turn on CSC. It should not call it when it  when the user wants to boot off of the network. b) Mark a remote boot directory as pinned with all it s descendents automatically pinned A usermode API is being provided in cscdll.dll and the corresponding IOCTL already exists. The functionality of pinning new files in a pinned folder is yet to be implemented and is  simple to implement. c) UNC to CSC database filemapping routine This is needed during booting when the normal file APIs don t work. One of the RB devs should implement OpenFileLocal and ReadFileLocal APIs in the oslayer.h, others may stay empty. A library similar to umreclib (rdr2\csc\record.mgr) should be created and linked in to the appropriate exe.  There will be an API in record.c which will use these two routines to return the local file name, given a UNC path. Recovering from a disk crash  The issues to address are a) How do boot files get populated in CSC and b) How are they pinned. Boot files get poulated when the loader discovers that there are no files with which to boot and goes into a textmode RB setup phase. This is similar to setting up RB for the first time.  Having setup RB, the GUI mode connects to the RB share, then before touching any files ) marks the RB share as boot share in the local database and also pins it with flags FLAG_CSC_BOOT_SHARE | FLAG_CSC_PIN_HIERARCHICAL | FLAG_CSC_PIN_SYSTEM.  All subsequent file opens would create entries in the CSC database with a pincount of 1 and FLAG_CSC_PIN_SYSTEM set. The issue of how the run-from-source apps are pinned is done by darwin. Following is how it is supposed to be done form what I understand during my discussions with Eric Flo and David Gonzalez. 1) When an app is published on the server, an advertisement script is created for that app which is kept in the Group Policy Template (GPT).  2) At user logon, winlogon goes to GPT and runs all the advertisement scripts for the user. 3) The advertisement script ends up calling darwin and the two together setup/ensure that all the advertisements already exist. The advertisements point to Darwin. Darwin maintains a database of apps that have been setup on this machine. 4) When the user clicks on an advertisement setup by winlogon, darwin kicks in and verifies in it's database whether the app is already installed or not. If it isn't already setup, darwin runs setup for that app, and on a successful setup makes an entry in it's database that the app is setup. If the app is already setup, Darwin invokes it. - When a users' disk tanks, darwins' local database is empty for the new disk. Thus when the nexttime winlogon runs and steps 1 to 3 happen, the advertisements get reestablished on the users machine. - As per my discussions with David Gonzalez and Eric Flo, there is this additional step of setup that the logon code would go through when it discovers from Darwin that this is a new database. Pinning happens as a consequence of the setup. It is not clear whether we want to do automatically run setup or let the user do it again. David Kays owns dealing with issue. From appsetup standpoint, recovering pin state isn t the main issue of getting apps back after the dsik tanks and a new one is installed. Beyond this if any customers of CSC want to know whether they are starting fresh, CSC can tell them through an API, as CSC knows whether it started from a clean database or not. Avoiding network traffic on shares from which booting and app execution happens Four different types of settings are recognized by NT5 clients as per the SMB protocol modifications noted above. These are 1) Share enabled for manual caching 2) Share enabled fro autocaching for documents 3) Share enabled for autocaching for programs 4) Share has persistent caching disabled - Share marked  for  Manually Caching When no explicit setting is made on a share, it is enabled for manual caching. This means that files from this share are cached when they are explicitly pinned by calling the CSC pinning API. It should be noted that this is the only option for NT4/NT35x and win9x shares. - Share marked for auto-caching documents When this state is set on an NT5 share, all document opened from that share are cached. All the intervening directories are also cached. Thus if a share \\foo_share\bar_auto  is marked for auto-caching and a file   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_share\\bar_doc\\dir1\\dir2\\xxx.txt  \\foo_share\bar_doc\dir1\dir2\xxx.txt  is opened, then all the namespace components up to xxx.txt namely   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_share\\bar_auto  \\foo_share\bar_auto , dir1, dir2 and xxx.txt are cached. Moreover, the contents of xxx.txt are brought down lazily in the background.   - Share marked for auto-caching programs A special status bit must be set/available on a This state is set on an NT5 share from which booting occurs and remote apps are run. For such shares, CSC will try to conserve the net bandwidth to the maximum possible extent. This is done by not flowing opens to the serverfor files which have been recently refreshed for files which are opened for execution. The CSC database will maintain a last refresh time on each file. The time is set on create and changed every time the file is refreshed. For files on these special shares, the redir will use the local copy if either it has been modified locally or it is not spares and it s last refresh time is is within a  certain freshness delta  (to be done through a registry setting). If the file is not sparse and is not locally modified and it s freshness delta has expired, then in connected mode, the redir will issue a Get File Attribute call to the server, check if the file has changed, it will flow the open if it has and truncate the local copy. If the file has not changed, then the redir will update the last refresh time of the entry and use the local copy. All name space modification operations such as create, rename and delete will flow to the serever. This ensures that when connected, the local namespace is in ssync with the remote namespace. Thus FindFirst//FindNext show up the correct items when connected.  This allows applications to be deployed from a share,  and if the clients as NT5 workstations, then the load on the server hosting these applications is substantially reduced because there are no outstanding file-opens at the server. - Share disabled for persistent caching When an NT5 share sets this state, the clients using this share, disallow persistent caching from this share.  This setting is meant for shares which are used for database type applications. DFS integration CSC ensures that the namespace that it caches is the namespace as seen by the applications. This is an issue only in cases where a  directory on a share is a DFS junction point and has multiple alternates. Thus if   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_share\\bar_dfs  \\foo_share\bar_dfs  has a directory dir_junc, which is a DFS junction point for alternate shares   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_alt\\bar_alt1  \\foo_alt1\bar , then the namespace cached on the client is still   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_share\\bar_dfs\\dir_junc  \\foo_share\bar_dfs\dir_junc . This ensures that the disconnected mode operation works on the name that the user sees in connected mode.   HYPERLINK    HYPERLINK    HYPERLINK   Security Considerations There is a single CSC database per client machine. On the client database, CSC maintains information on every file and a every share for multiple using them, in order to implement per-user semantics. When a file is cached during connected mode, the maximal rights for the user opening the file are also cached with that file. Moreover, the maximal rights for a guest user are also cached. This allows CSC to emulate access rights in disconnected mode. For files that are created in disconnected mode, CSC stamps the access rights as stored on the share in the CSC database on to the newly created file. Encrypted files are excluded from auto caching.  When the CSC database is hosted on NTFS, all the database files are stamped with administrative ACLS in order to protect access to the database and locally cached files. Offline Operation  The SMB redirector The policy of when and how often to do flush is left to onestop. OneStop will end up issuing appropriate csc APIs at  appropriate times , such as logon, logoff, idle time etc. While merging a share, the namespace modification operations on that share will be disabled in order for the merge to get a consistent snapshot of the emulates a server in offline when the following conditions are true namespace. CSC is enabled on the client machine There is at least one share for that server for which files/directories have been cached While attempting perform operations on the server, an error was returned which unambiguously indicates that the server is not available, either because it is down, or some intervening router is down, or the client machine has no net access. When the above conditions are met, the entire server operates as if it is disconnected mode.  It is important to note that online/offline property is on a per-server basis as against a per-share basis. Thus if the redirector received an error while accessing a share   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_server\\bar_share  \\foo_server\bar_share , then if the conditions a) and b) above are met, the server   HYPERLINK \\\\foo_server  \\foo_server  is transitioned to offline state.  This affects offline operations in various ways, one example being that even if only one share is inaccessible, the entire server is put into offline state. Moreover when running off a DFS share, all accesses to the alternates are also automatically transitioned to offline. A Tactical Step for NT5.0 (Shishir) It is possible to take a step in this direction through CSC functionality, which comes close to the above description of CSC but makes a slightly more conservative tradeoff between scalability and consistency. In this mode of operation CSC marked share only indicates a license to cache files based on fileopens. Files on shares not marked as CSC get in the persistent cache only if explicitly pinned using a UI mechanism. This is the same as described above. The main difference comes in the way opens flow to the CSC marked shares. File opens do not flow to the server if the files are opened either in read-only mode, or in deny write-sharing mode. Files are opened on the server only in case of open and sharing modes where the client intends to write data to the file. In such a situation, the CSC works like a writethrough cache. This mode operation ensures that a) for CSC usage scenarios where most of the files are opened in read-only or deny_write mode, such as the remote_boot, the server bandwidth is conserved. b) For files that are opened for writing, win32 semantics is not compromised when the user is connected to the net. Putback is needed only in situation where the user has been running in disconnected mode and has modified data in this mode.  This avoids the situation where in connected state more bandwidth is consumed for put back as whole files have to written back even when a small portion of the file is changed. The principal advantage seen in this mode of function is User will be more willing to under stand about conflicts when he has been working in disconnected mode, as he is made aware of this mode of operation through some UI means. When connected, the win32 semantics is preserved when the client intends to write to a file on the share. CSC conformant behavior on part of the client brings substantial caching benefit. Thus bandwidth is preserved in cases when the client does the correct kind of opens. This makes it possible to run all executable modules entirely locally yet, have the most up to date state on the server. Open Issues, Questions, etc.. What happens if the user supplies credentials at  net use  time, and then pins some files?  How does reconciliation happen? Pinning Pinning is a  means by which applications tell CSC to make a file in the persistent cache immune to scavenging.  The scenarios of this API are a) App Installers pin specific files in the cache b) User pins a file in the cache through shell  context menu. There are two ways to think about pinning  a file is pinned in the persistant cache by some application  a file is pinned in the persistent cache by a specific application. The API presents the picture as in b) but for v1 it behaves is as per a). In other words, pinning works in the same way as if the user made an xcopy of the file, irrespective of how many times the xcopy was done. PinItem( IN LPTSTR lpName, // Name of the item IN GUID *pGuid, // application ID OUT LPDWORD lpdwStatus, // status bits of the file/directory IN DWORD dwReserved // reserved for future extension This API allows an application to pin a file/directory  in the Client-Side-Cache.  Parameters: lpName:  A fully qualified  UNC name of the item to be cached.  pGuid: GUID representing the caller. This parameter is ignored in this version, and can be NULL lpdwStatus: if non-NULL, returns various status bits of the cached item dwReserved:  reserved for future use Return Value: The function returns TRUE if successful. The status bits indicate more information about the item in the cache.  If the function fails, FALSE is returned. GetLastError() can be called to get extended information about the error. UnpinItem( IN LPTSTR lpName, // Name of the file or directory IN GUID *pGuid, // application ID OUT LPDWORD lpdwStatus, // status bits of the file/directory IN DWORD dwReserved // reserved for future extension This API allows  the caller to unpin a file/directory from the client side persistent cache. Parameters: lpName:  A fully qualified  UNC name of the item to be unpinned pGuid: GUID representing the caller. This parameter is ignored in this version, and can be NULL lpdwStatus: if non-NULL, returns various status bits of the cached item Possible bits are: CSC_FLAG_NOT_PINNED 0x00000001 The item is not pinned in the cache CSC_FLAG_PARTIALLY_CACHED 0x00000002 The item is partially cached dwReserved:  reserved for future use Return Value: The function returns TRUE if successful. The status bits indicate more information about the item in the cache.  If the function fails, FALSE is returned. GetLastError() can be called to get extended information about the error.  If the cached file is from a share marked CSC_FLAGS_CACHEABLE and not CSC_FLOWOPS, then the client should not require a level 2 oplock.   This is a registry setting, expressed as percent of disk space.  The period applies to all server and share combinations, and can be set in the client s registry to multiples of 30 minute intervals.  The period applies to all server and share combinations, and can be set in the client s registry to multiples of 30 minute intervals.  This is intentionally vague to ensure that nobody explicitly builds code that depends on any particular propagation behavior.  A file is not updated by inward propagation if it is currently open on the client.

The database is organized as a tree structure. The root-node of the tree(henceforth referred to as the super-root) contains a list of shares that have been successfully connected in the past. Each entry in the this list points to the root directory of that share. A node in the tree is either a directory node or a file node, the latter always being a leaf node.  Each node in the tree is uniquely identified by a 32 bit number called the Inode. All inodes are part of an inode table, which also does double duty as a priority queue. Moreover, given an Inode it is possible to obtain the fully qualified UNC path which represents the Inode. As an implementation detail, each inode is nothing but an index in the inode table. Each node in the database is represented by a file. The files are named by converting their Inode number to an 8 hex-digit ASCII value and are in a well know directory. The super root is 00000001 while the Inode table is 00000002. The directory inode files contain the information about  the children of that directory., in the form of a sequence of directory entries as described in DE below. The file inode files contain the actual contents of the file.  Inode table entry  notation  An inode I is represented as I(IP, S, IC, FOI, all other attributes) as follows 32 bit parent Inode # - for the root if a share, this value is 0 Contents associated with the inode. For a file this the entire file data. For a directory this  is the set of directory entries. Inode Attribute (Enumerated type) -       OI stands for original  Inode. Indicates that the contents of this  inode  originally came from the net and is in use. UOI, stands for Unassociated Original Inode LI, stands for Local Inode. This has the content created offline. NB: There is no such thing as an ULI, ie: Unassociated Local Inode. Other Information - Sync Status, duplicated for the sake of the agent - UI information (See the directory entry below) - forward and backward pointers pointing to other inodes forming a  doubly linked MRU list.  These entries are used in deciding which entries to scavenge if the CSC database grows beyond a prespecified disk quota. Directory entry notation: An entry with the name   in a directory represented by inode IP is represented as <IP,  >(Current Inode, Sync Status, Original Inode, RenameFrom Inode, All Other Attributes)  Current Inode The inode that currently has the contents of this entry Synchronization Status Status  (bit field) S - Sparse This bit is set only for server objects. Files are marked sparse when the contents L - created offlline Object which is created while in disconnected state D - marked as deleted An object is marked deleted when it is obtained from the  Server or currently has directory contents from a directory on  the server R - reused  An object from the server that is marked deleted and is  recreated DM - Data modified offline (Cannot coexist with L above) An object from the server whose data has gone through some  Change while offline AM - An object whose attributes have gone through some change while  Offline. This includes, directory attribbutes and last modified  Original Inode: The Inode which represents the contents cached from the server.  For a replica, the The Current Indoe and the Original Inode are Identical when the entry has not gone through a namespace operation while  offline All Other Attributes Last Modified Time from the server Used to detect conflicts UI Information Whether the entry is pinned for a user Whether the entry is pinned for system Pin count when an entry is pinned for neither user nor system Filesystem Attributes:  (referred to as FA, as a group) Name(s): Both LFN and 8.3 names Filesystem Attributes:  filesystem attributes last modified time Security Attributes Per user maximal access rights for N user. The current value of N is 4. Other Notations: t care. ie. the contents of the field are immaterial denotes a non-exitent Inode Empty denotes 0 sized contents of an Inode inidcates no flags set indicates a value of any of the above types that needs to be retained while carrying out a transformation Parent Inode of I Namespace Operations: There are four possible modes of operations of the redir with respect to CSC, depending the type of the share that is being accessed. CSC disabled shares Under this mode, no caching is done for this share. Offline operations fail with appropriate errors. Explicit pinning is also disabled. Auto_Reintegration Shares Under this mode, while online, every file that is opened on the share is cached in the CSC database under it s namespace as found on the share.  It is OK to pin files. Any part of the namespace that has been marked as having been modified offline is invisible when offline. This situation can occur when the share went offline and modifications were done wither to file data or the namespace changed through create/delete/rename operations. Then when it went online, either no-reintegration was performed or all the modifications could not be reintegrated. While online the redir operates as if the CSC database were a write-through cache. This is the  truth is on the server  mode of operations. The remote and the local copes are opened for files in sync, read operations are satisfied locally, while write operations are done on the server and on the local file. Example of invisible namespace: if a file   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\foo.txt  that was cached online and modified offline, did not get reintegrated, then when online this copy is not visible, only the server copy is. Non_Auto_Reintration shares The principal difference between this and Auto_reintgeration share is that files are not cached when they are opened. All other details remain the same. The fact that these are no_auto_reintegration shares means that UI needs to explicitly ask questions or invoke some other means of bringing the user in the loop while doing reintegration. VDO shares The files under these shares get cached when opened. For those files that are fully cached in the database, the files opened locally and all operations are satisfied locally. This is the  truth is on the client  mode. What follows is a description of how the namespace operations are performed  by CSC. The operations are described in the notation defined above. They are split into two types a) Online and b) Offline.  When online, a name that has been created/modified/marked-deleted while offline and not successfully integrated is made invisible during online operations.  The operations below describe the namespace operations. VDO shares operate in offline mode for files fully cached and in online mode for files not fully cached. IRenameFrom and IORG elements of the data structure make it possible to translate the localname into the remote name and vice-versa. Lookup: Given a fully qualified UNC path such as \\server\share\dir1\dir2..\dirn\file1, The path is broken down item by item to find the Inode that represents the item in the hierarchy. This \\server\share are looked up in the super-root, and the root Inode corresponding to \\server\share is found.  Henceforth we will refer to the root inode corresponding to any share as I0. Given I0 (say 0x10), find the inode file corresponding to I0 (00000010), run through the list of  DEs in this file matching dir1 in the above example and obtain the Inode corresponding to dir1 I1. Traverse I1 to look for the name dir2 and so on till the name file1 is obtained from In. Create Operations Online: Create a replica of remote item   under a directory represented by IP - Create IORG(IP, Empty, OI, X) - Create <IP, >(IORG, 0, IORG, X) Offline: a) Create a new item   in offline state under the directory represented by IP - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) - Create <IP,  >(I, L, I, X) b) Create a new item which is of the same name as a server item marked deleted: - Create I(IP, Empty, LI, X) <IP,  , D, IORG, X) => <IP, >(I, R, IORG, X) delete I Delete Operation Online: Delete a replica of   from directory represented by IP If the server operation succeeds and the database entry and all it s ancestors are in sync with the server then - delete <IP,  >(IORG,0,IORG,NULL,X) - delete IORG(IP,0,X,OI,X) - delete contents of IORG Offline: a) Delete a replica of an item   from directory represented by IP 1) <IP,  >(IORG, 0, IORG, X)    => <IP, >(NULL, D, IORG, X) 2) IORG(IP,  X,OI, X)  => IORG(IP, Empty, UOI, X) Truncate the contents of the inode IORG if foo is a file. If foo is a directory, then we want to keep the contents of IORG, which are the directory entries of foo cached from the server. Comments: Associate a NULL inode with <IP, >,  note the original contents in IORG field and mark the entry  D (deleted). Mark the Inode which represents the original contents as Unassociated Origianl Inode. b) Delete   created in offline state in directory IP.  Delete <IP,  >(I, L, I, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) c) Delete   reused in offline state in directory IP.  <IP,  >(I, R, IORG, X) => <IP,  >(NULL, D, IORG, X) Delete <IP,  >(I, L, L, 0) If  I is marked LI, delete I Else it must be marked OI, do I(X, X, OI, X) => I(X, X, UOI, X) Rename Rename item   in directory IP1 to item   in directory  Online: - Save all the attributes of foo - Delete <IP1,  foo>(I,V,V,V) - Create <IP2,  >(I,V,V,V)  - I(IP1,V,V, V) => I(IP2,V,V, V) Offline: -      Save all the attributes of  <IP1,  Execute offline delete of foo as done above, except for any Original Inode and it s content Execute offline Create of bar with all the attributes of foo, including it s inode Reintegration The reintegartion of a share is a 3 pass operation, the passes being  Remove all the files/directories from the server that have been deleted and renamed  when offline to a holding directory.  This step essentially remove the elements from the server name space which after a successfull reintegration should not be there. Create elemnts on the server corresponding to the new namespace that is generated while offline. Restore the state on the database and the server, based on the conflicts encountered. Initialization: Create a temporary  directory on the server(say reint). This directory is our holding directory for various files/directories. Create two conflict lists, OriginalConflictList and CurrentConflictList.  Pass 1: Starting from the root of a share, do a depth first traversal of the original tree. This is done by traversing  the  IORG inode of a directory. Only the directories which are replicas of a directory on the server will have this entry. While traversing the original tree in a depth first manner, for all entries which are either marked D (deleted) or R (Reused), ie. entries of the type <IP1, >(X, D, IORG, X) or  <IP1, foo>(X, R, IORG, X).        - Accumulate the original UNC path as obtained from the original tree in the CSC database. In depth first order, ie. leaf first then it s immediate parent then it s parent etc.,  If there is no conflict between the version of the replica and the server copy If it is marked D or R (deleted offline, or deleted offline and then later reused) If the IORG is marked as Unassociated Original Inode (UOI), then this entry has been deleted and it s contents have been deleted (may be through a simple delete or one or more renames followed by a delete).  If Delete of the entity on the server succeeds or this is a directory, in which case the failure to delete is treated as benign conflict. Delete the entry from the database Delete the IORG inode Delete the contents associated with IORG. Else this must have been renamed to some other entry do a rename on the server of the file/directory with the accumulated UNC path to the temp directory on the server,  the new name being the same as that of the IORG entry. This ensures no name collision in the temp directory, as the inodes are unique. Let us call the name in the temporary directory ASCII(IORG), for the item with IORG as the original Inode, on the server that has been renamed to ASCII equivalent of it's Inode name in the temp directory.  If there is a conflict, ie. the file/directory on the server is newer than the one in the CSC database, or an operation fails, attach the original UNC name together with  it s current  Inode to the head of conflict list we call the OriginalConflictsList. We use this in pass two to find if any newly created entries are conflicting, and in pass 3 to restore the saved entries back into the original namespace. This ensures that, all the files and directories which are supposed to either have been deleted from the server, or are renamed to some other file/directory while offline, are removed from the server namespace. We have the copies of those files/directories which got renamed, into the temp directory and will use these when we get to pass 2. Example:  If for the UNC path   HYPERLINK \\\\server1\\share1\\dir1\\dir2\\foo.txt  \\server1\share1\dir1\dir2\foo.txt  as obtained by traversing the original tree of the CSC database,  <IP1,  foo.txt >(X, X, IORG1, X)  IORG1(X, X, UOI, X) and <IP2,  , R, IORG2, X)        IORG2(X, X, OI, X) Then delete foo.txt on the server then rename dir1 to ASCII(IORG2) Pass 2: Starting from the root, traverse the current tree in the CSC database, thus for a directory <IP1,  >(I, X, X, X), traverse I, while accumulating the UNC path up to I For every entry that is marked L, R, M, IE. it is either  created offline due to create/rename or  is a replica that has gone through a delete/create or rename/create cycle while offline or  is a replica whose contents have been modified offline in some way. So if it is a file, it s data /attributes/timestamps have been modified while offline, or if it is a directory, some entries have been added/deleted or attributes/timestamps of the directory have been modified while offline) the entry is marked L or R and the Inode is marked OI,  <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, OI, X) Then this is a new entry created offline from the contents of an Original Inode (through one or more renames). Check in the Original Conflicts list whether there is an entry corresponding to I. If there is no conflict,  Then there must be an item ASCII(I) on the server, rename that entry to the accumulated UNC name. If the rename operation fails, then attach the entry to the list we call CurrentConflictList. Note that this is a second conflict list which is different from the OriginalConflictList. The CurrentConflictList has UNC names that correspond to the current namespace if all reintegration had succeeded. If the rename operation succeeds then Convert the new entry to a replica using the following transformation <IP1,  >(I, L, NULL, X) => <IP1,  >(I, 0, I, X) stamp it with the timestamp from the entry from the server. Else  it exists in the conflict list, we cannot reintegrate this entry, ignore it and all it s descendents.  Else if it is marked L or R and the Inode is marked LI IE it is represented as <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) I(X, X, LI, X) Then this represents a new name and new content. Create it.  If create succeeds <IP,  >(I, {L | R}, X, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) I(X, X, LI, X) => I(X, X, OI, X) ignore all it s descendents Else if it is marked as D Ignore it, it must be in the conflicts list or else it would have been taken care of in pass 1 Else if it is marked M IE the contents of a remote entry have been modified offline; it is represented by <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) I(IP, X, OI, X) Modify it on the server If modification succeeds  Remove the marking M from the entry IE <IP,  >(I, M, I, X) => <IP,  >(I, 0, I, X) ignore all it s descendents Note: The problem of cross-linked remote entries is side stepped because of the way renaming is accomplished during reintegration. Pass 3:  This is a cleanup pass. The key cleanup we do here is to remove those entries that have been renamed to some other entries. In pass 2, the renamed entries have already been associated to the appropriate contents. Traverse the original tree ( we could also traverse the current tree as it is a superset of the original tree) for every entry that is marked as D or R and the IORG is marked as OI,  If IORG is not in the ConflictList then it has been assigned to some other name Delete the directory entry while keeping the inode. Traverse the OriginalConflictList from it s head to tail and rename back all the entries from the temporary directory to their original UNC names as maintained in the OriginalConflictsList. Delete the temp directory itself. {xuro |yvspmjb }ume]U

1. i don't get the hint stuff at all.

2. metamatch just seems to be a basic enumeration capability....somehow, it seems that it was originally tied
   into the ifsmgr's metamatch stuff. so far, i haven't needed it.

3. there are numerous issues that are solved by having the correct critical section. i need to be making sure
   that i take it. there should be asserts all over the place about it.

1. the rule on the pagingio resource is that you have to take it exclusive if you are shrinking
the file of if you are wrapping. otherwise you can take it shared. fat just cycles thru 16
resources that it shared with hpfs; initially, we will do the same....later we may change to a
resource per fcb in the same way as rdr1 and ntfs.

This short note will potentially explain the states and transitions
available on an FCB complex. For those just tuning in, a fileobject (FO)
refers to an FCB (File Control Block) and an FOBX (File Object
Extension). There is a 1-1 correspondence between FOs and FOBXs. Many
FOs may/will refer to the same FCB which represents a single file
somewhere on some server. A client may have several different opens
(NtCreates) on the same FCB and each of these will create a new file
object. What is interesting is that the rdr may choose to send fewer
SMBcreates than it receives NtCreates in effect sharing a server-open
(SVROPEN) among several FOBXs.

Another interesting tidbit is that the rdr doesn't necessarily close its
SRVOPENs when the user opens close hoping that it can reuse the open and
the data without any contact with the server. We say that an FCB is
client-side-open (CSO) if there are user opens openstanding on the FCB.
It is server-side-open is there are existing SRVOPENs on the FCB. From
all of this, the following table explains what can happen on a user open
(assuming the netroot is good):

   Create?  CS-Open?   SS-Open?    Action
   -----------------------------------------
     Yes      Open      Open       ERROR
              Open     Closed      IMPOSSIBLE
             Closed     Open       CloseAllSrvOpens();NewOpen()
             Closed    Closed      NewOpen()
     No       Open      Open       NotSharable()-->NewOpen()
              Open     Closed      IMPOSSIBLE
             Closed     Open       NotSharable()-->NewOpen()
             Closed    Closed      NewOpen()

Thus, it actually boils down to a pretty simple scheme:

        (Create && CS-Open) ==> return ERROR;
        (Create && SS-Open && !CS-Open) ==> CloseAllSrvOpens();
        (NotShareable()) ==> return NewOpen();
        return SharableOpen();


A careful review here shows us what must happen on cleanup:
specifically, we must do whatever it takes to cleanup the clientside as
appropriate.  Further, if the open is the last user open and
DELETE-ON-CLOSE or TRUNCATE-ON-CLOSE are operative, then we must drive
the FCB into the CLOSED/CLOSED state; otherwise, we may elect to leave
SRVOPENs open even if there are no current opens.  Since the subrdr is
the best judge of whether closing or keeping is appropriate, we call
down on the transition (SRXSrvOpenTransitioningToClosed).  When the
subrdr gets this call, it may elect to (a) close the current SRVOPEN,
(b) close SRVOPENs with no associated user opens, (c) do nothing and
rely on the RDBSS to call down for real closes at the correct time.

If the subrdr chooses to allow the SRVOPEN to remain, the RDBSS will
take some steps close ones that remain according to some criteria that
(a) haven't been worked out yet and (b) need to be very flexible.
Probably this will be another calldown (SRXClosedSrvOpenTimeOut).  The
same is true of the FCB itself....after some reasonbale period, it and
the cached data (if any) that it represents should be finalized.
Another pair of calldowns (i.e.  SRXFcbTransitioningToClosed and
SRXClosedFcbTimeOut).

So, the following sums it up for cleanup:

(Delete||Truncate)&&LastCSOpenPerFcb => CloseAllSrvOpens();
ELSE  LastCSOpenPerSrvOpen => SRXSrvOpenTransitioningToClosed();
ELSE (we'll do it on a timer)

Notice that if the subrdr wants to do something aggressive like close
the srvopen and finalize, then it will have to take out the appropriate
locks itself. The RDBSS isn't going to take the locks just so the subrdr
can say "no, thx". Currently, we uninitialize the cachemap as well and
count on the winding down logic of CM/MM to keep the map open for some
time....we will consider later forcing the CM to stay open (for example,
by putting our own reference on the fileobject).

1) Copy rdbss.sys and mrxsmb.sys to system32\drivers directory.

2) copy the .ini/.bat files to the directory of your choice from the appropriate
   sub directory SUR/CAIRO.

3) run setup.bat -- This initializes the registry.

3) Reboot the system. The system will come up with the new rdr. The new rdr will be
active as long as it is correctly loaded / unloaded. If the new redirector
fails the workstation service switches over to the old redirector. In order
to switch over to the new redirector run the following command and reboot
        regini rdr2.ini

NOTE: Under Cairo the reboot is required because DFS keeps the Redirector
device open. Under SUR this in conjunction with net start/stop rdr toggles
between the old and the new one.

4) For CAIRO in order to switch to the old redirector use the following
   commands ..

   regini rdr.ini
   regini rdrdfs.ini

   and reboot.

   Similarly for the new redirector use the following commands

   regini rdr2.ini
   regini rdr2dfs.ini

   and reboot.

Display and Alter the Compression of Files or Directories


The COMPACT tool compresses files on an NTFS drive.

Usage: 

COMPACT [/C | /U] [/S[:dir]] [/A] [/I] [/Q] [filename [...]]

/C       Compresses the specified directory or file.
/U       Uncompress the specified directory or file.
/S       Performs the specified operation on matching files in the
         given directory and all subdirectories. Default "dir" is 
         the current directory.
/A       Do not ignore hidden or system files.
/I       Ignore errors.
/F       Force the operation to compress or uncompress the 
         specified directory or file.
/Q       Be less verbose.
filename Specifies a pattern, file, or directory.

When used without parameters, COMPACT displays the compression state of the 
current directory. You may use multiple filenames and wildcards.

Building NT fdisk's boot code
                    -----------------------------


    The master boot code is contained in the file x86mboot.c, which is
#include'd into fd_nt.c.  The boot code is in the form of an array
(named x86BootCode) of unsigned chars, which is refered to by code in
fd_nt.c when fdisk needs to lay boot code on the disk.

    The x86mboot.c file is generated by different means depending on the
compilation host (ie, whether you're building on x86 or MIPS).


The following applies to x86 ONLY:
----------------------------------

    The master boot code is built from the x86mboot.asm and x86mboot.msg
files in i386 by running masm386 over these files to produce x86mboot.obj.

Then link_60 is run over x86mboot.obj to produce x86mboot.com. The boot code
is at offset 1280 in this file (1280 = 600h-100h.  600h is where the boot
code is assembled, and 100h is where a .com file is loaded by DOS.)  It is
of length 0x1be (512 byte sector - 64-byte partition table - signature word).

The tool bin2c.exe (in sdktoosl) is run over x86mboot.com to generate
i386\x86mboot.c.


The following applies to MIPS ONLY:
-----------------------------------

    On MIPS, the best we can do is check in the 'finished' product of the
x86 process, namely x86mboot.c, into the mips directory (we cannot run
masm386 or link_60 on MIPS!).  If, however, the i386\x86mboot.asm or .msg
files are newer than mips\x86mboot.c, then that means that someone changed
the boot code but did not check in the .c file to mips\x86mboot.c.  So we
generate an error message.

The correct action when receiving this error message is to go to an x86
machine, bget or build the i386\x86mboot.c file, and check that file
into mips\x86mboot.c.  Then sync on the MIPS machine.






    Our build process generates a -I parameter to the compiler based on
the compilation environement (ie, -Imips\ or -Ii386\).  This allows fdisk
to simply '#include "x86mboot.c"' and get either the generated file on x86
or the file under source control for MIPS.  This way we maintain at least
a semblance of the correct dependencies should the x86mboot.msg file be
translated, etc.

Introduction 1.1 What Is Performance Monitoring Performance monitoring is a feature introduced in the Pentium processor. This feature allows counting of performance events through a set of model specific registers (MSRs). The information obtained can be used to optimize the performance of applications, system software and compilers. The event types that can be measured and the ways to measure them are processor dependent.  Microsoft Windows Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs) support the Performance Monitoring for the Intel and Amd processors. This document only covers the HAL implementation on x86 and Amd64 platforms. 1.2. Overview of Performance Monitoring Implementations The performance monitoring mechanism is processor dependent and is not architectural. Listed below are the types of hardware implementations seen so far.  Pentium Processors Pentium processor provides one control and event select MSR (CESR) and two 40-bit performance counter MSRs (CTR0 and CTR1). There are 59 supported performance events. Two events can be monitored simultaneously. P6 Family Processors P6 family processors include Pentium Pro, Pentium II and III. The P6 family processors provide two 40-bit performance counters (PerfCtr0 and PerfCtr1) and two performance event select registers (PerfEvtSel0 and PerfEvtSel0). Compared with Pentium Processors, P6 s performance monitoring mechanism was enhanced to support a wider selection of events and with more flexible controls. Two events can be monitored simultaneously.  Pentium 4 and Xeon Pentium 4 and Xeon processors provide 45 event selection control registers (ESCR) MSRs, 18 performance counter MSRs, 18 counter configuration control (CCCR) MSRs, one IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR and one IA32_DS_AREA MSR. In addition to a new set of performance events and a better control over the way of monitoring, Pentium 4 and Xeon processors support advanced features like Precise Event-Based Sampling (PEBS) which provides finer granularity in event counting of at-retirement events.  Amd x86-64  The performance monitoring mechanism of x86-64 is similar to that of P6 family processors. The differences are: The number of performance counters and event select registers is extended to 4. The resolution of performance counter register is extended to 48-bit x86-64 supports its own set of performance events.  2. HAL Profiling Functions A set of HAL functions is provided to facilitate drivers or system software to count the performance events.  HalStartProfileInterrupt  HalStopProfileInterrupt HalSetProfileInterval HalSetSystemInformation HalQuerySystemInformation HalStartProfileInterrupt  HalStartProfileInterrupt ( IN KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource This function enables the monitoring of the hardware event specified by ProfileSource and setup registers to generate performance monitor interrupt (PMI) when the counter overflows. This routine must be called at PROFILE_LEVEL and is called on every processor. Parameters ProfileSource Indicates the source of the profiling.  Return Value HalStopProfileInterrupt  HalStopProfileInterrupt ( IN KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource This function disables the monitoring of the event associated with ProfileSource on current processor. This routine must be called at PROFILE_LEVEL and is called on every processor. Parameters ProfileSource Indicates the source of the profiling.  Return Value HalSetProfileInterval  ULONG_PTR HalStopProfileInterrupt ( IN ULONG_PTR Interval This function sets the interrupt interval for ProfileTime. Parameters Interval Supplies the desired profile interval in 100ns units. Return Value The actual profile interval. HalSetSystemInformation  NTSTATUS HalSetSystemInformation ( IN HAL_SET_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG BufferSize, IN PVOID   Buffer) This function sets HAL or OEM specific system information.  The type of information that is returned depends upon the InformationClass argument.  Parameters InformationClass Constant that describes the information pointed to by Buffer. BufferSize Size of the information pointed to by Buffer. Buffer HAL or OEM specific information described by InformationClass. Return Value STATUS_SUCCESS if the HAL successfully utilizes the information in Buffer. Comment We only cover the information related to performance monitoring here. When InformationClass is HalProfileSourceInterval, this function sets the interval for the specified profile source. The structure pointed by Buffer is defined as typedef struct _HAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INTERVAL {     KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource;     ULONG_PTR Interval; } HAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INTERVAL, *PHAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INTERVAL; When InformationClass is HalProfileSourceInterruptHandler, this function registers an interrupt handler, which is at the location pointed by buffer, for the performance-monitoring counter overflows. HalQuerySystemInformation  NTSTATUS HalQuerySystemInformation ( IN HAL_SET_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG  BufferSize, IN OUT PVOID   Buffer, OUT PULONG   ReturnedLength This function returns HAL or OEM specific information to the caller.  The type of information that is returned depends upon the InformationClass argument. Parameters InformationClass Constant that describes the information pointed to by Buffer. BufferSize Size of the information pointed to by Buffer. Buffer HAL or OEM specific information described by InformationClass. ReturnSize Number of bytes of the information returned at Buffer. Return Value STATUS_SUCCESS if the HAL successfully returned in requested information in Buffer. Comment  We only cover the information related to performance monitoring here. When InformationClass is set to HalProfileSourceInformation, the requested data is returned at location pointed by Buffer in the format of HAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INFORMATION.  typedef struct _HAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INFORMATION {     IN OUT KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource;     OUT BOOLEAN            Supported;     OUT ULONG              Interval; } HAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INFORMATION, *PHAL_PROFILE_SOURCE_INFORMATION; 3. Implementation Notes 3.1 ProfileTime On x86 and Amd64 platforms, ProfileTime is not counted by performance counters. We can use either Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) or other system timers to count the occurrences of time events. Timer interrupt is also separate from performance monitor interrupt (PMI). For APIC systems, there is a separate local APIC interrupt for TSC Timer and performance monitor interrupt (PMI) respectively.  Because of these reasons we handle ProfileTime separately from other profile sources at a few places. 3.2 Interface to MSRs A set of private interface functions is introduced as an effort to hide the hardware differences from upper layer of code. These interface functions translate the performance monitoring requests into a sequence of platform dependent operations, including programming MSR registers.  Here is a list of these functions. HalpPriofileInterface.InitializeProfiling HalpPriofileInterface.EnableMonitoring HalpPriofileInterface.DisableMonitoring  HalpPriofileInterface.SetInterval  HalpPriofileInterface.CheckOverflowStatus  HalpPriofileInterface.QueryInformation InitializeProfiling NTSTATUS InitializeProfiling (     VOID     ) This function does one time initialization of the performance monitoring registers and data structures. This function is called on every processor. EnableMonitoring NTSTATUS EnableMonitoring ( KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource This function enables the monitoring of the performance event specified by ProfileSource and set up MSRs to generate performance monitor interrupt (PMI) when the counter overflows. This routine is called at PROFILE_LEVEL on every processor. On Pentium 4 or Xeon this function does the following Select a performance counter to count the event specified by Source and an associated ESCR to select the events to be counted Set up an ESCR for the specific event to be counted. Set up the CCCR for the performance counter to be used to count the event, by selecting the chosen the ESCR and selecting the desired event filters. Set up the CCCR to generate a PMI when counter overflows. Enable the counter to begin counting. On P6 family processors and Amd s x86-64 this function does the following, Select a performance counter register to count the event  Initialize the selected counter register PerfCtr to its initial count Set up the associated PerfEvlSel register for the specific event to be counted and set EN flag and INT flag. DisableMonitoring DisableMonitoring ( KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource This function disables the monitoring of the hardware event specified by ProfileSource and disables associated performance monitor interrupt (PMI). This routine is called at PROFILE_LEVEL on every processor. On Pentium 4 or Xeon this function does the following Located the CCCR register assigned to the specified event Clear the enable flag and OVF_PMI flag of the CCCR register On P6 family CPU or Amd x86-64, this function does the following Located the PerfEvlSel register assigned to the specified event Clear the EN flag and INT flag of the PerfEvlSel register associated with the selected counter SetInterval NTSTATUS SetInterval ( KPROFILE_SOURCE ProfileSource IN OUT ULONG_PTR *Interval This function adjusts the current interval to specified value. The actual Interval value get used will return to the caller through the pointer Interval. Usually the 2s complement negative value of the integer pointed by Interval will be set the counter register. CheckOverflowStatus CheckOverflowStatus ( OUT POVERFLOW_STATUS pOverflowStatus This function find out the overflowed counters and returns the total number and a array of related profile sources to the caller in following structure. typedef struct _OVERFLOW_STATUS {     ULONG Number;     KPROFILE_SOURCE *pSource; } OVERFLOW_STATUS, *POVERFLOW_STATUS;  On Pentium 4 or Xeon this function will examine the OVL flag of CCCR registers. Record the profile sources associated with overflowed counters to a buffer.  The address of this buffer will be returned to the caller through pSource. On P6 family CPU or Amd x86-64, this function will examine the current value of active counter registers. If a value is less than the initial value of this counter, record the associated profile source to a buffer.  The address of this buffer will be returned to the caller through pSource. QueryInformation   NTSTATUS QueryInformation ( IN HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationType, IN ULONG BufferSize, IN OUT PVOID Buffer, OUT PULONG ReturnedLength This is private version of HalQueryInformation. It retrieves the information of specified profile sources.  (See HalQueryInformation in this document for more details). 4. Consideration of Future Works  Performance monitoring mechanism is processor specific. One of the problems today is that this processor dependent knowledge is built into applications. We need to provide a way for applications to retrieve this type of information automatically at run time. Typically a performance tool needs to Enumerate a list of supported profile sources. Retrieve the attributes of each profile source, such as its name, the default interval value and the range of interval setting etc. Find out the number and the dependencies of the profile sources that could be monitored at same time.  Applications could behave more intelligently if it is well informed of the status and cause of failures. The current Hal profile functions don t even have a return code when it start or stop the profiling.   Most processors support the counting of performance events selectively in kernel and/or user mode. We can add this feature to Hal and user API if needed. We need to save/restore performance monitoring MSRs at power state transactions.  mbZbRb gdaV; gd).+ hGSf& gc_W_crcS hGSf& vrnvnj hJSf& mi]TKB wsosososksk {tj{c{ :paV;

Interrupt Affinity Filter -- How it works:
==========================================

IntFiltr works by intercepting a specific PnP IRP that is passed to 
devices (IRP_MN_START_DEVICE).  

The filter looks at the (translated) resource list that is passed along 
with this IRP, and modifies the affinity mask (according to settings 
specified by the user) for any of the Interrupt resources in the device's 
resource list.  This modified IRP is then passed-on to lower drivers in 
the stack.  

As a result, lower drivers (which use entries in this resource list when 
setting up their ISRs) will get their ISRs installed only on the set of 
processors that the user has specified (via the IntFiltr configuration 
tool).  

The end result is that the APIC gets programmed to direct certain 
interrupts to certain subsets of the CPUs in the system (which can be 
verified by doing a "!ioapic" in the debugger).  

                    ------------------------------

NOTE: one of the main challenges in writing this filter was ensuring 
that it could be installed on _any_ device stack.

DESCRIPTION:
============
This Interrupt-Affinity Filter (IntFiltr) allows a user to change the 
CPU-affinity of the interrupts in a system.  

Using this utility, you can direct any device's interrupts to a specific 
processor or set or processors (as opposed to always sending interrupts to 
all the CPUs in the system).  Note that different devices _can_ have 
different interrupt-affinity settings.  This utility will work on any 
machine, regardless of what processor or interrupt controller or HAL is 
used.  

Obviously, this tool is only interesting for multi-processor machines.  



USAGE:
======
There are 2 things that must be done in order to use IntFiltr.  These are: 

(1) Install the filter [only needs to be done once per machine]
(2) Configure the filter [whenever you want to change settings]



1. Installing the IntFiltr
--------------------------
To install IntFiltr, complete the following steps:

(a) Copy intfiltr.sys to your %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers directory.
      [intfiltr.sys is located in the \Install subdirectory of this package]
(b) Update your registry to include the changes listed in intfiltr.reg
      To make these changes, you can just run 'regedit intfiltr.reg'.
      [intfiltr.reg is located in the \Install subdirectory of this package]
  

2. Configuring the IntFiltr
---------------------------
To configure IntFiltr, run intfiltr.exe (located in the \Config 
subdirectory of this package).  

First, highlight a device in the 'Devices' listbox.  Then you can use the 
'Add Filter' and 'Remove Filter' buttons to turn interrupt filtering on 
and off, respectively, for the selected device.  When IntFiltr is 
installed on a device, the string "InterruptAffinityFilter" will appear 
in the 'Upper Filters' listbox.  

You can use the 'Set Mask' button to set the CPU-affinity for the selected 
device's interrupts, or you can use the 'Delete Mask' button to remove a 
device's CPU-affinity mask from the registry.  Beware that if no 
CPU-affinity mask exists for a device, installing IntFiltr on a 
device will have no useful effect.  

The button marked "Don't Restart Device When Making Changes" is intended 
for advanced users.  You can use this button to change a device's filter 
settings without restarting the selected device.  Note that while this 
button is checked, any change you make will not take effect until the next 
time the device is restarted (which will usually not occur until the next 
reboot).  

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Although _all_ the machine's devices will appear in the 
'Devices' list, it only makes sense to install IntFiltr on top of devices 
that have interrupt resources.  To see which devices have interrupt 
resources, you can go into Device Manager and select View -> Resources By 
Type.

ThisThe HAL enables Machine Check Exception (MCE) reporting for all implementation defined errors.  2. Intel Pentium  Pro Processor Machine Check The mMachine cCheckl eException (MCE)MCE is processor exception 0x18h. The handler for Machine Check Exception is implemented as a task gate for maximum reliability of the exception handler..  The HAL provides a generic exception handler for all errors that cause an exception.  This handler reports the machine check exception code on the screen and causes the operating system to halt gracefully, reducing the possibility of persistent data corruption. In addition, the HAL also provides MCA specific interface that can be used by drivers to :to: rRead the MCA banks to detect anny error that diddoes not generate an exceptionMCE. One case where an error does not generate an any exception is if the bit controlling reporting of the machine check error for a specific bank (MCi_CTL.Eej) bit is turned offcleared. There are also some restartable errors that don t generate Machine Check Exception and are logged in the MCA banks. getObtain control (to possibly log errors to NVRAM) when the Machine Check exception handler getsis invoked by providing two callback routines - ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback Machine Check Exception Handling If the MCA exception handler detects only Intel Pentium  technology (style) MCE support on the platform, it does the following: If a MCA driver is registered with the HAL, call the MCA driver ExceptionCallback function providing the contents of P5_MC_ADDR and P5_MC_TYPE register values. This callback routine can log the register values in NVRAM and return. Call KeBugCheckEx() with the following 4 parameters to halt the system  Low  32 bits of P5_MC_TYPE MSR Always zero High 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR Low 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR Maybe we should describe the format of the bugcheck output on the screen? If MCA support (Pentium Pro processor) on the platform is detected, the exception handler determineschecks if the error is restartable. If not, it does the following: call the MCA Driver ExceptionCallback routine to give the MCA driver a chance to log the errors in NVRAM call KeBugCheckEx() with the following 4 parameters  to halt the system.  MCA Bank number that generated Machine Check exception Address field from MCi_ADDR MSR for this MCA bank High 32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for this MCA bank Low 32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for this MCA bank If the error is restartable, the exception handler requests the timer tick routine to queues a DPC which when called will reports the MCA bank error to the MCA Driver through the DpcCallback routine. 3. Intel Itanium  Processor Machine Check Machines checks, including Machine Check Aborts cause IA64 processor execution to vector to the Processor Abstraction Layer (PAL) PALE_CHECK code in the IA64 ISA.   HYPERLINK ""  When PALE_CHECK has finished processing, it passes control to the System Abstraction Layer (SAL) SAL_ENTRY code in the IA64 ISA, which in turn branches to the SAL MCA handler: SAL_CHECK.  Uncorrected machine checks refer to errors that cannot be corrected at PAL or SAL layers. These may still be fully or partially recoverable at the OS layer.  At that time, the control flow differs between corrected and uncorrected machine checks.  For corrected machine checks, the OS corrected error interrupt handlers will be invoked some time after returning to the interrupted process.  For uncorrected machine checks, SAL exposes an interface to register an OS_MCA callback. After validating this entry point, SAL_CHECK branches to it and provides the necessary information and conditionan Error Record that willo allow the OS to recover whenever possible. The amount of state information savedError Record passed by SAL is implementation-dependentmust comply, at a minimum, with the V3.0 SAL specification (January 2001), Appendix B,  Error Record Structures . The, implying that the HAL had to exposes interfaces for the OEMs to register a driver, and provides the Error Record to the driver. This enables the OEMs to assist  MCA handlers and to provide valid state information to these handlers so these might help the generic HAL MCA handler by attempting recovery of platform specific errors and maintaining the integrity of the platform.  For IA64 PAL, SAL and OS MCA handler s details, please refer to  HYPERLINK "http://www.intel.com/design/ia-64/manuals"  http://www.intel.com/design/ia-64/manuals TIn addition, the IA64 Reference HAL provides an MCA specific interface that can be used by drivers to: Register for delivery of an ExceptionCallback during non-corrected error processing. This callback returns an error severity value to the standard HAL OS_MCA, allowing OEM error recovery. The driver also registers a DpcCallback, which will be performed should the driver recover during ExceptionCallback processing. Register for delivery of two additional DpcCallback. These are delivered during corrected error processing for CPU Corrected errors and/or Platform corrected errors. Read the Error Records during DpcCallback processing.Read the MCA logs Obtain control when the Machine Check exception handler is invoked by providing two callback routines - ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback. The ExceptionCallback has also the capability of returning an error severity value to the standard HAL OS_MCA path to hint this path to continue or halt gracefully the platform. Machine Check Exception Handling After collecting the MCA log, the standard HAL MCA handler calls the MCA driver ExceptionCallback function providing the MCA record. This allows the MCA driver to process the log and makes appropriate consideration with regards to the stability of the system. This callback function returns to an error severity value to let the HAL know if it should consider the event as fatal, recoverable or corrected by the MCA driver. In case of a corrected event and if registered, the MCA driver DpcCallback is then called for asynchronous log collection by the driver. In case of an OS_MCA uncorrected event, the HAL calls KeBugCheckEx( ) with the bugcheck code MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION and the following 4 parameters to halt the system HAL IA64 MCA type, which values could be:  HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_ASSERT = 1, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_GET_STATEINFO  = 2, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_CLEAR_STATEINFO = 3, HAL_BUGCHECK_MCA_FATAL = 4.  This last value should be the expected one for the MCA driver, the other values being HAL internal error values. MCA log address MCA maximum log size SAL status of the last SAL interface. MCA INTERFACE FOR DRIVERS The Intel generic HalALs provides the following Intel Pentium  Pro and Itanium technology  MCA specific interface for drivers: HalSetSystemInformation with the HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to as HalMcaRegisterDriver.  This allows a driver  to register MCA driver callbacks with the HAL. Additionally the Itanium driver may use a HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to HalCmcRegisterDriver or HalCpeRegisterDriver for delivery of Corrected CPU errors (CMC) and Corrected Platform Errors (CPE). HalQuerySystemInformation with the HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set toas HalMcaLogInformation.  This allows thea driver to read the MCA bank log. Additionally the Itanium driver may use a HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS parameter set to HalCmcLogInformation or HalCpeLogInformation to read MCA logs from Corrected CPU errors (CMC) and/or Corrected Platform Errors (CPE). 243.1 HalSetSystemInformation to register MCA Driver NTSTATUS  HalSetSystemInformation( IN HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG  BufferSize, OUT PVOID  Buffer, HalSetSystemInformation can be used to register MCA driver with the HAL Parameters InformationClass : Specify HalMcaRegisterDriver to register MCA driver s callback routines with the HAL. There are two callback routines- ExceptionCallback and DpcCallback routine. The ExceptionCallback Routine is called duringwhen the Machine Check Exception handlera non-restartable error is processingfound by the Machine Check Exception handler and it is going to , before it bugchecks the system. The DpcCallback routine is called for when the MCA error is restartable. For Itanium systems, specify  HalCmcRegisterDriver to register a driver s Corrected CPU Error DpcCallback routine, and HalCpeRegisterDriver to register a driver s Corrected Platform Error DpcCallback. errors that generated the Machine Check Exception.

The only thing driver is allowed to do at that point is to log the information in NVRAM.  A driver explicitly may not utilize any kernel services or spinlock routines.  The handler is restricted to the same constraints as a driver operating at highest IRQL. DpcCallback is athe driver supplieddriver-supplied routine that getsis called for restartable errrors that caused Machine Check Exception. This routine will be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL. (Comment:  Restartable errors, by definition, do not cause MCE) DeviceContext is the Device specific context for this MCA Driver. Include ntddk.h Return Value HalSetSystemInformation returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the registration is successful. Comments HalSetSystemInformation must be called before any of the other interface routines can be used by a MCA drivera MCA driver can use any of the other interface routines. Only one MCA driver can be registered with the HAL at any time. The exception callback routine or the DPC callback routine parameters cannot be NULL.. 243.2 HalQuerySystemInformation to get MCA bank logs NTSTATUS  HalQuerySystemInformation( IN HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass, IN ULONG  BufferSize, OUT PVOID  Buffer, OUT PULONG  ReturnedLength HalQuerySystemInformation can be used to read MCA banks status registers Parameters InformationClass : Specify HalMcaLogInformation to read the current MCA error reporting banks log.

This directory contains source files for COMMAND.COM, including
internal commands.

A list of the internal commands, some characteristics, and hints
about where they're found appears in TDATA.ASM, labelled COMTAB.

COMSEG.ASM contains a brief description of each segment in
COMMAND.COM.

  TRANDATA contains data which doesn't usually change, so is
  included in the transient checksum area, while TRANSPACE is
  modifiable, and excluded from the transient checksum.  TRANSPACE
  variable should be treated as uninitialized data for every
  command cycle.

Here's a listing of the general contents of files,
concentrating on central functions and publics in each module.

                        SETVER Command overview
			MS-DOS 5.00
			05/13/90

SETVER is an external MS-DOS command which allows the user to
determine the MS-DOS version number will be reported by MS-DOS
to a specified user application. This will allow applications
which check for a specific version of MS-DOS to run under
MS-DOS 5.0.

A version table has been included as part of the MS-DOS system
files on the user's boot disk. SETVER will update the system
files so that next time and times thereafter, that MS-DOS is
booted, the updated version table will be in effect. NOTE: The
changes to the version table will not take effect until the
user reboots using the updated version of the table.


NOTE:
	Currently there is 512 bytes set aside for entries in the
	table but Ericst may want to up it in the near future so
	for right now I wouldn't mention the number of entries
	which the table will hold. Right now it will hold a minimum
	of 34 entries.

==========================================================================

USEAGE:
		List table:	SETVER [D:]
		Add entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext N.NN
		Delete entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext /DELETE
		Display help	SETVER /?

WHERE:
		D: is the drive containing MSDOS.SYS
		name.ext is the executable file name
		N.NN is the major and minor version numbers
		/DELETE is any combination of /D - /DELETE

==========================================================================

MESSAGES:

	If the table is being updated and there are no errors detected
	this message will be displayed.

	"Version table successfully updated"

	If the version table is only being displayed it will listed
	on the screen in the format:

	WIN200.BIN     3.30
	EXCEL.EXE      4.01
	MYPROG.EXE     3.20
	DELNODE.EXE    4.01
	

==========================================================================

EXAMPLE 1:

	SETVER a: excel.exe 4.01

	This example will add a new entry in the table for EXCEL.EXE
	to the version table on drive A: and will tell DOS to always
	report the MS-DOS version number 4.01 to this application.

EXAMPLE 2:

	SETVER	a: excel.exe /DELETE

	This example will delete the EXCEL.EXE entry from the version
	table on drive A:.

EXAMPLE 3:

	SETVER

	This example will list the contents of the version table
	on the current drive.

EXAMPLE 4:

	SETVER /?

	This example will cause the SETVER command to display
	help in using the command.

==========================================================================

RETURN CODES:
	0  Successful completion
	1  Invalid command switch
	2  Invalid file name specified
	3  Insuffient memory
	4  Invalid version number format
	5  Specified entry was not found in table
	6  MS-DOS system files not found
	7  Invalid drive specifier
	8  Too many command line parameters
	9  Missing parameters
	10 Error reading MS-DOS system files
	11 Version table is corrupt in system files
	12 Specifed MS-DOS system files do not support a version table
	13 Insuffient space in version table for new entry
	14 Error writing MS-DOS system files


==========================================================================

ERROR MESSAGES:

ERROR:  Invalid switch

	The user specified an invalid command line switch.

ERROR:  Invalid file name

	The user specified an invalid file name for a new
        version table entry. Possible causes are the specified
        file name did not follow standard MS-DOS file naming
	conventions or was a reserved MS-DOS file name

ERROR:  Insuffient memory

	There is insuffient memory for the program to run.

ERROR:  Invalid version number format must be 2.11 - 9.99

	An invalid version number was specified. Possible causes
	of this are that the specified version number was not in
	the proper format or it was less than 2.11 or greater than
	9.99.

ERROR:  Specified entry was not found in the version table

	The tried to delete an entry which was not in the existing
	version table.

ERROR:  File MSDOS.SYS not found on specified drive

	The user specified a drive which does not contain MS-DOS
	system files.

ERROR:  Invalid drive specifier

	The user specified a drive that does not exist.

ERROR:  Too many command line parameters

	The user specifed too many command line parameters such as
	by specifing both a version number and the /DELETE switch.

ERROR:  Missing parameter

	The user entered a file name but forgot to include either
	a version number or the /DELETE switch.

ERROR:  Reading MS-DOS system file

	There was an error trying to read the system files on the
	specified drive. Possible cause is that the specified drive
	does not contain system files.

ERROR:  Version table is corrupt

	An error was detected in the version table and it is not
	useable. The user should replace the system files on that
	disk and try again.

ERROR:	System files on the specifed drive do not support a version table

	The user specified a drive which contains MS-DOS system files
	which at not version 5.0 or above.

ERROR:  Insuffient space in version table for new entry

	The version table on the specified drive is full. The user can
	delete some entries from the table and try again.
	NOTE:	To be sure of room for the new entry the user should be
		sure that the entry that is deleted has a file name
		at least as long as the new entry.

ERROR:  Writing MS-DOS system file
	
	There was an error while trying to write the updated version
	version table. This would be caused by a bad disk.

	H2INC - .H to .INC file translation program

This program produces .INC files from .H files.  It handles hex and decimal
constant definitions (both word and long), structures, bitfields, and
comments.  It has some trouble with certain kinds of #define statements, but
it currently handles everything interesting in the various internal and public
Winthorn files.

		    COMMAND FORM

    h2inc [-t] [-c] [-g] [-s symfile] file.h [-o outfile]

Example:

    h2inc -s os2def.h -s os2win.h user.h


Translates file.h to an .inc file, sending output to outfile.inc if specified,
or to stdout.  symfile.h is a file to be scanned for typedefs that are used
by file.h.  One or more of "-s symfile.h" may be specified.

The '-c' option retains comments. Default action is to strip comments.
The '-g' option is described later on in this document.
The '-t' option retains the use of the Hungarian tag prepended to structure
element names.  This is not always desired.


		    COMPILER DIRECTIVES

The #undef directive is ignored.  #include is handled by mapping to
the masm include statement.  The quote or angle bracket delimiters are
removed, and any extension is replaced by ".inc":

    #include "file.h"		->  include file.inc
    #include <file.ext>		->  include file.inc

Directives such as #ifdef, #if, #else and #endif are replaced by their
MASM equivalents.

Simple empty #defines are handled by assigning the constant the value of 1:

    #define INCL_GPIINCLUDED	->  INCL_GPIINCLUED equ 1



		    CONSTANTS

h2inc understands hex, octal and decimal constants, both 16 and 32 bits.
Constants in parens or preceded by casts are generally handled pretty well.
Here are some examples illustrating how various constants are translated:

    #define LONG_CONSTANT	0x12345678L
    #define LONG_CONSTANT2	333L
    #define WORD_CONSTANT	0x234
    #define DEC_CONSTANT	(-1)
    #define LONG_DEC_CONSTANT	(-4L)

produces:

    LONG_CONSTANT		equ 012345678H
    LONG_CONSTANT2		equ 333
    WORD_CONSTANT		equ 0234H
    DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-1)
    LONG_DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-4)

	'>>', '<<' and '!' are translated to SHR, SHL and NOT respectively.
	'&' and '|' are translated to AND and OR.

	When a type cast is uncovered,  it is blanked out.  Type casts are
	defined as ([ ]XXX[ ][*][ ]) where XXX is a type KNOWN to h2inc.
	Known types are the built in int, short etc and any other type
	that h2inc has discovered so far, for example in a typedef.


		   STRUCTURES

Fields in a struct are expected only one per line. Field declarations like
"INT a, b" are not handled.

h2inc does a pretty good job of determining whether to use db, dw, or dd. It
knows about all types defined in that .H file, plus the primary C types:
char, int, unsigned, etc. It can also handle things of form "STRUCTURE *"
and "STRUCTURE FAR *", and produce dw or dd as appropriate.

Any primary data type h2inc does not know about is assumed to be a structure.
If a primary data type is defined in another .h file, the "-s symfile" option
will cause h2inc to scan that .h file for any type definitions.  Those
definitions will be used when translating the source file.

Structure types, arrays, and bitfields are handled too.  Below is
an example structure, with its h2inc'd output:

 The example above will get translated as follows:

    typedef FOO DWORD

    typedef struct _STRUCTURE {	  /* str */
	SHORT wOne;
	SHORT wTwo;
	RECT *prc;
	RECT rc;
	FOO  rgrc[10];
	CHAR rgch[20];
	BOOL fOneBit:1;
	BOOL fTwoBits:2;
	BOOL fThreeBits:3;
	SHORT (FAR *lpfn)();
    } STRUCTURE;


    STRUCTURE	struc
	str_wOne	dw  ?
	str_wTwo	dw  ?
	str_prc		dw  ?
	str_rc		(size RECT)/2 dup (?)
	str_rgrc	(size FOO)/2 * 10 dup (?)
	str_rgch	db  20 dup (?)
	str_fs		dw  ?
	str_lpfn	dd  ?
    STRUCTURE	ends
    str_fOneBit		equ	00001h
    str_fTwoBits	equ	00006h
    str_fThreeBits	equ	00038h

As can be seen, bitfields are handled in an interesting way.  The C field
name, prepended with the abbreviation tag, is actually the mask constant
to use, rather than the field offset.  The field offset is ALWAYS "fs"
prepended with the abbreviation tag.

Besides the standard winthorn types, h2inc also keeps track of other types
defined in the file so that it can determine whether to use db, dw, dd, or
dup.

			    IMPROVEMENTS


	o ASM statements and directives can be included in a '.h'
	  file by enclosing as follows
	  /* ASM
		asm statements and directives
	   */
	   These statements and/or directives are not processed, simply
	   copied.
	   There is a variation of ASM directive - ASMX. This works only
	   with '-g'. It is intended to be useful for defining segment
	   related stuff.
	o A structure can be translated to ASM named segment by
	  naming the segment in a standard C comment on the same line
	  as 'struct'. Selectively the fields of the struct (nee segment)
	  can be declared PUBLIC or initialised. The initialisation has
	  two flavours INIT and AINIT. AINIT is for initialising arrays
	  with distinct values. The following eg. illustrates. This is only
	  possible using '-g' option.

		struct foo {			/* SEGMENT FOOSEG */
			short	able;		/* Nothing special */
			short	baker;		/* PUBLIC */
			short	charlie;	/* INIT <MAXFOOBLE> */
			long	delta;		/* PUBLIC INIT <42> */
			char	eagle[16];	/* Vanilla */
			short	fox[MAXFOX];	/* PUBLIC INIT <0> */
			long	golf[MAXG];	/* AINIT <2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13> */
		};

		Would translate to:

		FOOSEG	segment
		able	DW	?
			PUBLIC	baker
		baker	DW	?
		charlie	DW	MAXFOOBLE
			PUBLIC	delta
		delta	DD	42
		eagle	DB	16 DUP(?)
			PUBLIC	fox
		fox	DW	MAXFOX DUP(0)
		golf	DD	2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
			.errnz	($ - golf) - MAXG*(SIZE DWORD)
		FOOSEG	ends

	  with '-c' options on.

	o INT size can be specified as either 16 bits or 32 bits by
	  a directive
		/* INT16 */	or	/* INT32 */
	  if neither is specified, a warning is issued whenever
	  'int' is used.

	o Nested structure declarations are now handled.

	o Bit fields upto 32 bits are supported.

	o Embedded structures i.e. structures within structures should
	  be declared with a typedef. eg.

	  typedef struct foo foo;
	  foo	foobar[MAXFOO];
		of course, the struct foo itself is declared elsewhere.

Module Name:

    suballoc.c

Abstract:

    This module contains code for managing a paritially commited address
    space.  It handles allocation of chunks of memory smaller than the 
    commit granularity.  It commits and decommits memory as needed using
    the supplied function for committing and decommitting memory.  The 
    structures used for tracking the address space are allocated outside
    of the specified addresss space.

Author:

    Dave Hastings (daveh) creation-date 21-Jan-1994
    
Notes:

    Since this package does not actually access memory in the address space
    it is managing, it will work as well with real linear addresses or 
    "Intel Addresses" such as would be encountered with the Insignia Emulator
    on risc.

Installable Virtual Device Driver (VDD) Support For NTVDM
==========================================================

Problem:
--------
There is a class of DOS applications which run on their
own custom hardware. Generally these applications will
have a pluggable card and a 16bit device driver for their
card. As these cards are beyond the scope of normal PC
architecture, NTVDM cannot virtualize them in a secure
manner. So all such applications are not supported under
NTVDM.

Solution:
---------

If an ISV is writing an NT native device driver for such a
card, it is technically quite simple to provide the support
such that the DOS application runs unmodified and in a secure
fashion. The vendor has to write a Virtual Device Driver (VDD)
which will virtualize the card for the DOS application by calling
the native device driver.

Following are the main work items to achieve the above solution:

    a. Loading the VDD
    b. Support for I/O mapped I/O
    c. Support for Memory mapped I/O
    d. Support for DMA operations
    e. Register manipulation services
    f. Memory accessing services
    g. Interrupt simulation services
    h. Miscelleneous services


a. Loading the VDD:

    The system administrator will add the command lines in the
    \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\CONTROL\"VirtualDeviceDrivers"
    section of the registry for all the VDDs to be loaded in the
    VDM process. The command line format is REG_MULT_SZ (i.e. ASCIIZZ).
    This key will laways be present and install program just need to
    add their VDD name.

    [VirtualDeviceDrivers]
      VDD = <full-path of the VDD1.DLL>\0<full-path of the VDD2>\0\0

    VDD ACTION :

    NTVDM will load all these VDDs from the registry at the VDM process
    initialization time and call their initialization routine. VDDs should
    make sure at this time that their respective NT device driver is
    present and make all the resource allocations. The VDD handle passed
    in this initialization routine will be the Id of the VDD when calling
    the VDD services as described below.


b. Support for I/O mapped I/O:

   Following services will be provided for VDDs to deal with  IO
   ports:

   BOOL VDDInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE, IO_PORT_HANDLERS);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE);

   The HANDLE is the one passed to the VDD in its DLLInit routine.
   Only one IO hook may be installed for a given port, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On DeInstalling, the default IO hook will be
   placed, which means no one is hooked on those IO ports. IO_PORT_HANDLERS
   should atleast provide a byte read and a byte write handler. In addition,
   word and string handlers can also be provided. In the absense of word
   or string handlers, these will be emulated using byte handlers.
   A port has to be hooked for both read and write. VDDs should not hook
   DMA ports as these are virtualized by NTVDM and services are provided
   for VDDs to access DMA.

   VDD Action:  On an IO access (or on a series of IO accesses) the VDD
                can check if it needs to start the DMA. If so it can call
                the DMA services given in the following section. If it
                does'nt require the DMA or if the DMA has transfered the
                buffer, then the VDD can call its NT device driver to
                complete the desired request. (Its also possible that the
                VDD first requests the device driver and than using DMA
                services copies the contents to the VDM buffer).


c. Support for Memory mapped I/O:

   Following services will be  provided for VDDs to deal with their
   memory mapped addresses:

   BOOL VDDInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE, MEMORY_HANDLER);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE);

   The addr_range should be a valid range i.e. above RMSIZE and below system
   rom. Only one Memory hook may be installed for a given range, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On deinstalling the range, VDD will no longer get page
   fault on those ranges.     Memory_handler will
   tell on which address the fault occured and whether it was a
   read or write fault. On its return from the memory handler it will be
   assumed that the fault was handled.


   A port-range will actually result in a whole page to be reserved. That
   means the page will not remain available to EMM for EMM page frames and
   UMBs.

   VDD Action: It can map the normal memory and let the app write to it.
	       Later they can use the WIN32 API's or its device driver
	       as per the case to deal the whole memory range.

d. Support for DMA operations

   Following DMA service will be provided for the VDD:

   DWORD VDDRequestDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, BUFFER, TRANSFER_BYTES);
   BOOL VDDQueryDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);
   BOOL VDDSetDma (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, INDEX, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);

   NTVDM will control all the DMA ports and will maintain all the
   information on per channel basis. There are two flavors in which
   a VDD can carry-out the DMA operations. It can call VDDRequestDMA
   and this service will interpret the DMA registers and do the
   DMA transfer. It should be clear at this point that this will
   involve two buffer copyings. For example, the VDD will ask the device
   driver to trasnfer some data in a buffer (allocated by VDD) then it will
   call this service to transfer this buffer to the address DOS application
   has asked for (through DMA programming).

   On the other hand, a VDD can collect all the DMA registers using
   VDDQueryDMA and figure out where the DOS application	has asked the
   DMA to take place, in what mode and how much to transfer. Then it can
   call the NT device driver with same address as asked by DOS app. In this
   case there will be only one copying. VDD should use VDDSetDMA after
   such an operation to update the DMA state.

e. Register manipulation services:

   See the reference section for details. There is a get and a set service
   for each V86 registers.


f: Memory Accessing services:

   Following services are provided for Manipulating VDM's memory.

   PVOID GetVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FreeVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FlushVDMPointer(ULONG Addr,
			ULONG Size, PVOID Buffer, BOOL ProtectedMode);

g: Interrupt simulation services

   Following services is provided for simulating an interrupt to the VDM.

   VOID VDDSimulateInterrupt (BYTE ms, BYTE line, WORD count);


h. Miscellaneous Services

   Following services will be provided for memory allocation/deallocation.

   VDDAllocMem (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);
   VDDFreeMem  (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);

   VDD will use VDDAllocMem when it gets a page fault on a page which
   it has hooked using VDDInstallMemoryHook. Later it can free this memory
   using VDDFreeMem. We are asking VDDs to use WIN32 API for all their needs
   and here also a VDD could have used VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree. The
   problem is that on a non-x86 machine this would'nt have worked because
   on such a plateform the VDM memory is under the emulator's control and it
   has to be told of such memory changes.

   Following service will be provided for VDM termination.

   VDDTerminateVDM (VOID);

   VDD will use this service to terminate the VDM. For instance if a VDD
   fails to allocate memory on a memory mapped IO, it may want to terminate
   the VDM as its state is inconsistenet.

   VDDs should always use these services to achieve plateform independence.

 *
 *	4. Installing a hook on a memory range will result in the
 *         consumption of memory based upon page boundaries. The Starting
 *         address is rounded down, and the count is rounded up to the
 *         next page boundary. The VDD's memory hook handler will be
 *         invoked for all addreses within the page(s) hooked. The page(s)
 *         will be set aside as mapped reserved sections, and will no
 *         longer be available for use by NTVDM or other VDDs. The VDD is
 *         permitted to manipulate the memory (commit, free, etc) as needed.
 *
 *	5. After calling the MemoryHandler, NTVDM will return to the

An Explanation of VDMDBG.DLL

                            BobDay - 10 Jun 93

Section 2.0 - The Simulated Environment
Section 3.0 - The 32-bit Environment
Section 4.0 - Communication Protocol via Exception
Section 5.0 - The VDM Debugging APIs

1.0 Overview

    This document describes the mechanism used to support debugging DOS and
    WIN16 applications under Windows NT.  The mechanism involves 2 parts
    in the simulated environment, one for v86 mode (or simulated real mode)
    and one for protected mode.  It also involves 3 parts in the 32-bit NT
    environment, one for fielding information from the simulated enviroment
    and sending it to the debugger, one for code in the debugger, and one
    for code in a DLL used by the debugger.

        16-bit simulated environment     32-bit environment

                NTIO.SYS                  DBG.LIB (in NTVDM.EXE)
                KRNL286.EXE               NTSD (WinDbg or equivalent)
                                          VDMDBG.DLL


2.0 Simulated enviroment

    Once the simulated environment is up and running, if one of the normal
    debugging type events occurs it gets simulated to happen exactly the
    way it would on a normal PC.  This means that if an INT 3 occurs, it
    pushes the flags, CS, IP, looks up the address in the IVT and then
    jumps to it.  Same goes for INT 1's and INT D's (GP Faults).  If the
    processor is in protected mode, these interrupts are normally trapped
    by the DOS extender (most of the time DOSX.EXE) and then reflected
    down into the real mode interrupts (except for GP Faults).

    In order to debug in the simulated enviroment, it is necessary to
    catch and process these events.  The simplest way to do this is to
    install our own routines to watch these interrupts and that is
    what NTIO.SYS and KRNL286.EXE do.  They are nothing but small
    stubs which insert themselves into the interrupt chains (NTIO.SYS
    inserts itself into the real mode interrupt chain, and KRNL286.EXE
    inserts itself into the protected mode interrupt chain).  It is important
    to install oneself as early as possible so that other programs (such
    as DEBUG.COM) can install themselves ahead of these small stubs.
    In this way the events are only detected when they are not handled by some
    program in the simulated environment.

    Also, segment loading and unloading notifications are routed to
    these small stubs so that the debugger can be notified when selectors
    are associated with programs and their symbols.

    The small stubs will perform a BOP (a method of transitioning from
    the simulated environment back to the real 32-bit NT environment and
    notifying it that a debug event has occurred). After the BOP, they will
    either perform an IRET instruction to return control back to the simulated
    program generating the interrupt, or pass the interrupt down to the
    previous interrupt handler (continue down the chain).  The decision
    whether to return from or pass the interrupt will be made on the basis
    of the ContinueDebugEvent continue status parameter.  DBG_CONTINUE will
    IRET, DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLE will pass it back down the chain.

3.0 32-bit environment

    Once the 32-bit environment has been notified that a debug event has
    occurred, it begins executing code in NTVDM (DBG.C) which parcels up the
    register context (based on the type of event which occurred) and
    communicates all the information to the debugger.

    Since the debugger is in another process's context, communication
    is done through exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception with the
    status STATUS_VDM_EVENT.  Exception information will be passed via the
    "lpArguments" parameter to the API RaiseException().

    The lpArguments parameter will cause an array of 4 DWORD values to
    be passed to the debugger. The values of the meanings of the array
    will be discussed in section 4.0

    The debugger should receive this exception and return from the call
    WaitForDebugEvent (debuggers should always have some thread waiting
    for debug events).  By examining the events dwDebugEventCode member,
    the debugger can determine the type of the debug event.  If this type
    is EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT, then the

          u.Exception.ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode

    member of the debug event structure will contain the exception type.
    If this value is STATUS_VDM_EVENT then the exception is coming from the
    16-bit environment.

    When an exception of this type is detected, a debugger should load (if
    it hasn't done so already) the VDMDBG.DLL and determine the addresses
    of the key functions needed.  The key functions are:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread
        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext


    The prototypes and structures used by this DLL are prototyped in the header
    file VDMDBG.H.  Section 5.0 explains each of these functions.

    Debuggers should not use these APIs to deal with the 16-bit environment:

        GetThreadSelectoryEntry
        GetThreadContext
        SetThreadContext

    The APIs ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory are still useful except
    that the debugger must convert the 16-bit addresses into 32-bit addresses
    (using VDMGetPointer).

    Each and every exception with the exception code of STATUS_VDM_EVENT
    should be passed to the function VDMProcessException.  This function
    filters out the extraneous communication between the 16-bit environment
    and the VDMDBG.DLL.  Most of this extraneous communication a debugger
    can ignore (deals with segment & module loading & unloading, this
    information will be provided via another interface).  If the event is
    part of this communication process, VDMProcessException will return
    FALSE, if not, it will return TRUE.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns FALSE, the debugger can
    immediately call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of
    DBG_CONTINUE and return to waiting for additional debug events.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns TRUE, then the lpArguments
    parameter of the exception should be processed to determine the type of
    event (INT 1, INT 3, INT D, etc.).  The debugger can then act accordingly.
    When it has completed operating with the thread, the debugger should
    call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of DBG_CONTINUE
    or DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED.

    For the processing of each of the debug events, the debugger should use
    the API VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry, VDMGetThreadContext, and
    VDMSetThreadContext instead of the likewise named functions listed above
    that are exported from KERNEL32.DLL.  These functions operate on an x86
    CONTEXT structure, even when running on a non-x86 machine.  The debugger
    should likewise present an x86 debugging view (x86 register dump, x86
    dis-assembly, breakpoints are INT 3's, etc.)

4.0 Communication Protocol via. Exceptions

    The method of communicating between the application and debugger
    will be exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception and debugger should
    receive it.  NTVDM can detect whether or not it is being debugged, and
    will conditionally raise the exception.

    If a debugger attaches itself to an existing NTVDM process, the
    32-bit environment detects this and comminicates an acknowledgement
    of this attachment.  This allows debuggers to perform initialization
    dealing with the 16-bit environment before beginning any new 16-bit tasks.

    For the simulated 16-bit environment, the exception code will always be
    STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    On NT, each exception can only contain up to 4 DWORD values.  Here is
    how they are used for this communication.  The first 2 DWORDs contain
    4 WORD fields.  The last two DWORDs are just DWORDs.

      +---------+
      | W1 | W2 | = DW1
      +---------+
      | W3 | W4 | = DW2
      +---------+
      |   DW3   |
      +---------+
      |   DW4   |
      +---------+

    The header file VDMDBG.H contains macros for isolating the individual
    parts of the exception information.

    The W1 field is a WORD which specifies which type of event has occurred.
    This can be one of the following:

        W1 ==  0 - Segment Load Notification (DBG_SEGLOAD)
        W1 ==  1 - Segment Move Notification (DBG_SEGMOVE)
        W1 ==  2 - Segment Free Notification (DBG_SEGFREE)
        W1 ==  3 - Module Load Notification  (DBG_MODLOAD)
        W1 ==  4 - Module Free Notification  (DBG_MODFREE)
        W1 ==  5 - Int 01h break             (DBG_SINGLESTEP)
        W1 ==  6 - Int 03h break             (DBG_BREAKPOINT)
        W1 ==  7 - Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)  (DBG_GPFAULT)
        W1 ==  8 - Divide Overflow           (DBG_DIVOVERFLOW)
        W1 ==  9 - Invalid Opcode Fault      (DBG_INSTRFAULT)
        W1 == 10 - Task starting             (DBG_TASKSTART)
        W1 == 11 - Task stop                 (DBG_TASKSTOP)
        W1 == 12 - DLL starting              (DBG_DLLSTART)
        W1 == 13 - DLL stop                  (DBG_DLLSTOP)

    They are described below.

    The debugger will probably need to be smart enough to know how to manage
    both protected mode selectors and segment numbers from simulated real mode.

    Segment/selector to symbol lookup should be mode sensitive and only use
    segments from the appropriate mode.

4.1 Segment Load Notification

    Under Win16, this event is used to indicate that a selector has just
    been created and that it maps to a module's segment.

    When a .EXE or .DLL is loaded, many of these events will be received.
    No module load notification event will occur (this is the way it is
    done under Windows 3.1 too).

    Under DOS, no segment load notifications will occur.

        W1  = DBG_SEGLOAD (0)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector assigned to new segment
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Segment within module
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Code/data information from segment definition
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.2 Segment Move Notification

    A segment has changed from one selector number to another.  If the
    new selector number is 0, this should be considered the same as
    discarding (freeing) the segment.

    This event only happens under Win16.  As such, these selectors should be
    tagged as protected mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_SEGMOVE (1)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Old selector number
        Selector2 - New selector number (0 to discard segment)
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.3 Segment Free Notification

    When a segment is being released, this event will be received.

    This event only happens under Win16.

        W1  = DBG_SEGFREE (2)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector number
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.4 Module Load Notification

    This event is used to indicate that a module is going to take up a
    range of memory.

    This event is used only under DOS.  As such, these segment numbers
    should be tagged as simulated real mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_MODLOAD (3)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Starting segment
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Length of module (in bytes)

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.5 Module Free Notification

    Module freeing notifications happen under both DOS and Win16.  For
    to determine which selectors to free for a Win16 application, all of the
    selectors must be scanned to determine if it was associated with this
    module.  Again, this is the way it is done under Windows 3.1.

        W1  = DBG_MODFREE (4)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.6 Int 01h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoint, trace bit setting mechanisms.

        W1  = DBG_SINGLE_STEP (5)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.7 Int 03h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_BREAKPOINT (6)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.8 Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_GPFAULT (7)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    It is also important to note that all GP Faults will not be sent via
    this interface.  The Win16 subsystem intercepts some of the GP faults
    in its parameter validation code.  Faults in the parameter validation
    code indicated that an invalid parameter is being passed to one of the
    16-bit APIs.  There is currently no way to intercept these faults, the
    APIs will just return errors in the same mechanism as under Windows 3.1.

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.9 Divide Overflow break (Int 0)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_DIVOVERFLOW (8)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.A Invalid Opcode Fault (Int 6)

        W1  = DBG_INSTRFAULT (9)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.B Task starting

    After all of the image has been loaded for the application, but
    before executing the first instruction, this event will occur.

        W1  = DBG_TASKSTART (0Ah)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.C Task stopping

    After all of the image has been unloaded for the application
    this event will occur.  None of the segments for the application
    will be valid.  This is provided for the debugger to clean up any
    internal data it keeps on a per task basis.

        W1  = DBG_TASKSTOP (0Bh)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.D Dll starting

    After the image of the DLL has been loaded, but before the
    Dll's initialization code is executed, this event will occur.

        W1  = DBG_DLLSTART (0Ch)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.E Dll stopping

    After all of the image of the DLL has been unloaded for the Dll
    this event will occur.  None of the segments for the Dll will be
    valid.  This is provided for the debugger to clean up any internal
    data it keeps on a per Dll basis.

        W1  = DBG_DLLSTOP (0Ch)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.F Attach Acknowlegement

    Once the 16-bit environment has detected that a debugger is present
    it sends this event to allow the debugger to perform any initialization
    processing specific to the 16-bit environment.

        W1  = DBG_ATTACH (0Dh)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

5.0 The VDM debugging APIs

    These APIs are described below:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMEnumProcessWOW
        VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The following APIs require WOWDEB.EXE to be loaded and running in the
    Win16 subsystem.  WOWDEB.EXE is started automatically if the debugger
    is present at process creation time (CreateProcess with debug options
    set). If the debugger is attached to the Win16 subsystem process after
    the process has already been created (with the DebugActiveProcess API),
    then the debugger should spawn WOWDEB.EXE before starting the Win16 task
    to be debugged.

        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext

    This following APIs are obsolete.  They return failure conditions.

        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread

5.1 VDMProcessException

    BOOL VDMProcessException(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent
    );

    The VDMProcessExecption function performs the pre-processing needed to
    prepare the debug event for handling by the debugger.

    This function filters all VDM debugee/debugger communication for
    information which is only used by the VDM debugging DLL (VDMDBG.DLL).
    This function is only valid in the context of processing for debug
    events that are of type STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    The return value is TRUE if the debug event should be processed by the
    debugger.

    The return value is FALSE if the debug event should be ignored.  This
    This indicates that no processing should occur for this debug event.
    The event should be continued using ContinueDebugEvent with a continue
    status of DBG_CONTINUE.

5.2 VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry

    BOOL VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector
        LPLDT_ENTRY     lpSelectorEntry
    );

    This function is used to return a descriptor table entry for the
    specified VDM thread corresponding to the specified selector.  This
    function is simimlar to the API GetThreadSelectorEntry except that
    it works on the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment, and it works on all
    systems, not just x86 systems.

    This API returns a simulated descriptor entry on non-x86 systems.
    Simulated descriptor entrys may (on some systems) have the base value
    adjusted to account for the fact that the simulated address space may
    not begin at linear (32-bit) address 0.

    It is also important to note that 16-bit applications may modify
    the contents of the LDT entries.  For example, the Win16 subsystem
    may change the selector's base value to coalesce discontinous memory
    segments.  Also, please see the description in VDMGetPointer.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.  The selector
                    value may be a global selector (GDT) or a local selector
                    (LDT).

    lpSelectorEntry If the specifed selector is contained within the
                    thread's descriptor tables, its descriptor table entry
                    is copied into the data structure pointed to by this
                    parameter.  This data can be used to compute the linear
                    base address that segment relative addresses refer to.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by lpSelectorEntry receives a copy of the
    specified descriptor table entry.

    Refer to the WinHelp entry for the structure of an LDT_ENTRY.

5.3 VDMGetPointer

    ULONG VDMGetPointer(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        DWORD           dwOffset,
        BOOL            fProtMode
    );

    This function is used to convert a 16-bit address into a flat 32-bit
    address.

    It is also very important to note that under the WIN16 environment,
    pointers derived from protected mode selectors may change.  WIN16 does
    this by changing selector's base value to coalesce memory during
    compaction.  For this reason, it is necessary that any addresses
    evaluated in the 16-bit environment should be reevaluated each time
    an access into 16-bit memory is needed.  An example would be
    placing and removing 16-bit breakpoint instructions.  If the debugger
    is told to place a breakpoint at a given address of SEL:OFFSET, then
    when the breakpoint is needs to be removed, the debugger must reevaluate
    the SEL:OFFSET address since it might have moved in terms of the linear
    32-bit address.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to determine the pointer for.

    dwOffset        Supplies the offset value to determine the pointer for.

    fProtMode       Indicates whether the 16-bit address specified is a
                    real mode (v86 mode) address or a protected mode address.
                    Protected mode addresses are translated through the
                    descriptor tables.

    The return value is a 32-bit linear address pointing to the memory
    in the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment that represents the 16-bit address
    specified.  The return value is NULL, if the address specified is invalid.
    On some systems, NULL may be returned for the address 0:0.

    To determine the address of the simulated 16-bit memory, VDMGetPointer
    may be called with the address 0:0 and an fProtMode of FALSE.

5.4 VDMGetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMGetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The context of a specified simulated DOS or WIN16 thread can be
    retrieved using VDMGetThreadContext.  The context returned will
    always be that of an x86 system.

    This API returns a simulated context for x86 and non-x86 systems.
    Under some systems, values within the context are meaningless.  For
    example, the CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS portions on RISC systems have
    no effect.

    Release 1 of Windows NT has a 286 emulator on RISC systems.  For this
    reason, only the 16-bit registers can be supported on RISC systems.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    If the specified thread is a simulated DOS or WIN16
                    thread, its context is copied into the data structure
                    pointed to by this parameter.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by <lpVDMContext> receives a copy of the
    simulated context.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.5 VDMSetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMSetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The VDMSetThreadContext function sets the simulated context in the
    specified DOS or WIN16 thread.  The function allows selective context
    to be set based on the value of the ContextFlags member of the context
    structure.  This API operates only when debugging a simulated DOS or
    WIN16 thread.  The caller must have a thread handle which was created
    with THREAD_SET_CONTEXT access.

    The context set will always be that of an x86 system.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    Supplies the address of a context structure that
                    contains the context that is to be set in the specified
                    thread.  The value of the ContextFlags member of this
                    structure specifies which portions of a thread's context
                    are to be set.  Some values in the context structure are
                    not settable and are silently set to the correct values.
                    This include CPU status register bits that specify
                    processor mode, debug register global enabling bits, and
                    other state that must be completely controlled by the
                    system.

    The return value is TRUE if the context was set; otherwise it is FALSE if
    an error occurred.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.6 VDMGetSelectorModule

    BOOL VDMGetSelectorModule(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        PUINT           lpSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        UINT            nSize,
        LPSTR           lpModulePath,
        UINT            nPathSize
    );

    The VDMGetSelectorModule function is intended to provide an interface
    such that debuggers can determine which module belongs to a code or
    data address.  Given the selector for that address, the function will
    return the module name, and the segment number (0 based) of the segment
    that corresponds to that selector.  If the selector is not a selector
    which directly corresponds to a module, the function will return FALSE.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.

    lpSegmentNumber Returns the segment number within the module.

    lpModuleName    Buffer to receive the module name.

    nModuleSize     Size of the buffer.

    lpModulePath    Buffer to receive the module path name.

    nPathSize       Size of the buffer.

    The return value is TRUE if the selector is mapped directly to a module.
    This means it must be either a code or data segment.  Selectors allocated
    using the global memory management functions are not mapped directly to
    a module.  The return value is FALSE if the function is not successful.

    The function returns the segment number in the address specified by
    the lpSegmentNumber parameter, and the module name in the address
    specified by the lpModuleName parameter.

    It is up to the debugger to determine from the module and segment number
    information the correct symbol, if a symbol lookup is needed.

5.7 VDMGetModuleSelector

    BOOL VDMGetModuleSelector(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        UINT            uSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        LPWORD          lpSelector
    );

    The VDMGetModuleSelector function is the reverse operation of the
    VDMGetSelectorModule function.  A module name and segment number
    are converted into a selector number.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    uSegmentNumber  Supplies the segment number to look up.

    lpModuleName    Specifies the module name of the segment.

    lpSelector      Returns the selector value.

    The return value is TRUE if the module and segment are found.  Also,
    the lpSelector value is filled-in with the selector of that segment.
    Otherwise, the return value is FALSE.

    It is up to the debugger to convert symbol names and expressions into
    modules, segment numbers and offsets.  Usings the modules and segment
    numbers, a selector value can be determined.  In combination with the
    offset, the selector can be used to index into the simulated Win16
    environment for reading, writing, etc.

5.8 VDMEnumProcessWOW

    INT VDMEnumProcessWOW(
        PROCESSENUMPROC fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumProcessWOW function enumerates all of the processes in
    the system which are Win16 subsystem processes.  In NT's first release,
    there is only one Win16 subsystem.  For later releases, there may be
    more than one process to support address space seperation for Win16
    tasks.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 subsystem processes, or the
    number enumerated before enumeration was terminated.

        DWORD           dwAttributes,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 subsystem process
    in the system.

    dwProcessId     Provides the process id of a Win16 subsystem.

    dwAttributes    Provides flags indicating information about the process.

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumProcessWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.

    The dwAttributes field should be compared with the bit mask WOW_SYSTEM
    to determine if the process is the main Win16 subsystem process.  The
    main Win16 subsystem process will be the process that the next Win16
    task that specifies no address space seperation requirements.

    Win16 subsystem processes which are created due to address space
    seperation will not have the WOW_SYSTEM bit enabled.

5.9 VDMEnumTaskWOW

    INT
    VDMEnumTaskWOW(
        DWORD           dwProcessId,
        TASKENUMPROC    fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumTaskWOW function enumerates all of the Win16 tasks currently
    running in the Win16 subsystem process id specified.

    dwProcessId     Supplies the process id of the Win16 subsystem.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 tasks or the number of
    tasks enumerated before terminating.

    BOOL TaskEnumProc(
        DWORD           dwThreadId,
        WORD            hMod16,
        WORD            hTask16,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 task.

    dwThreadId      Provides the thread id of the Win16 task

    hMod16          Provides the Win16 module handle for the task

    hTask16         Provides the Win16 task handle for the task

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6E:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\TECH2.DOT s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.09 Microsoft Word 6.0s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.13 NOTE: This is BETA software, no shipping version will be version 2.13. Once this passes by all the interested parties, and the bugs are worked out, I will release the version. It will most likely be called version 2.50 since it changes the subclassing technique used.  I will be filling in the details of the new functions and features, for now I am VERY interested in knowing if this version breaks any existing applications. Please try the new version with your current products to see if anything has been upset by the new release of ctl3d. New Functions Ctl3dSubclassCtlEx(HWND hwnd, int ct) Subclasses the specified window using the window type given in ct. These can be: CTL3D_BUTTON_CTL Button  CTL3D_LISTBOX_CTL Listbox CTL3D_EDIT_CTL Edit Control CTL3D_COMBO_CTL  Combo Box CTL3D_STATIC_CTL Static Control This function is meant to be use to subclass superclassed ( or cloned ) classes. If you superclass the edit control to make your own edit control ( MyEDIT ) you can use this function to do the subclass. This API does not perform checking on style bits and such to see if the control would normally be subclassed by ctl3d. This means it is very easy to get into trouble using this function.  Ctl3dUnsubclassCtl(HWND hwnd) This funciton will remove ctl3d s subclass from the specified window. Ctl3d s subclass can only be removed if there are no other subclasses on the window after ctl3d s subclass. In other words, if the window has been subclassed by anyone after ctl3d has subclassed the window, the subclass will not be removed. Ctl3d will disable itself in this case. Ctl3dIsAutoSubclass(void) Want to know if this application has already been autosubclassed ? This function will return TRUE if it is. Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass(void) Want to turn off automatic subclassing, may only while you create this particular dialog ? This funciton is what you want. It will turn off autosubclassing. However if another part of the application has also turned on automatic subclassing, then Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass may not remove the automatic subclassing. This funciton is meant to be used by DLLs who need to use automatic subclassing.  New Messages Win32: CTL3D_CTLCOLORMSGBOX CTL3D_CTLCOLOREDIT CTL3D_CTLCOLORLISTBOX CTL3D_CTLCOLORBTN CTL3D_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR  CTL3D_CTLCOLORSTATIC CTL3D_CTLCOLORDLG Win16: CTL3D_CTLCOLOR (WM_USER+CTLMSGOFFSET) Ctl3d will send these messages to a dialog s window procedure when it has not recieved a response to the regular WM_CTL* messages from the dialogs dialog procedure. This allows MFC applications to handle the color messages that are being eaten between ctl3d and MFC. New Features Automatic Subclassing Ctl3d now automaticly subclasses any control ( that it would normally subclass ) as it is created on a dialog which has been subclassed by ctl3d. This means that controls created by CreateWindow on a dialog will be subclassed without having to call Ctl3dSubclassCtl.  Automatic Subclassing from a DLL Ctl3dAutoSubclass can be used from a DLL. If the client application has called Ctl3dAutoSubclass already, ctl3d keeps count of how many times it is called for the whole app.  Only the last Ctl3dUnregister , or the new Ctl3dUnAutoSubclass will cause the automatic subclassing to be turned off. Thread safe. Ctl3d is now safe to use if you have multiple user interface theads that own controls or dialogs.  Bugs Fixed Hanguel Windows: bug fixed in drawing text. Ctl3d shouldn t paint 3d borders around a icon anymore. Ctl3d shouldn t generate those nasty first chance exceptions in Win32 anymore. However there is still a fix to come. In Windows NT 3.1, ctl3d CANNOT send WM_CTL* color messages to the dialogs dialog proc because the pointer may not be valid. Ctl3d will send it s own CTL3D_CTL* messages in this case. This should be fixed in Daytona, stay tuned. Ctl3d should always paint the bottom of a combo box after it s list box has been dropped and removed. It sometime lost this 3d effect before.  Ctl3d should not send MFC ( or any application that used GetNextDlgItem and radio buttons ) into an infinite loop anymore. Ctl3d No longer paints the area around a radio button in the wrong color in WIN32.  filename TECH2.DOT 03/24/94 Normal Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Default Paragraph Font Footer Header Footnote Reference Footnote Text Normal Indent indent bullet single-sp bullet abstract bridge byline history art status revision history button-dir abstract title syntax biography title abstract bullet bulleted list 1 disclaimer description number figure in abstract comment numbered list 1 bulleted list 2 numbered list 2 figure in list table title table head no-head list add'l para example code list bulleted list 3 normal precode precode list keywords alpha list 2 quote quoted person note bulleted list note add'l para figure caption table in list example in list boxed heading boxed text button-open button-run code list 2 term1 def1 addl para term2 term3 table rule list para 2 list para 3 kyle,\\MONGOLIA\WRITER\KYLEMAR\CTL3DNEW\NEW3D.DOC Kyle,\\mongolia\writer\KYLEMAR\CTL3DNEW\NEW3D.DOC @Printer LPT1: winspool Printer Letter  N N N Printer Letter  N N N Times New Roman Symbol Arial CG Times Univers Courier New &E:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\TECH2.DOT"What s New in Ctl3d - Version 2.09

The document breifly describes DdeStrs.exe.

DdeStrs is intended to exercise and stress Dde/Ddeml.

Some areas exercised in the test are ...

    o  Async/fAckRequest advise loops
    o  Async executes
    o  CF_TEXT, CF_DIB, CF_BITMAP, CF_METAFILEPICT, CF_PALETTE,
       and CF_ENHMETAFILE (w32 only) formats.
    o  DdeConnectList/DdeDisconnectList
    o  AppOwned handles [when -a option used]
    o  Variable client/server connects (number of instances running
       of ddestrs.exe)
    o  Cross process/In process and multithread communication.
    o  System Timers


The command line options are ...

DdeStrs [-#%,-e#,-t#,-d,-a,-s,-c,-f#,-nNAME,-i#,-p,-?]

    where -#% allow the user to specify the intensity of
	the run (# = [1...100]) and can be read as stress
	percentage.  1 being low stress 100 being high stress.

    where -e# allows override of the delay set by the stress
	level.	-e0 is usefull if the stress test is the only one
	running and it is desirable for the test to cover ground
	(number of windows, classes, and messages that are
	exercised).  # is in milliseconds.

    where -t# specifies the number of minutes for the test to run.  At
	the end of # minutes the test will shutdown.  Default is 4320 min
	(About a weekend).  Test can also be exited manually at any
	point.

    where -d selects debug mode.  This mode of operation displays
	additional test information and outputs failures to
	the debug terminal.  This mode is intended for debugging
	DdeStrs failures and not for use in public stress runs.

    where -a specifies to use AppOwned handle for data communications.

    where -s specifies that this instance is to run as server only
	[default is -s -c].

    where -c specifies that this instance is to run as client only.
	[default is -s -c].

    where -f# allow specific formats to be used.  Default is all
	formats.  If any specific formats are specified then only
	to formats will be used in the communication.

	[Ex - ddestrs -f1 -f2] will only use formats 1 and 2.

	Formats    1  CF_TEXT
		   2  CF_DIB
		   3  CF_BITMAP
		   4  CF_ENHMETAFILE  (w32 only)
		   5  CF_METAFILEPICT
		   6  CF_PALETTE

    where -nNAME specifies the computer name to connect to.  This
	is used for netdde and only needs to be specified on client
	applications.  NAME=servername, Example '-njohnsp1' for
	computer \\johnsp1.  Use Ddeshare.exe (w31 resources kit or
	Nt sdk) to setup the dde share enabling netdde to work.  DdeStrs
	Service Name=DdeStrs, Topic=Test, and permissions must be
	change or greater (ddestrs.exe uses executes).

    where -i# specifies the number of threads to execute.  # can
	be in the range [1..5].  This option is only available
	for Win Nt.

    where -p specifies pause before data update.  With this specified the user can
	manually start executes and advise updates.  With this connections are established, but
	no data is passed until manually started. DdeStrs adds a 'pause' button to allow stress
	to be started and stopped.  Default is NO -p.

    where -? brings up a brief help list of DdeStrs Options.

Test Usage ...

    Ddestrs will communicate with multiple copies of itself.  Each
    new instance of ddestrs started will cause other instances to
    connect to all running copies available for conversation.  This
    allows the stress level to be tailored both by the -#% and
    by the number of copies of the test running.

Header File Organization
        ------------------------

This document describes the rules for public Windows 3.1 header files.  These
rules are designed to promote consistency, clarity, Win32 compatibility, ANSI
compatibility, motherhood, and apple pie a la mode.

In the past, windows.h has been fairly randomly organized: it wasn't very
easy to look in the file and figure out how constants, types, and functions
are related.  However, the new windows.h is much more rationally organized,
and it's now far easier to understand and modify.  In interests of
consistency, readability, and maintainability, it's important that all of our
public header files are consistently organized.

    *  Include a copyright banner at the top of the file.  Something like:

/*****************************************************************************\
*                                                                             *
* header.h -    Brief description of purpose of header file                   *
*                                                                             *
*               Version 3.10                                                  *                   *
*                                                                             *
*               Copyright (c) 1992, Microsoft Corp.  All rights reserved.     *
*                                                                             *
\*****************************************************************************/

       If this header file has been released before, the copyright date
       should be something like: 1985-1992.

    *  Arrange your header in functional groups, like windows.h.  Try to
       keep related types, structures, constants and functions as close
       together as possible in the header.  Separate functional groups
       within the header with a banner comment, as in windows.h.

    *  Within a functional group, general typedefs and constants should come
       first, followed by logically organized function prototypes.

    *  Constants or types used by only one or two functions should be
       declared near the function.

    *  Make sure that everything defined in the header file is included by
       default: don't require people to #define things to get certain
       definitions.

    *  If you do want to break up your header file, use the #define NOXXX
       convention used by windows.h.  Try not to have too many groups
       controled by NOXXX #defines, because they get confusing and hard to
       deal with.  Compiler speed and memory capacity is not the problem it
       once was, especially with precompiled headers.

    *  Constants designed to be ANDed or ORed should be defined in hex.
       The number of digits should reflect the data size: 2 for bytes,
       4 for words, and 8 for longs.  Long hex constants should have
       an appended L, e.g., 0x12345678L.

    *  Ordinal constants values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) should be declared
       in decimal.

    *  Provide a comment on all #else's and #endif's that suggests its
       corresponding #ifdef: e.g.

            #ifdef FOO
            ...
            #else   /* FOO */

            #endif  /* !FOO */

    *  Precede the header file with #pragma pack(1), and terminate with
       #pragma pack().  This ensures that the structures declared in the
       header will be packed properly, regardless of what compiler packing
       options the user is using for his own code.  Because the Windows RC
       compiler chokes on #pragma statements in .rc files, it's a good idea
       to include this (and any other #pragmas) in an #ifndef RC_INVOKED.

            #ifndef RC_INVOKED
            #pragma pack(1)         /* Assume byte packing throughout */
            #endif  /* RC_INVOKED */

       and:

            #ifndef RC_INVOKED
            #pragma pack()          /* Revert to default packing */
            #endif  /* RC_INVOKED */

    *  Prevent multiple inclusion of your header file with the following
       construct:

            #ifndef _INC_MYHEADER
            #define _INC_MYHEADER

            ...body of header...

            #endif  /* _INC_MYHEADER */

       This is the convention used by the C runtimes.  For each header there
       is a #define that can be used to determine whether the header has
       already been included.



        Win32 Upward Compatibility
        --------------------------

Part of the goal of 3.1 is to provide a more unified API that will scale with
minimal pain to 32 bits in Win32.  To this end, there are a few things you
have to worry about in your headers (and in your code, but that's a different
story...)

In 32-bit Windows, almost all 16 bit parameters, return values, and field
types have been widened to 32 bits.  This allows us to generate much more
efficient code on the 386 and on RISC machines.

We need a way of declaring the quantities that will "float" to 32 bits in
32-bit Windows.  It turns out that the C language already provides for this
capability: the "int" type, for example, is 16 bits on 16 bit platforms, but
is 32 bits on 32 bit platforms.  "short" is always 16 bits on any platform,
"long" is always 32 bits, and "char" is always 8 bits.

So, functions and structures with "int" declarations are already portably
declared.  The problem, though is with the WORD type.  "WORD" has become an
industry-wide synonym for a 16 bit unsigned quantity.  But, it's also used
widely in Windows header files.

Enter the UINT type.  The new UINT type is typedef'd as "unsigned int": an
unsigned value that is 16 bits on 16 bit platforms, and floats to 32 bits on
32 bit platforms.  In the 3.1 headers, UINT is used in place of WORD wherever
the size of the return value, parameter, or field will change depending on
the platform.

This is a rule that applies to code you write too: on 32 bit platforms, use
of the UINT type rather than WORD will generate faster smaller code.  But be
careful of hard-coded size dependencies on WORD: be sure to use sizeof()
instead of constants, etc.

In some cases there may be structure fields whose size WON'T be changing in
32-bit windows, perhaps because the structure is used in a file format and
compatibility is required.  If you know ahead of time that this is the case,
be sure to use short and WORD to indicate 16 bit quantities across platforms.
There are a few of these exceptions with the 3.1 bitmap information
structures in windows.h.  If you don't know, then use UINT and int.

The new WPARAM, LPARAM, and LRESULT types, used for polymorphic or arbitrary
parameters and return values (e.g., the SendMessage() function), also provide
a useful degree of platform isolation.  The WPARAM type is similar to UINT in
that its size varies with the platform.  WPARAM should be used in function
parameter, return value, AND structure declarations, even though its size may
vary.  The use of these types indicates to the programmer that the value must
be cast and assigned to the proper type before use.

Hence, the following rules:

    *  Use int and UINT instead of short or WORD, UNLESS you know for sure
       that the quantity will remain 16 bits in 32-bit Windows.  The Windows
       HIWORD and LOWORD macros use WORD, for example.  Be sure to check your
       uses of short as well as WORD: there are probably a few lurking out
       there that should be changed to int.  Use int FAR* or UINT FAR* instead
       of LPINT or LPWORD.

    *  Use the LPARAM, WPARAM, and LRESULT types instead of WORD, LONG, or
       DWORD as appropriate.


        ANSI Compatibility
        ------------------

Public header files should be ANSI compliant so that people can take
advantage of the highest compiler warning levels possible.  This also helps
ensure that our header files work with a wider range of development tools.

    *  Don't define constants, typedefs, or functions named with a preceding
       underscore.  This violates the ANSI namespace conventions.  There are
       a few violations of this rule already in existence (e.g., _lread), but
       try not to create any new problems.  (The rules are actually more
       complicated than "don't use underscores", but you're safe if you keep
       away from them).

    *  Don't use "//" style comments in the header: these are convenient
       but non-ANSI, and warning level 4 complains.

    *  Always test your header file by compiling it with the -W4 compiler
       option to ensure that it's ANSI-compatible.

    *  Make sure that you have no identifier conflicts with the following
       C library header files (NOTE: This list may be incomplete.  It's
       a good start, though).

            assert.h
            ctype.h
            errno.h
            float.h
            limits.h
            locale.h
            math.h
            setjmp.h
            signal.h
            stdarg.h
            stddef.h
            stdio.h
            stdlib.h
            string.h
            time.h

    *  Structure declarations should be declared with the "tag" prefix, rather
       than a leading underscore, as shown below:

         typedef struct tagFOO
         {
            int i;
            UINT u;
         } FOO;

    *  Declare fully-prototyped typedefs for all callback functions.  By
       convention, the type name should be all caps and end in PROC. For
       example, the window procedure callback function typedef from windows.h:

        typedef LRESULT (CALLBACK* WNDPROC)(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);

        Windows 3.0 Backward Compatibility
        ----------------------------------

In order to allow users to develop applications with 3.1 headers that will
still run on 3.0, users can #define the WINVER constant to be equal to the
version number of Windows they are compiling against.  For 3.0, this would be
0x0300.  This constant should be used to ensure that new, non-3.0 compatible
features are not declared when the user is compiling a 3.0 application.  Keep
in mind that this version number is hex, not decimal (to be compatible with
the GetExpWinVer() API).

Some of you may own headers that are designed to work with windows 3.0 as
well as 3.1: in this case, you won't have some of the new 3.1 typedefs and
macros defined (e.g., UINT).  You can use #ifdef _INC_WINDOWS to determine
whether you've included the 3.1 windows.h.  Because yours may not be the only
header that will want to define certain types like UINT and LPCSTR, you
should #define these to be WORD and LPSTR, respectively, since you cannot
typedef something twice.  The other option, of course, is to have separate
3.0 and 3.1 versions of your header.

    *  New, non-3.0 compatible declarations and definitions should be inside
       #ifdef (WINVER >= 0x030a)/#endif so that the 3.1 headers can be used
       to create 3.0-compatible applications.

    *  If your header must be compatible with the 3.0 windows.h, use #ifdef
       _INC_WINDOWS around #definitions that define the missing types.  The
       3.0 windows.h file did not #define _INC_WINDOWS.
       Use #define rather than typedef to ensure that other headers can
       safely do the same thing.  Here's an example that will handle
       most of the common problems:

        #ifndef _INC_WINDOWS    /* If not included with 3.1 headers... */
        #define LPCSTR      LPSTR
        #define WINAPI      FAR PASCAL
        #define CALLBACK    FAR PASCAL
        #define UINT        WORD
        #define LPARAM      LONG
        #define WPARAM      WORD
        #define LRESULT     LONG
        #define HMODULE     HANDLE
        #define HINSTANCE   HANDLE
        #define HLOCAL      HANDLE
        #define HGLOBAL     HANDLE
        #endif  /* _INC_WINDOWS */

        C++ Compatibility
        -----------------

To be able to use functions declared in your header directly from C++, you
need to do one thing:

    *  Bracket the header file typedefs inside an extern "c" {} block,
       conditionally using the __cplusplus #define:
       Near the beginning of your header:

        #ifdef __cplusplus
        extern "C" {            /* Assume C declarations for C++ */
        #endif  /* __cplusplus */

       And at the end:

        #ifdef __cplusplus
        }
        #endif


        STRICT Compatibility and Windows 3.0 Backward Compatibility
        -----------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important features of STRICT is that handle types are no
longer defined as WORDs.  They are declared in such a way that will cause a
compiler error if you try to pass the wrong type of handle or a non-handle
value to a function, for example.  It's important that all of our handle
types be declared this way when the user #defines STRICT.

A number of new types and such have been defined in windows.h, such as
HINSTANCE, HGLOBAL, and HLOCAL, which should be used where appropriate in
place of the generic HANDLE type.  HANDLE should be used only in cases of
an arbitrary handle type.

The WPARAM, LPARAM, and LRESULT types should be used for arbitrary or
polymorphic parameters or return values. Typedefs exist for all callback
functions, which are used in place of FARPROC.

In most cases, functions declared with these types are fully 3.0 compatible
unless STRICT is #defined.  It may sometimes be necessary to use #ifdef
STRICT/#else/#endif to provide 3.0-compatible, non-STRICT declarations in
some cases.

    *  Use DECLARE_HANDLE() to declare handle types.  If you have polymorphic
       API parameters (or structure fields) that are designed to accept more
       than one type of handle (e.g., the GDI SelectObject function), there
       are a few tricks you can employ.  1) Declare a generic handle type
       like HGDIOBJ as void _near*, which will accept any handle type. The
       HANDLE type can be used for this purpose.  2) if the number of
       polymorphic types is small, and there are lots of cases where they can
       be used polymorphically, use DECLARE_HANDLE to declare one handle
       type, and typedef the rest to be the same as the first one (e.g,
       HMODULE and HINSTANCE in windows.h).

    *  Structure and function declarations should use the appropriate STRICT
       type, rather than the generic HANDLE,

    *  Declare arbitrarily or polymorphic types with LPARAM, WPARAM, and
       LRESULT instead of WORD, LONG, or DWORD.  This indicates to a
       programmer that these values should not be used directly, but should
       instead be cast and assigned to the proper type of value before use.

    *  Declare arbitrarily or polymorphic pointer types with void FAR*
       instead of LPSTR or BYTE FAR*.  The nice thing about the void FAR*
       type is that you can pass any type of pointer to it without having to
       cast first.

    *  If any of the above STRICT rules result in declarations that are
       not compatible with previously released versions of the header file,
       use #ifdef STRICT/#else/#endif to ensure that both declarations
       are present.

    *  Use WINAPI instead of FAR PASCAL for declaring APIs.  Use CALLBACK
       instead of FAR PASCAL in callback function typedefs.

    *  Be sure to use "const" where appropriate in your pointer parameters.
       If the pointer is read-only, then it should be const.  If the function
       writes through the pointer, it must not be const.  For const
       zero-terminated string pointers, use LPCSTR instead of LPSTR.

    *  Don't declare NPXXX or SPXXX pointer parameter types for new structures.
       (but don't remove them if they've already been defined in a shipped
       header).  Users are encouraged to use "*", const, _near, _far, and
       _huge explicitly where appropriate.  Now that our headers contain
       "const" pointer types, having LP, NP, and const pointer type variants
       for every structure would just clog the compiler up with typedefs.

    *  Spell out pointer declarations, rather than using the LPXXX type form.
       This allows for use of const and _huge where appropriate, without
       having to define lots of new typedefs:

             SetFoo(const FOO FAR* pfoo);
             GetFoo(FOO FAR* pfoo);

    *  Use parameter names in your API function prototypes.  This greatly
       contributes to the readability and usefulness of your header, at
       very little cost.  Make sure all your APIs and callback declarations
       are fully prototyped.  Use the same naming conventions as in our
       documentation (contact gregro or ralphw for a summary of those
       conventions).  NOTE: As of this writing, windows.h does not yet
       include function prototype names.

New Executable Format

DOS 2.0 Windows will define a new executable format for .EXE files
that is a superset of the current DOS 2.0 .EXE format.  The purpose
of this new format is to provide the additional information needed
to support the new dynamic linking and segmentation facilities provided
by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  In order for Windows and DOS 4.0
to recognize the new executable format, the existing .EXE format
will be used with a slight modification:

    - the word at offset 18h in the existing .EXE file contains the
      relative byte offset to the relocation table.  If this offset
      is 40h, then that identifies this as a new format .EXE file and
      The word at offset 24h is the relative byte offset from the
      beginning of the file to the beginning of the new format
      executable header.  The remainder of the old format header will
      describe a small program that will either print an error message
      or bring in a loader that can handle the job.  See the picture
      below for the actual file layout.

    - this format will only be used for .EXE files that use the new
      memory model supported by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  Old .EXE
      files will continue with the DOS 2.0 file format, as modified
      by the DOS 4.0 group.  In that format, the DOS 4.0 behavior bits
      (2 bytes) are stored at offset 20h.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\mvdm\wow16\kernel31\patch.txt ===
This is an overview document describing how to create module patches
in Windows 95.

Legal aspects:
--------------
While we are obviously using this module-patching technology to
make already-shipping apps run or run better, it is possible
for us to make a mistake and wrongly patch a module. For example,
there might be two similar versions of an app which need to be
patched differently, but we only know about one of them. Due to the
obvious liability concerns, we need to obtain authorization from
the app vendor for each module patch we put into the registry.
The letter must specify the name of the module, the number of the
segment taking the patch, the bytes being replaced, and the new
bytes taking their place. The letter can be from any responsible
person at the vendor, eg. an engineer who is familiar with the code.
At the same time, talking to the vendor will help us find out how
many different versions there are of an app, so we can figure out
how to patch each one.

See brianrey if you have a module patch you want to check in.
It would be a good idea to get the ball rolling on getting the
letter as soon as possible after you know what the patch is, since
it can sometimes take a while to get these things taken care of.
We already get similar letters for app-hack bits.


How to check in a patch:
------------------------
Since the patch values go in the registry, and since the initial registry
contents are owned by setup, you must work with Andy Hill to get your
module patches checked in.

A common mistake when adding app-patches to msbase.inx is to leave out
field 4 (field 3 if you are a computer), which are flags.  The reason
for the confusion is the flag that means "This is a binary regkey" is 01,
and the opcode for "Change" is also 01, so everything just shifts down
one step and nobody gets hurt.  Except that the patch doesn't work.
eg: If you want to add a key whose value is <01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15>
WRONG
    HKLM,"SYSTEM\...",Change,01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15
BETTER
    HKLM,"SYSTEM\...",Change,1,01,09,70,00,02,ff,76,eb,15


How to make a patch:
--------------------
All definitions of the structures used below are in core\kernel\patch.asm.

The loader knows to look in the registry for patch data if the MCF_MODPATCH
bit is set in the [ModuleCompatibility] section in win.ini.
eg.
[ModuleCompatibility]
GENERIC=0x0002

All registry keys and values for module-patching are stored
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH:
(from dev\sdk\inc\regstr.h)
#define REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH "System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SessionManager\\AppPatches"

The actual patches are values stored in the registry under
REGSTR_PATH_APPPATCH\<mod_name>\<signature>\<segment_number>
where
    mod_name        = the module name
    signature       = a signature string identifying the module version
    segment_number  = the hex number of the segment receiving the patches


Signatures:
-----------
Signatures are strings of ANSI characters representing hex numbers
in nibble-swapped byte format (what you see in wdeb386 if you type
db). Blanks and commas are ignored, and may be included for readability.

The easiest way to create a signature is to run dev\tools\binw\gensig.
eg. If you want to patch segment 3 in foo.dll, run "gensig foo.exe 3"
and a tight signature will be written to stdout.

type-1 and -2 signatures:
A type-1 signature specifies a list of byte sequences with byte offsets
(type-2 has word offsets) which must all match for the signature to match.
A 0 byte-count marks the end of the list.
A match-any-file signature is "0100".
eg. signature = "01 02,00,4e,45 02,3e,0a,03 00" is a type-1 signature which
                 || || || || || || || || || ||
    type --------++ || || || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || || || ||
    offset-------------++ || || || || || || ||
    match bytes-----------++-++ || || || || ||
                                || || || || ||
    byte count------------------++ || || || ||
    offset-------------------------++ || || ||
    match bytes-----------------------++-++ ||
                                            ||
    terminating byte count------------------++
matches if the 2 bytes starting at offset 0 in the exe header match
4e,45 ("NE") and if the 2 bytes starting at offset 3e match 0a,03.
Note- DO NOT include a match on NE in your signature. This is just
for illustrative purposes. The windows version and size(s) of the
segment(s) being patched are good candidates.


type-3, -4 and -5 signatures:
Type-3, -4 and -5 signatures are similar to type-1 and -2 signatures,
except that the offsets are offsets in the module file. Type-3 takes
word offsets, type-4 takes 3-byte offsets, and type-5 takes dword offsets.
eg. signature = "03,03,67,05,c2,0a,00,00"
                 || || || || || || || ||
    type---------++ || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || ||
    file offset--------++-++ || || || ||
    match bytes--------------++-++-++ ||
                                      ||
    terminating byte count------------++
matches if the 3 bytes at offset 567h in the file match c2,0a,00.


type-6, -7 and -8 signatures:
Type-6, -7 and -8 signatures specify the file size of the matching
module. The number of bytes used to specify the matching file size
is 2, 3 or 4 respectively.
eg. signature = "06,d0,0c"
                 || || ||
    type---------++ || ||
    file size-------++-++
matches if the file size is 0cd0h.


type-ff signatures:
Type-ff signatures are meta-signatures and consist of a list of the
other types of signatures. Each list element consists of a byte count
and a sub-signature. A 0 byte-count ends the list.
eg. signature = "ff 06,01,02,3e,0a,03,00 03,06,d0,0c 00"
                 || || || || || || || || || || || || ||
    type---------++ || || || || || || || || || || || ||
                    || || || || || || || || || || || ||
    byte count------++ || || || || || || || || || || ||
    sub-type-----------++ || || || || || || || || || ||
    sub-byte-count--------++ || || || || || || || || ||
    hExe offset--------------++ || || || || || || || ||
    match bytes-----------------++-++ || || || || || ||
    sub-type terminator---------------++ || || || || ||
                                         || || || || ||
    byte count---------------------------++ || || || ||
    sub-type--------------------------------++ || || ||
    file size----------------------------------++-++ ||
                                                     ||
    terminating byte count---------------------------++
matches if the 2 bytes at offset 3eh in the exe header match 0a,03
and the file size is 0cd0h.


Criteria for selecting a signature:
-----------------------------------
In terms of time required to validate a signature, the hExe types are
the fastest, the file size types are next-fastest, and the file data
types are the slowest. A signature specifying the expected Windows
version (hExe offset 3e) and the file size is probably sufficient
for most cases, since almost any code change changes the file size.
A signature which also requires a file match on the bytes being replaced
(if they are not fixed up and they are in a segment, they must be
somewhere in the file!) is very good, but might be overkill.
Since file match signatures hit the disk, they might noticeably increase
the load time of the module.

DO NOT match on the NE signature in the module header. This is
just a waste of bytes, since it always matches.
DO match on the file size unless you have a very good reason not to.
If going through the ifs, this is a very cheap test.
DO match on something, since we don't want to rely on just the
name of the module. We have signatures. Use them. If you have
no better idea (eg. there is only one version), match on the
windows version, the size(s) of the segment(s) being patched, and
the file size.


Patch data:
-----------
The patch values specify sequences of bytes to add or replace.
Add's must be placed after the end of the unpatched segment.
The segment is GlobalReAlloc'd as necessary to contain the new code.
Replace's must be within the limits of the unpatched segment,
and they must match the sequence of old bytes in the patch value.
Obviously, replaced bytes cannot contain fixups.
The contents of the value string are not used, except to be sent
to the debugger as a debugging aid when the value is loaded from
the registry. The contents of the value data must be in REG_BINARY
format.

Example:
--------
Note: The registry key show below will not work as shown, since it
has been broken into multiple lines for legibility. Join the lines
together and it works.

==================================================================
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\SessionManager
\AppPatches\GENERIC
\ff 06,01,02,3e,0a,03,00 03,06,d0,0c 08,03,03,67,05,c2,0a,00,00 00

"Replace"=hex:01,0b,67,00,03,c2,0a,00,e9,86,03
==================================================================

The Add value has data with a size of 8 bytes, saying that at offset
3f0h that the 3 bytes c2,0a,00 should be added.
    "Add"=hex:02,08,f0,03,03,c2,0a,00
              || || || || || || || ||

offset 67h that the 3 bytes c2,0a,00 should be replaced with e9,86,03.
    "Replace"=hex:01,0b,67,00,03,c2,0a,00,e9,86,03

    new bytes-----------------------------++-++-++

The combined effect of these two changes is to replace a "retn a" at 67
with "jmp 3f0" and, at 3f0 to add "retn a". The app runs exactly as
before in this case, except for a small detour. When it reaches ip=67,
instead of doing "retn a", it does a "jmp 3f0" and then the "retn a".



Example for code segment 1 of module "INSTALL":
We want to change the message number they are checking against in a WndProc
from 181 to 402.   So here's what ya gatta do....

1. Open a patch.ini file in your favorite editor


2. Run private\tools16\gensig.exe :  gensig file.exe seg#
   where seg# is the 1-based HEX value of the segment you want to patch.  You
   will see the correct segment number to use if you do a "vdmexts!lm sel" 
   dump for the selector of interest under ntsd (it will be under the "Seg"
   heading).
      gensig install.exe 1
      ff06010242136500030600d600  <--- resulting hex string signature


3. Grab the resulting hex string & paste it in your patch.ini file with the 
   following format:  RegistryPath\ModuleName\HexSignature\SegNum

\Registry\MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppPatches\INSTALL\ff06010242136500030600d600\1


4. Now the fun part.  The patch bytes list needs to be done in groups of 4 bytes
   because it will be converted to DWORDS later.  

   The first DWORD is the 1-Byte_ByteCount with a bunch of leading zeros:
       0x0000000B  Note: this must match the 1-Byte_ByteCount in the next DWORD
                         See "^^Note:" at the end of this section on how to 
                                     calculate this.

   The second DWORD takes the following format:
      2-Byte_CodeOffset 1-Byte_ByteCount  1-Byte_PatchCode 
        where the 2-Byte_CodeOffset is the same offset you would type to
        disassemble the code under ntsd:  u seg:off
      For this example we want to alter 3 bytes at 1:305 so we need to write:
      0x03050B01 
        \__/\/\/
          \  \ \___ The 1-Byte_PatchCode (01 = "replace")
           \  \____ The 1-Byte_ByteCount (# bytes in the entire patch string)
            \______ The code offset

   Next write a 1-Byte_PatchByteCount followed by the PatchBytes.  For the 3
   bytes we are replacing in this example:
      03 2d 81 01   2d 02 04 00
      \/ \/ \___/   \/ \___/ \/                      ______
       \  \   \      \   \    \___ Zero pad the DWORD      |
        \  \   \      \   \_______ The value "402"         |
         \  \   \      \__________ "Sub" instruction code  |-- PatchBytes
          \  \   \________________ The value "181"         |
           \  \___________________ "Sub" instruction ______|
            \_____________________ 1-Byte_PatchByteCount

       Now DWORD arrange the above 4-byte clusters:
           0x01812d03 0x0004022d

   Put this all together as follows:
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d
                                       \/       \/
                                        \________\__ These two will be the same

            ^^Note: the 1-Byte_ByteCount is the count of the bytes in all of the
                    DWORDS we built except the first one (0x0000000B in this 
                    case) and doesn't count any of the padding zeros in the 
                    last DWORD.  See below:

                                 0 bytes    4 bytes    4 bytes    3 bytes
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d

                1-Byte_ByteCount = 4 + 4 + 3 = 0xB



5. Next add another registry path entry to the "ModuleCompatibility" section:
\Registry\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ModuleCompatibility

   Followed by a REG_SZ entry for the Module:
          INSTALL = REG_SZ "0x0002"
                            \____/
                               \____ use "0x0002" for WOW in general
                                     and "0x8000" for RISC WOW only


6. The resulting patch.ini file should look like this:

\Registry\MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppPatches\INSTALL\ff06010242136500030600d600\1
          Change1 = REG_BINARY 0x0000000B 0x03050B01 0x01812d03 0x0004022d

\Registry\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ModuleCompatibility
          INSTALL = REG_SZ "0x0002"


7. Run "regini patch.ini" to update the registry

8. Install a checked krnl386 and run the app under ntsd to see any patching
   messages when the module loads.  If you have any problems set a bp at
   PatchAppSegWorker in krnl386 (source: wow16\kernel31\patch.asm) and step
   through what's going on.  Chances are you have the byte order mixed up and
   you can see how you will need to re-arrange the PatchBytes in patch.ini 
   to get what you really want.

This directory contains a special version of the kernel program for Microsoft Windows. By running this special version, called SKERNEL, you can get an accurate accounting of all calls, swaps, discards, and swap returns that occur during a Windows session. Reviewing the information provided by SKERNEL will allow you to develop the most efficient code segmentation scheme for your application.


What You Need to Run SKERNEL
----------------------------

To analyze the swapping activity for your application, you need the following:

1. A special version of the kernel, usually called SKERNEL.EXE and the corresponding symbol file, SKERNEL.SYM.

2. A utility program named SWAP.EXE that analyzes the swap information.

3. Symbol files for the modules you want information about.


How to Use Swap and SKERNEL
---------------------------

To set up Windows and your application for swapping analysis, follow the steps below.

1. Set up a "slow boot" version of Windows, and copy SKERNEL.EXE from this disk to your Windows directory.

1. In the win.ini file, set the SwapProfile variable found in the [kernel] section as follows:

0 = do nothing (acts just like a normal kernel except that thunks will be slightly larger and slower)

1 = record just swap calls, discards, and swap returns

2 = record swap calls, discards, swap returns, and all calls through thunks. Warning: This setting generates a very large amount of data.

If a value is not specified, 1 is assumed.

2. Start SKERNEL.

3. Run the application program that you want to analyze.

4. Exit from Windows.

5. Run SWAP.EXE.  


How SWAP Works
--------------

Swap reads a file named SWAPPRO.DAT that was created while the Windows session was running and combines it with the information found in the symbol files to produce the desired information. Swap then displays a tab delimited file to the screen. The output can also be redirected into a file and then read into a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.

If SWAPPRO.DAT contains a large amount of data, it will take SWAP quite a long time to look up all the module and symbol names. To limit the size of SWAPPRO.DAT (and therefore the time required to match names), you can specify the modules and segments for which SWAP should prepare output. To specify the modules and segments, type the following argument on the command line:

		[module[:segment]]

For example,

		swap gdi:_fontres 

displays only records that contain the _FONTRES segment of GDI. 

You can list multiple modules or module/segment pairs on the command line. Just separate them from each other with spaces.  For example,

		swap gdi:_fontres user

displays records that contain the _FONTRES segment of GDI or any segment of USER.

If you wish to track swap information for SKERNEL, as well as other modules, copy SKERNEL.SYM to your Windows directory, and rename it KERNEL.SYM.

If you have renamed SWAPPRO.DAT (the data collection file) or moved it to another directory since running your application, you can specify the path and filename with the -f command line argument. For example, if you have moved SWAPPRO.DAT to the \tmp directory and renamed it SWAPREC, type the following command to run the Swap program:

		swap -f \tmp\swaprec

What the Output Means
---------------------

The result of SWAP's analysis is displayed on the screen in tabular format. The columns are, from left to right:

Column			Explanation
------              -----------

Type				Tells which kind of event occurred. 
				CALL    = a normal call through a thunk.
				SWAP    = a call through a thunk that 
				          caused a swap
				DISCARD = discard of a segment
				RETURN  = return that caused a swap in 
				          of the caller

				If the segment discard was the result of 
				a swap, then the discard records will 
				occur after the swap record.

Time				The relative time that this event 
				occurred, in milliseconds, with 1/18.2

We never have built OLECLI.DLL for WOW.

Until NT 5, we just distributed the Win 3.1 version.

On NT 5, we distribute the Win '98 version.

The difficulty is that nobody seems to know how this gets built,
from what sources it was built, or the tools used to build it -- 
not even the Win'98 folks who built the Win'98 version (scary huh?).

So for now the Win '98 binary is just checked into the 
private\mvdm\bin86 dir with the respective FE Win '98 versions.

This document is intended to provide preliminary information on Sherlock, a system diagnostic tool.  The purpose of Sherlock is to diagnose the cause of system errors.  Currently, when an application fails, the system provides a simple dialog box:

UNRECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERROR
Terminating Current Application
OK

This doesn't supply enough information to find and fix the problem.  If a user gets too many UAE errors, they can install Sherlock in windows.  Sherlock will generate a special file on disk with information that will help technicions fix the problem.
Installing Sherlock
Make sure SHERLOCK.DLL is in your windows or windows\system directory.  Make sure SHERLOCK.EXE is in your windows or windows\system directory.
Add SHERLOCK.EXE to your LOAD= or RUN= line in WIN.INI.  Alternatively, use ProgMan or FileMan to run Sherlock.  You will see the Sherlock icon on your desktop.
Using Sherlock
When a system error occurs, such as Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE), Sherlock will write a special file in your windows\system directory.  By default, this file will have a large amount of information.  You can reduce the size of this file by instructing Sherlock to skip certain less-important information.
By default, this report is called "SHERLOCK.LOG".  You can change the name and location of this file by adding a "logfile=" entry to the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.  You can also redirect output to a serial or parallel device.  For example, to send reports to a debugging terminal, add this line:
[sherlock]
logfile=com1
Report Format
Each section of a Sherlock report can be disabled by adding it to the "skipinfo=" entry of the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.  For example, to disable the module list output of a report, add this line:
[sherlock]
skipinfo=module
Sherlock Report Header
The first section of the report indicates the Sherlock software version (0.7), time and date of event, the fault type ('Invalid Opcode'), selector:offset of the fault, and segment number and file name of the current application.

Sherlock 0.7 Failure Report - Fri Apr  5 21:39:16 1991
Elementary - a 'Invalid Opcode' fault has occured at 0df5:0416.
This is from segment 1 of 'C:\TEMP\DIBTEST.EXE' (DIBTEST)
The cause appears to be 'Invalid Opcode'.

This part of the report is mandatory, it cannot be disabled.
CPU Registers
The 16 bit CPU registers, segment registers linear base address and limit, whether the selectors are Code, Data, or NULL.  This section is important, but you can disable it by adding "skipinfo=regs" to the [SHERLOCK] section of WIN.INI.

CPU Registers (regs)
ax = 000f  bx = 0000  cx = 0004  dx = 0103  si = 0094  di = 0094  bp = 1702

ss:sp = 0dfd:16ec  80539560:277f Data R/W     es = 0000         0:0000 Null Ptr 

32 Bit CPU Registers
If the CPU is a 386 or 486, the 32 bit register contents will be displayed, unless "skipinfo=32bit" is added to WIN.INI.

CPU 32 bit Registers (32bit)
eax = 0000000f  ebx = ffff0000  ecx = 03040004  edx = 00000103
esi = 00000094  edi = 00000094  ebp = 00001702  esp = 800116ec
fs = 0000         0:0000 Null Ptr     gs = 0000         0:0000 Null Ptr 
eflag = 00000202

Disassembly
The instructions before and after the faulting instruction are disassembled.  In this case, an illegal opcode was executed in the application, and so it is disassembled as an unknown instruction.  This section can be disabled with "skipinfo=disasm".  The faulting instruction is marked with the (module name:symbol+offset) of that address.  This last feature requires the presence of a .SYM file with debugging symbols in the same directory as the associated .EXE file.

Stack Dump/Trace
The stack dump shows stack frames, letting you know the calling sequence that produced the fault.  The example shows that function GPFault was called by DoCommand, which was called by MAINWNDPROC, called by USER:DISPATCHMESSAGE, called by WINMAIN.  The CS:IP and SS:SP of the stack frame are also displayed.

Other Reports
At this point, Sherlock's GP Fault decoding logic is incomplete.  We detect many possible GP faults, but not all.  Examples we detect are null pointer usage, writing to code segments, segment limit violations, divide by zero.  Other faults may occur that display as "Unable to detect."  Let us know if that is a problem for you.
Here are some other sample fault displays.  They were generated with the WIN.INI entry  "skipinfo=info, modules, tasks, stack, 32bit".

Building user16:

If you don't have USER sources that match the build you're testing on,
and you're building x86 free, you will want to use:

nmake NONX86=1

which will build a version which does not embed copies of user32.dll
code into user.exe.

When you're building checked or on RISC, this is a non-issue.

                                                     ** 21-January-1988

        MS-WRITE for version 2.0 of Windows is a weird bird in that it 
cannot be compiled with standard tools (ie: MASM 5.0 etc.).  You will
need to set up a separate environment from which to make it using the 
tools in the \WRITE\TOOLS subdirectory.  We are sorry for this inconvenience
and will attempt to remedy this in future versions of MS-WINDOWS.

Sincerely,

OEM Support Group

                                                     ** 27-February-1989
                                                        pault

I am trying to remove the above restriction.  The Win "DEV" SLM project is
being used to build MS-WRITE for Windows 3.0, currently without problems.
Make sure autoexec references are made/added as follows:
        set path=\dev;\dev\tools
        set include=\dev\inc
        set lib=\dev\lib

WRITE is the makefile for this project.  DO NOT USE MAKEFILE -- I do not
know where it came from or why it's here, and of course we may learn that
things are not currently as rosy as we believe, but this is how I *THINK*
the product has been made in the past...
        
        MAKE WRITE              MAKE "DEBUGDEF=-DDEBUG" "DFLAGS=/Zd" WRITE
        builds the standard     builds a debugging version
        release version

        
                                                     ** 28-March-1989
                                                        pault

The above procedure was not generating quite the same WRITE.EXE as we've 
previously had (Win 2.x).  In talking with anyone who's ever been involved
at all, this is the information I have learned:

   1. Nobody wants this product or claims responsibility for it.
   2. It has been a nightmare for everyone who has worked on, with,
      or around it. 
   3. The international version was incorporated at some time during
      2.x and is now "built in".
   4. There was at one time an online help system designed which was 
      never included in a shipped version.
   5. The 6 or 8 batch files, .libs, and makefiles "makefile" and 
      "wrtmake" are for the 2.x version; since we have since grown up 
      I am removing them...
   6. The K*.* files (or *.K* files) apply to the Kanji make process and
      they have N-O-T been updated yet, but are being left in the project
      (i.e. they must be modified or add to the "write" makefile).  Also
      see the file EDM.EDM (hey, file naming is our specialty here at MS).
   
I have made mods to the project and "write" makefile to incorporate the
subtle changes from 2.x.  Variations of the make process are/will be 
documented inside the makefile.

        
                                                     ** 8-June-1989
                                                        pault

In order to ease localization of this product, all string-related info
in GLOBDEFS.H should really be moved to WRITE.RC because that's where

Due to major changes in Write.rc and the split into Write.dlg, whoever
takes on the task of localization to Intl or Kanji should be sure to
start over with the new Write.rc and Write.dlg.

I've just made a major revision with regard to font handling in Write.
The first one was to make sure that the endmark is always displayed in
the system font.  The Kanji version already ensured this so I grouped
all the code concerning this under the define 'SYSENDMARK', and enabled
it in the Z version.

The second one was to revamp font enumeration... (under 'NEWFONTENUM')

Old method: Call EnumFonts to get a list of fonts available, and "filter 
            out" fonts which did not match our desired aspect ratio (based 
            on the overall display dimensions).  In addition, any fonts 
            which were not the ANSI character set (i.e. the tmCharSet or 
            lfCharSet fields in the TEXTMETRICS and LOGFONT structures, 
            respectively) were "swallowed".  A specific byproduct of this 
            was that screen fonts such as Modern, Script, Symbol, etc.
            could not be used in Write.

New method: Call EnumFonts to get a list of fonts available.  No filtering-
            out is done.  The major problem here became an issue with the
            Write file format: the font name and font family are stored in
            the document but naturally not the appropriate character set 
            value (since only ANSI had been previously allowed).  So now
            when we read a new document in, we enumerate all the fonts and
            then for each font in the doc we try to match up the correct
            character set value.  

            This slows things down ever-so-slightly and we also have the 
            possibility of getting confused if someone names a font of one
            character set the same as one of a different character set, but 
            there wasn't much alternative -- it was either make this kind
            of guess or revise the file format which would have created a
            lot more problems at this point.

FernandD has worked on the localization issue mentioned above and checked
in changes for Rel 1.46

One change involved in the above NEWFONTENUM was to use FORM1.C instead 
of the (presumably) faster FORMAT.ASM.  So this sparks the idea to keep
a list of some performance ideas for future use...

done?   task
-----   ----
        1) handcode critical routines (including the use format.asm 
           instead of form1.c)
        2) make use of register vars
        3) chipa suggests breaking up really large segments, and eliminating
           very small ones
  X     4) remove inefficient lockdown of dialog procs, etc.  not sure
           why this is currently done but it forces a large amount of 
           code to be fixed at write startup, and this hampers the general
           idea of movable segments in a winapp!
        5) remove use of C run-time libs

                                                     ** 25-October-1989

It has just been decided to remove support for ExtDeviceMode from Write
(primarily because none of the other apps had it!)  This means that when
you change Printer.Setup inside Write, that affects the global Windows
printer settings (rather than just those for the current Write session).

readme for genwowit.exe

This tool generates two source files for wow32, wowit.c and wowit.h,
from the input file wow.it.  wow.it contains one pseudo-prototype
for each API we want to have an interpreted thunk for.  The program
converts these psuedo-prototypes into interpreted thunk byte streams
in wowit.c's InstrSwamp byte array, and entries in wowit.c's
IntThunkTable which point to the API and the thunk instruction stream.
The psuedo-prototypes can have two names separated by an equals sign,
indicating the 16-bit API name on the left is thunked to the 32-bit
API name on the right.

The bytecode instruction streams consist of 0 or more argument conversion
opcodes, which don't have the high bit (0x80) set, followed by a return
code conversion opcode, which does have the high bit set.

genwowit tries to keep InstrSwamp as small as possible by pointing
multiple interpreted thunks at the same instruction stream when they
share prototypes (args & retval types).  See for example below how
UpdateColors, StartPage, EndPage, and GetTextCharacterExtra all
use the first instruction stream because they all take a GDI handle
and return an int.

Further, genwowit will point into the middle of an existing instruction
stream if it contains the instruction stream it needs.  For example see
below how the wowit.c IntThunkTable GetRasterizerCaps entry points to
InstrSwamp + 0xb, which is 3 bytes into the instruction stream for
TextOut, because ignoring the first three TextOut args they have the
same prototype.

An example, here's a tiny wow.it and the wowit.h and wowit.c that result.

----- wow.it begin
INT   UpdateColors(HGDI);
INT   StartPage(HGDI);
INT   EndPage(HGDI);

DWORD GetTextColor(HGDI);

INT   SetTextJustification(HGDI, INT, INT);

readme for interpreted thunks

Interpreted Thunks are an attempt to replace the simplest thunk functions
in WOW with a bit of data.  Each thunk consists of a pointer to the Win32
API routine (actually to a callable loader thunk in one of the pages set
aside for fixups if needed) and a pointer to a variable-length byte stream
which dictates how to convert arguments and return values.  The first byte
is an opcode indicating how to thunk the leftmost argument, the last byte
is distinguished by having its high bit set (0x8?) and indicates how to
thunk the return value.

A tool called genwowit reads a source file called wow.it which contains
psuedo-prototypes (really thunk descriptions) and generates wowit.h
and wowit.c with the actualy thunk table and assiociated instruction
"swamp" containing all the bytecode instruction streams.  See
\nt\private\sdktools\genwowit\readme.txt for details.

Note that the major restriction of interpreted thunks as implemented is
that pointers to structures which need thunking are not supported.

Here's a tiny wow.it and the wowit.h and wowit.c that result.

How to add a new thunk table for a new 16-bit thunk DLL:

 - modify wow16\kernel31\kernel.def and add an export similar to __MOD_KERNEL
   rebuild the 16-bit libraries  (nmake in mvdm\wow16\lib)

 - modify the Thunk macro in inc\wow.h and add another externA
   update the MOD_ constants in wow.h, the profiling code still uses them.
   regenerate wow.inc

 - update kernel31\kdata.asm and add another MOD_ variable

 - declare and make public a new __MOD_ value for exporting  (ldboot.asm)

 - create the table (.h file) for inclusion into wowtbl.c

 - wowtbl.h  - add a field to the tableoffsets structure

 - wowtbl.c  - #include the table into aw32WOW and update apszModNames,
    InitThunkTableOffsets, ModFromCallID, and TableOffsetFromName

 - update makefile.inc with the new dependency

Conventions:

    BUGBUG - usual meaning

    PERFNOTE    - place where we should write some code to be more
                  time or space efficient, but which functions correctly
                  as is today.

    WARNNOTE    - some code that "works", but may someday break.
                  (a bugbug that we aren't going to fix)

                  OR - code that works reliably, but has behavior
                        that people may not like.



Build Products:

    config.lib  - linked into ntoskrnl.exe

    bconfig.lib - linked into boot loader (ntldr, osloader)

    uconfig.lib - linked into tools in sdktools\regini

    sconfig.lib - linked into setup

Assigned Node Type Codes

Most system structures start off with a two byte identifier.  Some components
refer to this as a NodeTypeCode.  To make development and debugging easier each
each component is assigned a range of type code values.


The following table is used to keep track of assigned type code values used
by various system components.


0x0100

0x0200  0x02f9 - 0x02ff CACHE

0x0300  0x0301 - 0x0309 CDFS

0x0400  0x0401 - 0x0408 NPFS

0x0500  0x0500 - 0x050b FASTFAT

0x0600  0x0600          RAW
        0x0601 - 0x0608 MAILSLOT

0x0700  0x0700 - 0x070e CNTFS

Locking Rules for Po interface code

1.  The Dope structure and all elements in it
    or referred to by it, including idle, notify,
    and channel structures, are protected by a
    global lock named PopDopeGlobalLock.
    use PopLockDopeGlobal and PopUnlockDopeGlobal.

    EXCEPTION:  PoSetDeviceBusy is allowed to wack
                directly on the IdleCount variable.


2.  The Irp serial list is protected by the
    PopIrpSerialLock, accessed via
    PopLockIrpSerialList and PopReleaseIrpSerialList,
    note that the later does NOT lower IRQL.
    PowerFlags (sys state, dev state, pend, active) are
    also protected by the irpserial list lock.

3.  Notify network protected by eresource named PopNotifyLock,
    dope/notify data protected by the DopeGlobalLock.

4.  Lock order:
        PopNotifyLock, DopeGlobalLock, IrpSerialLock.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntos\po\notes.txt ===
Questions:
    If we send an inrush IRP to A (which is inrush) and A sends it on
    to B, which is not (so we'll process it normally), does anything weird happen?

Driver Rules:
    1.  Must call PoCallDriver for IRP_MJ_POWER regardless
        of the minor code.

    3.  When a driver has received a power irp, and wishes to pass it
        on to other drivers, the following rules apply.

        a.  The SystemContext field must be copied into the next stack location.

        b.  if a driver passes a given irp on to multiple parallel drivers
            (for example, an FT driver that calls multiple disk drivers with
            a single request) then the driver must pass the power irp on to
            each driver one at a time.  it could pass on multiple copies in
            parallel, but if and only if they are not INRUSH.

    4.  If a single irp's stack of functions contains both Power functions and
        non-power functions, the SystemContext field must be propogated accross
        the non-power functions.

        Example:

            driver A gets MJ_PNP_POWER, MN_SET_POWER, incoming SystemContext = s0

            A calls B with MJ_IOCTL, MN..., to get B to do some side function
            associated with powering down (flushing a hardware cache, say)

            B calls C with MJ_POWER, MN_SET_POWER, ...

            Then A must pass SystemContext on to B, which must pass it on to C
            (via a call to PoCallDriver)  PoCallDriver may modify the SystemContext
            that was passed in, so that C gets a different one.

        If this is not done, when the power IRP is passed to C, PoCallDriver won't
        know it's a continuation of a previous IRP, and therefore may do the wrong
        thing.

        (For example, if A and C have INRUSH set, and B doesn't pass on the
            SystemContext value passed into A, then when B does PoCallDriver(C, irp)
            it will be enqueued forever because PoCallDriver thinks it is
            another, different, inrush irp.)

    5.  Any code that fills in a stack location with the first Power function
        of that IRP's stack must set SystemContext to 0.

@@  inrush will lead to deadlocks if two inrush DOs are ever in the same
    stack
!!> special context rules allow an irp to flow up and down a stack,
    need to be sure this is well doc'd.
    if a driver has D0_INRUSH set, and an INRUSH irp arrives, that irp
    might get held up waiting for some other irp to clear in that driver.
    (e.g. some other driver power state irp that didn't set power TO D0
          might hold up all inrush irps in the system)
    if DO is marked inrush, we will always call it at DPC level, just
    to avoid confusion over what is pageable and what is not.

    inrush applies only to device irps, or to device irps and system irps?
    if the later, then an inrush DO can only ever see one irp at time regardless
    of type!!!
!!> driver can receive a SystemPowerState irp even while INRUSH is locked.

!!> when calling any driver that does not set PAGE or INRUSH, we must call
    it from a worker thread at IRQL 0, regardless of where PoCallDriver was called.
    if it is an INPAGE device, we must call it from DPC at IRQL 2.
    not sure about INRUSH, I think it's at DPC too.

??  how will MN_POWER_SEQUENCE and MN_WAIT_WAKE fit into all this?

DOE content

    The contents of the DOE are 100% private.  There is a special
    declaration that allows the PoSetDeviceBusy() call to be a macro.
    (Actually, best if PoSetDeviceBusy() takes a system returned pointer,
     then there are no longer any fixed offsets to worry about.)

    The idea is that any value not needed by every DO is stored in a
    power control block (POB).  Any operation that might allocate this
    object must allow for failure of the allocation!!!


SPEC NOTES:
    Any operation that might allocate a POB must allow for failure to allocate.
    None of the DOE data is public.


Power irp rules.  Allowed one DevicePowerState and one SystemPowerState
irp at a time.

Context Values:
    If low order bit of the context field is 1, it is a flag.
    If 0, it is a pointer.
    If the whole thing is null, then no value.
    So:
        if (SystemContext == 0)
            no context set
        else if (SystemContext & 1)
            test for flag values
        else
            it's a pointer to some structure

    (need to change some code to match this.)

IRP Queues:
    Use a single global holding queue.  When a DO is busy, the IRP is
    enqueued on the tail of this queue.  Whenever a power IRP completes
    AND the "pending" bit is set, run the entire list looking for an
    IRP of that type for that DO, and dispatch it to the DO if we find it.

    This means that each DOE has only 2 bits to mark S and D active,
    and 2 bits to mark S and D pending.

    If we search the entire list and do not find any Irps for that DO,
    then the pending bit is cleared along with the active one.


Power IRPs, Inrush, and copying
    Globally, only one IRP is allowed to be active on any INRUSH DO in
    the system at any time.

    Active and Pending bits have different meanings for INRUSH DevObj
    than for normal devobj.
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntos\wmi\sample\wmilib\readme.txt ===
This directory contains a sample PnP upper filter driver whose only 
purpose is to provide WMI data blocks. Typically driver writers will copy the 
sample code into their own driver and make any minor modifications so that the
WMI data blocks are always available when the driver is loaded. Alternatively
WmiSamp can be left as a filter driver if WMI data blocks should only be made
available when the filter driver is loaded. Drivers that link to classpnp.sys
should use a similar library that is part of classpnp.

    WMI enabling a driver with the sample code consists of doing 5 things:

1. Determining what data needs to be provided and organize it into data blocks
   that contain related data items. For example packets sent and bytes sent
   could be part of a single data block while transmit errors could be part
   of a data block that contains other error counts. Determine if the device
   needs notifications of when to enable and disable collections in the case
   of data blocks that impose a performance hit to collect.

2. Write a Managed Object Format (.mof) file that describes the data blocks. 
   In doing this the driver writer will need to run the guidgen tool to 
   create globally unique guids that are assigned to the data blocks. Guidgen
   *MUST* be run so that no two data blocks will have the same guid. Reference
   the .bmf file (.bmf files are created when mof files are compiled by the 
   mofcomp tool) in the driver's .rc file so that the .bmf file data is 
   included as a resource of the driver's .sys file. WmiLib hardcodes the 
   resource name as MofResourceName.

3. Build the GUIDREGINFO structure with the guids for the data blocks defined
   in the .mof file. If the device wants to be notified of when to start and
   stop collection of a data block the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag should be
   set for the data block in the GUIDREGINFO structure.

4. Implement the 6 WMI function callback routines and reference them in a 
   WMI_INFO structure.


    The sample code supports does not support more than one instance of a 
data block for each device, that is a single device object can only supply
one instance of a data block. Drivers that create multiple device objects
will supply multiple instances for a data block (ie, 1 data block per device
object).

    The sample code does not support dynamic instance names. Instance names 
are statically defined when device registers with WMI. The PQUERY_WMI_REGINFO
callback allows the device to specify a unique instance name for the device or
the PDO for the device. If the PDO is specified then WMI will translate it to 
the device instance name and use that as the unique instance name.

    All data blocks registered for a device will use the same instance name.
That is different data blocks for a device object cannot specify different 
instance names.

    The sample code can be extended to overcome these limitations if the need
arises, however this sample code should be sufficient for most applications.

    All WMI callback functions that pass the irp as a parameter are 
responsible to call WmiLibCompleteRequest when the request has been satisfied
so that the IRP can be completed. If the WMI callback function cannot 
complete the request immediately it can mark the irp pending and return
STATUS_PENDING, but it must call WmiLibComnpleteRequest when the request 
actually finishes.

    The sample code uses a simple linear search to determine the guid index
for any guid passed. If a driver provides a long list of guids then 
WmiLibFindGuid may need to be updated to use a better searching mechanism.

    WmiLib counts on a number of fields being present in the device extension
in order for it to process the WMI requests. See Wmilib.h for their 
description.

    Finally the sample code uses a static global variable to store the 
values for the data block. This is not quite correct since each device object
will typically have its own set of data that composes its instance of a 
data block. Really the global variable should be part of the device extension,
however I did not want to confuse the device extension with extra stuff.

Migrating the user state of an organization's computers typically means handling the special applications, folders, and settings specific to the organization. For the User State Migration Tool (USMT), that means customization of the INF files. This document covers the supported INF commands for USMT. This document does not cover USMT usage scenarios, migration planning, and USMT tool documentation. The main focus of this document is how to create new INF files and how to customize existing INF files. This documentation refers only to USMT version 2.5, which released with the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 family for use with Windows XP. The Anatomy of an INF An INF file is the set of rules that USMT and the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard (FASTWiz) use to migrate a user s state. The command-line tools, Scanstate.exe and Loadstate.exe, can use multiple INF files. Sample INF file listings in this document may have line wraps due to margin limitations. If you view this document in Microsoft  Word, please turn on paragraph marks to view the line breaks. Components and Individual State The INF file describes components and individual state, and the rules for migrating them. Individual state is the state not associated with a component. Some examples of individual state include a specific registry setting, file, file type, or folder. A component is a set of related rules that define the state for one item. For example, an application s state, Accessibility Settings, or Classic Desktop can be a component. Both individual state and components are important to a successful migration, and most INF files have both. When dealing with elements of state that clearly belong together, it is good to take the extra steps to make them a component. Components can be exposed to the user through  Settings  in FASTWiz. Components are also easy blocks to include or exclude for sub-groups in the deployment. INF Template The example below incorporates all of the possible sections. It is not a valid sample INF file. [Version] Signature = $Windows NT$ [Applications] <App Section Name>,  Display Name Acrobat Reader 40, %acroread40% [Acrobat Reader 40.Environment] ; %VarName% = <Type>, <Object Name> %PhotoshopSuite6Path% = Registry, HKLM\Software\Adobe\Photoshop\6.0\ApplicationPath [] [Acrobat Reader 40.Detect] ; How I detect the app is installed on the source, and destination ; Each of these lines are ANDed together ; <Type>, <Object Name>, <Attributes> Registry, HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Adobe Acrobat 4.0 [UninstallString], EXISTS Registry, HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Adobe Acrobat 4.0 [ProductId], !EXISTS [Acrobat Reader 40.Detect.1] ; If you have a x.Detect.1 you do NOT have a x.Detect section for this app ; If either this OR x.Detect.n is true, then the app is installed ; There can be any number of x.Detect.# sections [Acrobat Reader 40.Detect.2] ; If you have this section you also have a x.Detect.1 and not a x.Detect section for this app ; If either this OR x.Detect.1 is true, then the app is installed [Acrobat Reader 40.Instructions] Copy This State  section which only executes if the .Detect evaluates to true (or is absent) ; INFRule = AppName.SectionName DestDelReg = Acrobat Reader 40.DestDelReg AddReg = Acrobat Reader 40.AddReg [Acrobat Reader 40.DestDelReg] HKR\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\4.0\AdobeViewer [AllowOpenFile] [Acrobat Reader 40.Addreg] HKR\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\4.0\AdobeViewer [AllowOpenFile] [Acrobat Reader 40] Copy this State  section which always executes regardless of the .Detect section ; (This assumes Acrobat Reader 40 is listed in the Applications section)  [Copy This State] ; INFRule = AppName.SectionName CopyFiles = SampleCopyFileSection [SampleCopyFileSection] DIR=C:\Data\* *.FSW, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% [Strings] acroread40 = "Adobe Acrobat Reader"  [Version] Section Required Only one per INF Specific to individual INFs Each INF needs to have one and only one [Version] section. The [Version] section must always be the same. It contains one line, a signature line. Parameters Signature Always $Windows NT$. [Version] Signature = $Windows NT$ [Applications] Section Optional Only one per INF Combined across INFs The [Applications] section lists all of the components that USMT understands. Each line is a separate component. The syntax for a detail line is: Component Section Name,  Display Name Parameters Component SectionName Unique for each component across all INF files used. Each INF file s [Applications] section is combined, and Component Section Name must be unique across all used. If it is not unique, each of the lines in the component s sections are combined with other similar sections. (For example, if there are two MyApp components listed, and each has a [.Detect] section, the lines in each of the [.Detect] sections combine into a single [.Detect] section.) Display Name Can use an INF string variable defined in the [Strings] section. Using string variables makes it easier to localize the displayed strings in the INF file. [Applications] Acrobat Reader 40, %acroread40% [Strings] acroread40 = "Adobe Acrobat Reader" [System Settings] Section Optional Only one per INF file Combined across INF files The [System Settings] section lists all of the components that USMT understands. Each line is a separate component. The syntax for a detail line is: Component Section Name,  Display Name Parameters Component SectionName Unique for each component across all INF files used. Each INF file s [System Settings] section is combined, and Component Section Name must be unique across all used. If it is not unique, each of the lines in the component s sections are combined with other similar sections. (For example, if there are two MyApp components listed, and each has a [.Detect] section, the lines in each of the [.Detect] sections combine into a single [.Detect] section.) Display Name Can use an INF string variable defined in the [Strings] section. Using string variables makes it easier to localize the displayed strings in the INF file. [System Settings] Accessibility, %accessibility% [Strings] accessibility = "Accessibility"  [User Settings] Section Optional Only one per INF file Combined across INF files The [User Settings] section lists all of the components that USMT understands. Each line is a separate component. The syntax for a detail line is: Component Section Name,, dir, %CSIDL_NAME% Parameters Component SectionName Unique for each component across all INF files used. Each INF file s [User Settings] section is combined, and Component Section Name must be unique across all used. If it is not unique, each of the lines in the component s sections are combined with other similar sections. (For example, if there are two MyApp components listed, and each has a [.Detect] section, the lines in each of the [.Detect] sections combine into a single [.Detect] section.) %CSIDL_NAME% The CSIDL_NAME represents the folder that the component refers to. [User Settings] Desktop Items,, dir,%csidl_desktopdirectory% [.Environment] Section Optional Only one per component section Unique for given component across INF files The [.Environment] section is used to create temporary environment variables for use in the component s sections. These are primarily used to determine the installation path of either the application or a specific sub-folder for the application (for example, plug-ins). The variable created here can then be used later with an INF rule to migrate specific files to a specific folder, regardless of the application installed in a different folder on the destination. This component section is processed first, even before [.Detect] sections. The syntax for a detail line is: %VARIABLENAME% = Type, Object Name Parameters VARIABLENAME Follows the naming rules for an environment variable. It must be unique across INF files. Can be one of the following: Description Registry The environment variable is set to the value of the registry setting specified by Object Name. Directory The environment variable is set to the folder of the path given using Object Name. INIFile The environment variable is set to the value of the setting specified by Object Name. Object Name Has a specific meaning for each of the Types. Meaning of Object Name Registry RegistryRoot\RegistryKey [SettingName]. [] denotes the (Default) value. Directory <Drive:>\Folder. UNC paths are also supported. INIFile <Drive:>\Folder\filename.ini/section/setting. UNC paths are also supported. More information on Types and Object Names is given below in  Types, Object Names, and Attributes." [Acrobat Reader 40.Environment] %PhotoshopSuite6Path% = Registry, HKLM\Software\Adobe\Photoshop\6.0\ApplicationPath [] [.Detect] Section Optional  Only one per component Unique for given component The [.Detect] section is used to determine if the component is present on the source and destination computers. If the [.Detect] section is omitted, it is assumed that the component is present and the component s [.Instructions] section is executed. If there is a [.Detect] section, each of the lines in the [.Detect] section is evaluated and then ANDed together. In order for the component to be detected, each of the lines in the [.Detect] section must be true. There are also [.Detect.n] sections which are ORed together. See below for more details on the [.Detect.n] sections. The [.Detect] section improves performance by not processing rules for components that are not installed. The [.Detect] section also makes the FASTWiz UI less confusing for the user because components not detected on the user s system will not be listed as a component to be migrated. The syntax for a detail line is: Type, Object Name, Attributes Parameters Can be one of the following: Description Registry A value of the registry setting specified by Object Name. Directory A folder of the path specified using Object Name. A file specified by Object Name. System An operating system. Object Name Is specific to the Type. Meaning of Object Name Registry RegistryRoot\RegistryKey [SettingName]. [] denotes the (Default) value. Directory <Drive:>\Folder. UNC paths are also supported. <Drive:>\Folder\Filename.ext. UNC paths are also supported. System OS.Version Name.SubVersion. Attributes Can be one of the following for any Type (except as noted below): Attribute Value Exists TRUE if Object Name exists. Applies to: Registry, Directory, System, File, INIFile SameObjectName(ObjName) TRUE if ObjName equals Object Name. Applies to: Registry, Directory, File, INIFile SameObjectContent(ObjName) TRUE if the content of ObjName and Object Name are equal. Applies to: Registry, INIFile Matches(Value) TRUE if Value equals the content of Object Name. Applies to: Registry, INIFile Version(Field, Pattern) TRUE if the version number of the FILE object to which Object Name points matches the version specified. Field is the name of the field containing the version information. Pattern indicates the string pattern to match. Applies to: File, Registry If it is a Registry object, its value must point to a file. Each attribute can be changed to NOT (or FALSE) by adding an exclamation point (!) to the beginning. For example, !EXISTS means does not exist. More information on Types, Object Names, and Attributes is given below in  Types, Object Names, and Attributes. [Acrobat Reader 40.Detect] Registry, HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Adobe Acrobat 4.0 [UninstallString], EXISTS Registry, HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Adobe Acrobat 4.0 [ProductId], !EXISTS [.Detect.n] Section Optional (For more information, read the description below.) The [.Detect.n] sections are similar to the [.Detect] section. All of the lines in a given [.Detect.n] section are ANDed together. The big difference is that the [.Detect.n] sections are ORed together. If any of the [.Detect.n] sections evaluates to TRUE, then the component is detected. If a component uses [.Detect.n] sections, it must not also have a [.Detect] section. The n in the [.Detect.n] sections is a numeric counter starting at 1. There should only be one [.Detect.1] section and one [.Detect.2] section for a given component across all INF files. The syntax for a detail line is the same as the syntax for the [.Detect] section: Type, Object Name, Attributes [SampleApp.Detect.1] File, %SampleAppPath%\SampleApp.exe, VERSION("ProductVersion","6.*") [SampleApp.Detect.2] File, %SampleAppPath%\SubApp.exe, VERSION("ProductVersion","* 3.*") [.Instructions] Section Required (see notes) Only one per component section Unique for given component across INF files The [.Instructions] section provides the INF rules used to migrate the state for the component. The standard INF commands are used in the [.Instructions] section (for more information, see "INF Commands"). Each command will list a section of registry objects or file objects that the command acts on. It is recommended that these section names begin with the component name they belong to. This is a convention, not a requirement, but it improves the maintenance and readability of the INF files. The [.Instructions] section is not executed if the component is not detected via the [.Detect] section or the [.Detect.n] sections. If the component does not have a [.Detect] section or any [.Detect.n] sections, it is assumed to be detected, and the [.Instructions] section is always executed (even if the component is not installed). The [.Instructions] section is required for a component, but not for an INF file. The syntax for a detail line is: INFCommand = Component.SectionName Parameters INFCommand  Any of the INF commands listed under "INF Commands" in this document. Component SectionName  Any valid INF section name. By convention the format of the name is Component.INFCommand. There must be a matching section in the INF file that contains the command details. [Acrobat Reader 40.Instructions] DestDelReg = Acrobat Reader 40.DestDelReg AddReg = Acrobat Reader 40.AddReg [Acrobat Reader 40.DestDelReg] HKR\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\4.0\AdobeViewer [AllowOpenFile] [Acrobat Reader 40.Addreg] HKR\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\4.0\AdobeViewer [AllowOpenFile] [Copy This State] Section Required (see notes) Only one per INF Combined across INFs The [Copy This State] section lists the INF commands used to migrate individual state. It is the equivalent to the [.Instructions] section, but for individual state instead of component state. The standard INF commands are used in the [Copy This State] section (for more information, see "INF Commands"). Each command will list a section of registry objects or file objects that the command acts on. The [Copy This State] section is always executed when in the INF file. The [Copy This State] section is required for individual state, but not for an INF file. The syntax for a detail line is: INFCommand = SectionName Parameters INFCommand  Any of the INF commands listed under "INF Commands" in this document. SectionName  Any valid INF section name. There must be a matching section in the INF file that contains the command details. The section names must be unique across all INF files. If not, they are combined with similarly named sections. [Copy This State] CopyFiles = SampleCopyFileSection [SampleCopyFileSection] DIR = C:\Data\* *.FSW, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% [Disabled Components] Section Optional (see notes) Only one per INF file Combined across INF files This section is not used in any of the shipping INF files. This section has only one main purpose: to disable the migration of Network Printers and Mapped Drives. The [Disabled Components] section lists the section names that must be  turned off  or not used. This section does override the [Copy This State] section, and the [.Instructions] section.  The syntax for a detail line is: SectionName Parameters SectionName  Any valid INF section name. There must be a matching section in the INF file that contains the command details. The section names must be unique across all INF files. If not, they are combined with similarly named sections. [Disabled Components] Net Printers and Drives [RemapEnvVar] Section Optional (see notes) Only one per INF file Combined across INF files This section is not used in any of the shipping INF files. This section has only one main purpose: to control the re-mapping and re-rooting of folders during migration. The [RemapEnvVar] section provides a way to indicate which environment variables must be considered for re-mapping and re-rooting during migration. Normally, only  known roots  like CSIDLs are used for this. By using the [RemapEnvVar] section and an environment variable, you can create new  known roots. The syntax for a detail line is: EnvironmentVariable Parameters EnvironmentVariable Any valid environment variable defined on both the source and destination system. It must not be enclosed in percent signs (%) as is normally done with environment variables. The [RemapEnvVar] sections are combined across all INF files used. [RemapEnvVar] CDATA This is an example of using [RemapEnvVar] with the two most common methods. [RemapEnvVar] CDATA MYSTUFF [Copy This State] CopyFiles = RemapExample [RemapExample] DIR = %CDATA%\* DIR = %MYSTUFF%\*, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% First, examine CDATA. On the source computer CDATA is defined as  C:\DataFiles . On the destination computer it is defined as  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\My Documents\Data . This section of the INF file copies all files and folders in  C:\DataFiles  on the source computer, and places them in  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\My Documents\Data , preserving the folder structure under  C:\DataFiles . For example,  C:\DataFiles\TrpRpt\Fabrikam.doc  becomes  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\My Documents\Data\TrpRpts\Fabrikam.doc MYSTUFF is an example of creating a larger known root used in path substitution. In the example above, MYSTUFF is defined as  C:\MyStuff  on the source computer, and as  C:\My Stuff  on the destination computer. Normally, with a rule like  DIR = C:\MyStuff, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  is the largest known root. So, if, on the source, there is  C:\MyStuff\TrpRpt\Fabrikam.doc , it becomes  C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\My Documents\MyStuff\TrpRpt\Fabrikam.doc . By using the [RemapEnvVar] section,  C:\MyStuff  becomes the largest known root, resulting in  C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\My Documents\TrpRpt\Fabrikam.doc. [Strings] Section Optional Only one per INF file Combines across INF files The [Strings] section defines the string variables used in the INF file. The [Strings] section is combined across all INF files used, so each string variable must be unique across INF files. The syntax for a detail line is: StringVariable =  String Value Parameters StringVariable A variable name unique across all used INF files. It must also be unique from [.Environment] variables and system environment variables. It must begin with a letter. String Value The value for the variable. [Strings] acroread40 = "Adobe Acrobat Reader" Types, Object Names, and Attributes Type can be any of the following: Description Directory Refers to any folder (local or on the network). Refers to any file (local or on the network). INIFile Refers to a value in a specified INI file. Registry Refers to a registry tree, key, or value. System Refers to the operating system. Object Name is specific to the Type as follows: Meaning of Object Name Directory A standard UNC or DOS path  Prototype: <Drive>:\Folder \\ServerName\Share\Folder Example: Directory, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\TripRpts The full path and file name of a file. Prototype: <Drive>:\Folder\Filename.ext \\ServerName\Share\Folder\Filename.ext Example: File, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\TripRpts\Fabrikam.doc INIFile registry  value stored in an INIFile Prototype: <Drive>:\Folder\sample.ini/section/key \\ServerName\Share\Folder\sample.ini/section/key Example: IniFile, %WINDIR%\myapp.ini/Settings/DataFolder Registry A registry tree, key, or value Prototype: RegistryRoot\RegistryKey [SettingName] Example: Registry, HKR\Software\MyApp\UserInfo [UserID]  Open and closed square brackets ([]) denote the (Default) value. System Version of operating system Prototype: OS.Version Name OS.Version Name can be any of the following: OS.Version Name for a Single OS Version Meaning 9X.Windows 95.Gold Windows 95 Gold 9X.Windows 95   OSR2.Gold Windows 95 OSR2 9X.Windows 98.Gold Windows 98 Gold 9X.Windows 98.Second Edition Windows 98 Second Edition 9X.Windows Millennium.Gold Windows Millennium Gold NT.Windows NT4.Gold Windows NT 4 Gold NT.Windows 2000.Gold Windows 2000 Gold NT.Windows 2000.XP Windows XP OS.Version Name for OS Family Groupings Meaning 9X.Windows 95 Windows 95 Gold and OSR2 9X.Windows 98 Windows 98 Gold and Second Edition All versions of Windows 95/98/Millennium NT.Windows 2000 Windows 2000 and Windows XP All versions of Windows NT/2000/XP Object Name can include system environment variables, CSIDLs, [Component.Environment] variables, and string variables. Attribute can be one of the following for any Type (except as noted below): Attribute Value Exists Evaluates to TRUE if Object Name exists. Applies to: Registry, Directory, System, File, INIFile SameObjectName(ObjName) Evaluates to TRUE if ObjName extends out to be equal to Object Name. Applies to: Registry, Directory, File, INIFile SameObjectContent(ObjName) Evaluates to TRUE if the content of ObjName equals the content of Object Name. Applies to: Registry, INIFile Matches(Value) Evaluates to TRUE if value equals the content of Object Name. Applies to: Registry, INIFile Version(Field, Pattern) Evaluates to TRUE if the version number of the FILE object to which Object Name points matches the version specified. Field indicates the name of the field that contains the version information. Pattern indicates the string pattern to match. Wildcards can be used in Pattern. Applies to: File, Registry If it is a Registry object, its value must point to a file. INF Commands Overview These are the INF commands used to indicate what state to migrate and how. With these commands you can migrate files, folders, registry trees, keys, and values. During migration these items can be renamed or moved to a new location. These are the core commands of the migration INF files. INF commands are used in [Copy This State] and [Component.Instructions] sections. The syntax for a detail line is: INFCommand = UniqueSectionName Parameters INFCommand  Any one of the INF commands listed below. UniqueSectionName  The section name with the details for the INF command. It must be unique across all INF files. If it is part of the component, it must follow the naming convention Component.INFCommand, although it is not required. The information about what the INF command specifically acts on is contained in the details section for that INF command. A single INF command can have multiple defined detail sections (one per line). [Copy This State] CopyFiles = SampleCopyFileSection CopyFiles = InHouseFileTypes [SampleCopyFileSection] DIR = C:\Data\* [InHouseFileTypes] *.nat *.ell File Commands File commands handle migrating folders, file types, and individual files. Migrated shortcuts to files which are relocated during migration are corrected to point to the new file location. By default, all local drives are scanned, but rules can be drive-specific, or even folder-specific. It is recommended that you change partitions between the source computer and destination computer. Wildcards Wildcards are supported where * is any number of characters (including 0) and ? is any single character. (The wildcards follow the general usage rules of MS-DOS.) Dealing With Folders When a detail section is referring to a folder, the line needs to start with DIR =. File Collision If a file is migrated to the destination and another file already exists on that destination, they collide. If the files are the same, the source file is discarded (because the destination is the same). If the files are not the same, and neither of the special file rules, ForceDestFile or ForceSrcFile, are used, then the file is renamed, appending an   at the end, where n is a numeric counter starting with 1. Usage Of Variables System environment variables, [Component.Environment] variables, string variables, and CSIDLs are supported in the detail lines of INF commands. See  Recognized INF Variables  for details on variables automatically supported by USMT. Some examples: [Copy This State] CopyFiles = SampleCopyFileSection [SampleCopyFileSection] DIR = C:\Data\* DIR = C:\Reports DIR = ?:\Stuff\* *.FSW, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% C:\Data\*.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% C:\Data\*\*.xls, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% In the above example, the line  DIR = C:\Data\*  refers to the folder C:\Data and all its subfolders. So, both the folders and all files in those folders will be migrated. The line  DIR = C:\Reports  includes the folder C:\Reports and all files in it, but not the subfolders in C:\Reports. The line  DIR = ?:\Stuff\*  includes the folder \Stuff on the root of any local non-removable drive. For example, if there is a C:\Stuff and a D:\Stuff, both are migrated. The line  *.FSW, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  refers to any file matching the pattern. The line  C:\Data\*.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  refers to all files matching the *.DOC pattern in the C:\Data folder. The line  C:\Data\*\*.xls, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  refers to all files matching the *.XLS pattern in the C:\Data folder or any of its subfolders. CopyFiles CopyFiles includes files or folders in the list of items to migrate. CopyFiles can also have the file or folder re-rooted during migration. Any known portions of the path will automatically be converted. For example, migrating C:\My Documents\reports\sample.doc from a Windows 98 system, the  C:\My Documents  portion is known as %CSIDL_PERSONAL% (My Documents). This would automatically be converted on the Windows XP system to the new My Documents folder, C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents. So the final file location would be: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Reports\sample.doc. The syntax for a detail line about files is: Path\Filename.ext, NewRootPath Parameters Path\Filename.ext The file pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLS. It does not require a full path to be given. UNC paths are supported. Examples *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% %CSIDL_PROGRAMFILES%\*\*.xls, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\SprdShts mymoney.mny NewRootPath Optional: If used, the file(s) are re-rooted to the new path given. For a managed environment you want to move all of a user intellectual property  files into their profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). The syntax for a detail line about folders is: DIR = Path, NewRootPath Parameters The folder pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. UNC paths are supported. Examples DIR = %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\* DIR = ?:\Data\* DIR = C:\Reports, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% NewRootPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are re-rooted to the new path given. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into their profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. CopyFilesEx CopyFilesEx is similar to CopyFiles with one exception. CopyFilesEx does not re-root files and folders when a NewRootPath is given. Instead, the files and folders are simply moved directly to that path. For example: Given the CopyFilesEx details of: *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% and a file on a Windows 98 source of: C:\My Documents\reports\sample.doc the final file location would be: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample.doc. Notice that the  reports  subfolder is not preserved. This works similarly for migrating folders. The folder is moved to the given destination, but the internal files and folder structure are preserved. For example: Give the CopyFilesEx details of: DIR=C:\Data, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% and a file and folder structure on the source of: C:\Data C:\Data\expenses.xls C:\Data\TripRpt\Fabrikam.doc The final file and folder structure would be: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Data C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Data\expenses.xls C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Data\TripRpt\Fabrikam.doc The syntax for a detail line about folders is: Path\Filename.ext, NewtPath Parameters Path\Filename.ext The file pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. It does not require a full path to be given. UNC paths are supported. Examples *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% %CSIDL_PROGRAMFILES%\*\*.xls, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\SprdShts NewPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are written to the new path given. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into their profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). The syntax for a detail line about folders is: DIR = Path, NewtPath Parameters The folder pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. UNC paths are supported. Example DIR = C:\Reports, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% NewRootPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are written to the new path given. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into the user profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. If the file or folder is not moved to a new location, then use CopyFiles instead of CopyFilesEx. DelFiles This does not actually delete any file and is safe to use. DelFiles excludes files from migration. A common use of this command is to exclude temporary files from folders included in the migration. For example, assuming %CSIDL_PERSONAL% is migrated (which it is by default), including a DelFiles rule to exclude %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\*\*.tmp would exclude all *.tmp files in the My Documents folder hierarchy from migration. The syntax for a detail line about folders is: Path\Filename.ext Parameters Path\Filename.ext The file pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. It does not require a full path to be given. UNC paths are supported. Examples *.tmp %CSIDL_PERSONAL%\*\*.tmp NewRootPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are re-rooted to the new path given. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into the user profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). The syntax for a detail line about folders is: DIR = Path Parameters The folder pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. UNC paths are supported. Example DIR = %CSIDL_INTERNET_CACHE%\* Normally, there are multiple detail lines. ForceSrcFile ForceSrcFile is a special command. By itself it does not affect whether a file or folder is migrated. It checks whether a file is migrated,and if there is already a file with the same name of the destination, it determines how to handle the name collision. When ForceSrcFile is used, the file from the source will overwrite the destination file. The syntax for a detail line about files is: Path\Filename.ext Parameters Path\FileName.ext The file pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. It does not require a full path to be given. UNC paths are supported. The syntax for a detail line about folders is: DIR = Path Parameters The folder pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. UNC paths are supported. Important Because this can lead to data loss on the destination (for example, if the destination file had valid data in it), it is recommended that you use this command only in extreme cases. Also, because this command is rarely used, most often there is only one detail line in the section, although it does support multiple lines. ForceDestFile ForceDestFile is a special command. By itself it does not affect whether a file or folder is migrated. It checks whether a file is migrated,and if there is already a file with the same name of the destination, it determines how to handle the name collision. When ForceDestFile is used, the file from the source will be discarded. It will not be given a new name as normally happens with file collision, nor will it overwrite the destination file. The syntax for a detail line about files is: Path\Filename.ext Parameters Path\Filename.ext The file pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. It does not require a full path to be given. UNC paths are supported. The syntax for a detail line about folders is: DIR = Path Parameters The folder pattern used for the rule. It can contain wildcards, system environment variables, component environment variables, or CSIDLs. UNC paths are supported. Important Because this can lead to data loss, it is recommended that you use this command only in extreme cases. Also, because it is rarely used, most often there is only one detail line in the section, although it does support multiple lines. Registry Commands Registry commands handle the migration of registry trees, keys, and values. They can also handle the migration of files, folders, or icons that a registry value points to. By default, all of HKey_Current_User is migrated by the command-line tools, except for the registry trees, keys, and values excluded. Using /x /s /f /u will cause only included registry trees, keys, and values to be migrated. Wildcards Wildcards are supported. * refers to any number of characters (including 0). ? is any single character. Registry Collision When a registry tree, key, or value is migrated, and it already exists on the destination, the registry items collide. If neither of the special commands ForceDestReg or ForceSrcReg are used, then the destination value is overwritten with the source value. Usage Of Variables System environment variables, [Component.Environment] variables, string variables, and CSIDLs are supported in the detail lines of INF commands. [Copy This State] AddReg = SampleAddRegSection [SampleAddRegSection] HKR\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings\* HKLM\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings [HighScore] HKR\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Profiles [] In the above example, the line  HKR\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings\*  says to migrate the registry tree starting with HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings. The line  HKLM\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings [HighScore]  says to migrate the specific value HighScore from the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Settings. The link  HKR\Software\MyCompany\MyApp\Profiles []  says to migrate the default value for the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyCompnay\MyApps\Profiles. AddReg AddReg includes registry trees, keys, or values in what is migrated. The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue] Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue Optional. This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. RenReg RenReg, like AddReg, adds a registry tree, key, or value to the list of objects to migrate, but it also provides a way to move that registry tree, key, or value to a new location. The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue] = NewRegPath Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue Optional: This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). NewRegPath Is the registry tree that includes items matching the left side pattern. The wildcard items are preserved, but the specifically called out items (aside from value) are replaced with the new path. Example HKLM\Software\MyApp\Profiles\* = HKR\Software\MyComp\MyApp\Profiles This will move all registry trees, keys, and values in the HKLM profiles tree to the HKR profiles tree preserving their internal structure. Sometimes there are multiple detail lines. DelReg DelReg excludes registry trees, keys, or values in what is migrated. The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue] Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue Optional. This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. RegFile RegFile is very similar to AddReg. It is used to include registry trees, keys, or values in what is migrated. The added feature of RegFile is that if the registry key points to a file, that file is also migrated. The normal automatic path repair is done (as explained in CopyFiles) on the file s path. Those changes are also reflected in registry value. Also, like CopyFiles, you can use RegFile to re-root a file (for more information, see "Re-rooting"). The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue] = NewRegPath, NewRootPath Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue  Optional. This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). NewRegPath Optional. Items that match the left side pattern are moved into this registry tree. The wildcard items are preserved, but the specifically called out items (aside from value) are replaced with the new path. Example HKLM\Software\MyApp\Profiles\* = HKR\Software\MyComp\MyApp\Profiles This will move all registry trees, keys, and values in the HKLM profiles tree to the HKR profiles tree, preserving their internal structure. NewRootPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are re-rooted to the new path given. For a managed environment you want to move all of a user intellectual property  files into the user profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. RegFolder RegFolder is very similar to RegFile, except that if the registry key points to a folder, the contents of the folder are also migrated. The normal automatic path repair is done (as explained in CopyFiles) on the file's path. Those changes are also reflected in registry value. Also, like CopyFiles, you can use RegFolder to re-root a file (for more information, see "Re-rooting"). The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue], NewRootPath Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue Optional. This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). NewRootPath Optional. If used, the file(s) are re-rooted to the new path given. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into their profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). Normally, there are multiple detail lines. RegIcon RegIcon is very similar to AddReg. It is used to include registry trees, keys, or values in what is migrated. The added feature of RegIcon is that if the registry key points to an icon, the icon is also migrated. The icon is extracted and added to a migrated icons file. The registry value is updated to reflect this change. The syntax for a detail line is: RegRoot\RegKey\RegSubKey [RegValue] Parameters RegRoot Can be either HKLM for HKey_Local_Machine or HKR for HKey_Current_User. RegKey\RegSubKey Any combination of registry keys and subkeys. RegValue Optional. This is a specific registry value in the given key. For the (Default) value of a key, use opening and closing square brackets ([]). ForceSrcReg This is the default behavior. ForceSrcReg does not affect anything if a registry tree, key, or value is migrated. If it is migrated and the same value exists on the destination computer, this INF command indicates that the destination computer must be overwritten with the source. This is the default behavior. ForceDestReg ForceDestReg does not affect anything if a registry tree, key, or value is migrated. If it is migrated and the same value exists on the destination computer, this INF command indicates that the value on the source computer must be discarded, and the destination computer must be left as it is. DestDelReg This is a dangerous command, and must be used with extreme caution. Important DestDelReg will delete the registry tree, key, or value specified from the destination computer before any other migration is done. This is a permanent deletion. The main reason for using this command is to enable the migration of default application settings, where the application stores the  default  settings by not having a registry value for them. If the tree on the destination is deleted first, then if the value did exist (with a non-default value set) the  default  will be migrated, because after the migration of the keys, it will be absent. Again, this is a dangerous INF command, and must be used only by advanced users and in extreme cases. It is recommended that you completely back up the operating system on which you test. INI Commands INI commands handle the migration of settings stored in INI files. They can also handle the migration of files, folders, or icons that a setting points to.  Wildcards Wildcards are supported. * refers to any number of characters (including 0). ? is any single character. Setting Collision When a setting is migrated, and it already exists on the destination, they collide. If neither of the special commands, ForceDestIni or ForceSrcIni, are used, then the destination setting is overwritten with the source setting. Usage Of Variables System environment variables, [Component.Environment] variables, string variables, and CSIDLs are supported in the detail lines of INF commands.  [Applications] TestApp, Test Application [TestApp.Environment] TestAppPath = Registry, HKLM\Software\TestApp [AppPath] [TestApp.Instructions] CopyFiles = TestApp.CopyFiles [TestApp.TestApp.CopyFiles] Dir=%TestAppPath%\Library\* Dir=%TestAppPath%\Playlist\* AddIni AddIni includes settings in an INI file in what is migrated. The syntax for a detail line is: INIFileName, Section, Setting Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to be migrated this can simply be a *. Normally, there are multiple detail lines. The IniFileName does not have to be the same for all lines in the section. RenIni RenIni, like AddIni, adds a setting to the list of objects to migrate, but it also provides a way to move that setting to a new location. The syntax for a detail line is: IniFileName, Section, Setting, DestIniFileName, DestSection, DestSetting Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to be migrated this can simply be a *. DestIniFileName This is the file name of the INI file the setting is migrated to. Wildcards are not supported. If this is left blank, IniFileName (the source filename) is used. A full path is not required, and if not supplied, the path of the source file is used (although mapped to the new system). DestSection This is the Section the migrated settings are written to. Wildcards are not supported. If this field is left blank, the original Section names are used. If this field is present, settings are written to the specified Section name regardless of their source Section name. DestSetting This is the Setting the migrated setting is written to. Wildcards are not supported. If the field is left blank, the original Setting names are used. If the field is present, settings migrated (via this command) are written to that setting name. When migrating multiple source settings with this RenIni line, leave this field blank. Example C:\Windows\System32\MyApp.ini, Win95 Settings, *,,Settings, This will move all settings in the C:\Windows\System32\MyApp.ini in the Win95 Settings section to the Settings section of a newly created C:\Windows\System32\MyApp.ini on the destination computer. Sometimes there are multiple detail lines. DelIni DelIni excludes settings from what is migrated. The syntax for a detail line is: INIFileName, Section, Setting Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to not migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to not migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to not be migrated this can simply be a *. Normally, there are multiple detail lines. IniFile IniFile is very similar to AddIni. It is used to include settings in what is migrated. The added feature of IniFile is if the setting points to a file, that file is also migrated. The normal automatic path repair is done (as explained in CopyFiles) on the file s path. Those changes are also reflected in registry value. Also, like CopyFiles, you can use IniFile to re-root a file (for more information, see "Re-rooting"). The syntax for a detail line is: IniFileName, Section, Setting, DestIniFileName, DestSection, DestSetting, NewRootPath, LocationHint Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to be migrated, this can simply be a *. DestIniFileName This is the file name of the INI file the setting is migrated to. Wildcards are not supported. If this is left blank, IniFileName (the source filename) is used. A full path is not required, and if not supplied, the path of the source file is used (although mapped to the new system). DestSection This is the Section the migrated settings are written to. Wildcards are not supported. If this field is left blank, the original Section names are used. If this field is present, settings are written to the specified Section name regardless of their source Section name. DestSetting This is the Setting the migrated setting is written to. Wildcards are not supported. If the field is left blank, the original Setting names are used. If the field is present, settings migrated (via this command) are written to that setting name. NewRootPath The file is re-rooted to this path. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into the user profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). LocationHint This is a semi-colon (;) separated list of paths used to find the object if the path provided is incomplete. For example: if you have an INI file containing  arial.ttf  and a LocationHint containing  c:\windows;c:\windows\system32;c:\windows\fonts , USMT will try to find arial.ttf by looking in each of those folders. When searching a path, it treats it as though it were part of the original path, so, for example, when using c:\windows, it would look for c:\windows\arial.ttf. Normally, there are multiple detail lines. See RegFile for a more complete description. IniFolder IniFolder is very similar to IniFile, except that if the setting points to a folder, the contents of the folder are also migrated. The normal automatic path repair is done (as explained in CopyFiles) on the file's path. Those changes are also reflected in the setting. Also, as with CopyFiles, you can use IniFolder to re-root a file (for more information, see "Re-rooting"). The syntax for a detail line is: IniFileName, Section, Setting, DestIniFileName, DestSection, DestSetting, NewRootPath, LocationHint Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to be migrated, this can simply be a *. DestIniFileName This is the file name of the INI file the setting is migrated to. Wildcards are not supported. If this is left blank, IniFileName (the source filename) is used. A full path is not required, and if not supplied, the path of the source file is used (although mapped to the new system). DestSection This is the Section the migrated settings are written to. Wildcards are not supported. If this field is left blank, the original Section names are used. If this field is present, settings are written to the specified Section name regardless of their source Section name. DestSetting This is the Setting the migrated setting is written to. Wildcards are not supported. If the field is left blank, the original Setting names are used. If the field is present, settings migrated (via this command) are written to that setting name.  NewRootPath The files are re-rooted to this path. For a managed environment, move all of a user intellectual property  files into the user profile, specifically to My Documents (%CSIDL_PERSONAL%). LocationHint This is a semi-colon (;) separated list of paths used to find the object, if the path provided is incomplete. For example: if you have INI file containing  arial.ttf  and a LocationHint containing  c:\windows;c:\windows\system32;c:\windows\fonts , USMT will try to find arial.ttf by looking in each of those folders. When searching a path, it treats it as though it were part of the original path, so, for example, when using c:\windows, it would look for c:\windows\arial.ttf. Normally, there are multiple detail lines. IniIcon IniIcon is very similar to AddIni. It is used to include settings in what is migrated. The added feature of IniIcon is that if the setting points to an icon, the icon is also migrated. The icon is extracted and added to a migrated icons file. The INI setting is updated to reflect this change. The syntax for a detail line is: IniFileName, Section, Setting, DestIniFileName, DestSection, DestSetting,, LocationHint Parameters IniFileName This is the file name of the INI file searched. Wildcards are not supported. Section This is the section the setting or settings to migrate are in. Wildcards are supported. Setting This is the specific setting, or settings, to migrate. Wildcards are supported. For example, when all settings in a specific section need to be migrated, this can simply be a *. DestIniFileName This is the file name of the INI file the setting is migrated to. Wildcards are not supported. If this is left blank, IniFileName (the source filename) is used. A full path is not required, and if not supplied, the path of the source file is used (although mapped to the new system). DestSection This is the Section the migrated settings are written to. Wildcards are not supported. If this field is left blank, the original Section names are used. If this field is present, settings are written to the specified Section name regardless of their source Section name. DestSetting This is the Setting the migrated setting is written to. Wildcards are not supported. If the field is left blank, the original Setting names are used. If the field is present, settings migrated (via this command) are written to that setting name.  Intentionally Empty Field There is an intentionally empty field between DestSetting and LocationHint. LocationHint This is a semi-colon (;) separated list of paths used to find the object, if the path provided is incomplete. For example: if you have an INI file containing  arial.ttf  and a LocationHint containing  c:\windows;c:\windows\system32;c:\windows\fonts , USMT will try to find arial.ttf by looking in each of those folders. When searching a path, it treats it as though it were part of the original path, so, for example, when using c:\windows, it would look for c:\windows\arial.ttf. ForceSrcIni This is the default behavior. ForceSrcIni does not affect anything if a setting is migrated. If it is migrated and the same value exists on the destination computer, this INF command indicates that the destination computer must be overwritten with the source. This is the default behavior. This syntax matches that of AddIni, and should be in terms of the source location. ForceDestIni ForceDestIni does not affect anything if a registry tree, key, or value is migrated. If it is migrated and the same value exists on the destination computer, this INF command indicates that the value on the source computer must be discarded, and the destination computer must be left as it is. This syntax matches that of AddIni, and should be in terms of the source location. Miscellaneous Commands ProcessSection This command tells the INF file to process another section as part of this section. It is an include command for INFs. A common example of its use is if there are two or more high-level components that use the state from the same sub-component (or another component). For example, use this command if the Modem Settings are migrated individually, as part of Dial-Up Networking settings or as part of Internet Browser settings. Instead of defining those settings three times, define them once as Modem Settings, and then include them in both Dial-Up Networking and Internet Browser by using a Process Section command, pointing to Modem Settings in each. Precedence The general rule for precedence is a simple one, the rule that most closely matches the circumstances of the object is the rule that is used. For example, a general CopyFiles rule like  *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  is less specific about C:\TripRpt\Fabrikam.doc than a rule like  DIR = C:\TripRpt\* . In this example, Fabrikam.doc would remain in the folder C:\TripRpt on the new computer, instead of being re-rooted to My Documents. However, if there is also a rule saying  C:\TripRpt\*.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL%  then it would also be migrated to My Documents. In the case where there are two rules that are equally specific about a file, the rule precedence order for registry rules is: RegFile RegFolder RegIcon RenReg AddReg DelReg The rule precedence order for file rules is: RegFile RegFolder SysFile.inf   EXCLUDE CopyFilesEx CopyFiles DelFiles If two similar rules refer to the same file but with different specifications, the outcome is based on the order in which the rules are encountered. For example, if there is one CopyFiles rule that says  *.doc  and another CopyFiles rule that says  *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% , the files either are moved or not moved to the My Documents folder as part of the migration, depending on the order in which the rules were encountered. In this case, all of the files handled by these rules would have the same outcome of either being moved or not being moved. The advice on rule precedence is: Keep it simple. t have conflicting rules. Test, test, test. Re-rooting A simple definition of re-rooting is to move the files to a new location, preserving the folder structure. More specifically, the largest known root in the source path is replaced with the new root path provided. Known roots include CSIDLs, system environment variables, and [Component.Environment] variables, plus the default root path (\). In most cases, the largest known path will be the root path of the drive, for example C:\. But sometimes a large root path is found and replaced. Examples CopyFiles rule details: *.doc, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% Source Files These are on a Windows 98 computer. C:\sample1.doc C:\Data\sample2.doc C:\Program Files\Sample Suite\SubApp\sample3.doc C:\My Documents\sample4.doc C:\My Documents\My Pictures\sample5.doc C:\Windows\sample6.doc C:\Windows\System32\sample7.doc Destination and Reasons for Change Sample 1: Largest found root is C:\. It is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample1.doc Sample 2: Largest found root is again C:\. It is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Data\sample2.doc Sample 3: Largest found root is now C:\Program Files, because it is %CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES%. It is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Sample Suite\SubApp\sample3.doc Sample 4: Largest found root is now C:\My Documents, because that is %CSIDL_PERSONAL%. That is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample4.doc In this case, %CSIDL_PERSONAL% evaluates differently on the source computer, a Windows 98 computer, and the destination computer, a Windows XP computer. This is why the final path is different from the source path, even though they had the same CSIDL root. Sample 5: Largest found root is now C:\My Documents\My Pictures, because that is %CSIDL_MYPICTURES%. This is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample5.doc Sample 6: Largest found root is now C:\Windows, because that is %CSIDL_WINDOWS%. This is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample6.doc Sample 7: Largest found root is now C:\Windows\System32, because that is %CSIDL_SYSTEM%. This is replaced with %CSIDL_PERSONAL% resulting in a final path of: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample7.doc Final Destination Files C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample1.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Data\sample2.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Sample Suite\SubApp\sample3.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample4.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample5.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample6.doc C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\sample7.doc Recognized INF Variables This is a comprehensive list of the variables recognized by the INF files. These variables do not have to be listed in the [RemapEnvVar] section. The INF files will also recognize any environment variables defined in the system, but determining the values of the variables listed here will always be attempted. Some of these variables cannot be determined due to operating system type and version dependencies. Please consult MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/) or Microsoft Visual Studio documentation for additional information concerning CSIDL identifiers.

The components in this file are: Accessibility Options Classic Desktop (pre-Luna look & feel) Display Properties Folder Options Fonts Internet Options Localization / International Settings Mouse and Keyboard ODBC Data Source Names Outlook Express Screen Saver Selection Sounds and Multimedia Taskbar These components are listed in the [System Settings] section in Migsys.inf. To disable the migration of any of these settings, insert a semicolon (;) before the line that lists the setting group you want to disable. This is an example of disabling the migration of Mouse and Keyboard. [System Settings] Accessibility, %accessibility% Fonts,, dir, %csidl_fonts% ;Mouse and Keyboard, %mouse_and_keyboard% Browser, %internet_settings% International, %International% Multimedia, %Multimedia% Outlook Express, %outlook_express% Display, %display% ScreenSaver, %screensaver% FolderOptions, %folderoptions% TaskBar, %taskbar% Classic, %classic% Notice the semicolon in front of the fourth line. This will cause USMT to ignore this line.  In order not to migrate any of these settings, do not include this INF on the command line. (For more information, see "Take All vs Take Known.") The INF rules for components (like Mouse and Keyboard) can modify the settings that are migrated. To comment out a line, add a semicolon in front of it. Miguser.inf Miguser.inf contains settings more specifically related to users. The components in this file are: Desktop  Favorites My Pictures My Documents Shared Desktop Shared Documents Shared Favorites Shared Start Menu Items Start Menu Items These components are listed in the [User Settings] section in Miguser.inf. To disable the migration of any of these settings, insert a semicolon (;) before the line that lists the setting group that you want to disable.

The INF rules for components (like Adobe Photoshop Suite 6) can modify the settings that are migrated. To comment out a line, add a semicolon in front of it. Sysfiles.inf This is a list of files that must not be migrated despite any other rules. These are operating system files that will conflict with the newer version of the files on Windows XP. SysFiles.INF file should not be modified. The only modification that you might want to make is to add more files to the list of files that never migrate under any circumstances. Migwiz.inf Migwiz.inf is the primary INF file for the FASTWiz GUI. It is discussed in detail later in this document. Migration.inf Migration.inf is created by Scanstate. It contains much of the state collected on the source computer. Migration.inf is stored in the destination location provided on the command line. Files and Settings Transfer Wizard INF and Migwiz.inf [CopyFiles] The list of files placed onto the wizard disc that FASTWiz creates. If you create a new INF for the GUI to use during the migration, the INF must be included in this list. Add the file name in a separate line. [OOBE] Reserved for future use. [Settings Only] The components transferred when the user selects Settings Only, regardless of transport. [Settings Only.Ext] The components transferred when the user selects Settings Only, and the transport is not floppy. [Files Only] The components transferred when the user selects Files Only, regardless of transport. [Files Only.Ext] The components transferred when the user selects Files Only, and the transport is not floppy. [Files And Settings] The components transferred when the user selects Files And Settings, regardless of transport. [Files And Settings.Ext] The components transferred when the user selects Files And Settings, and the transport is not floppy. [Screened Extensions] These are file types that the user does not transfer when the list of File Types to add is displayed. If the user manually adds the file type by using the edit box, the file type will be transferred (unless blocked by Sysfiles.inf). [EXT.IgnoreEXE] FASTWiz will automatically include most registered file types when the user selects Files Only or Files and Settings. If the type handler is one of these executables, then it is not included as a default type to transfer. [EXT.Exclude] Regardless of registration, these File Types are not added to the list of items to migrate by default. However, the user can still manually add them. If the File Types are also listed in Sysfiles.inf, they will not be migrated, regardless of what the user does. [EXT.Include] These file types are included in the default items to migrate, regardless of whether they are registered. The user can manually remove them. [AppsToInstallOnDest] Applications listed here need to be installed on the destination computer before the settings are applied. The user will be warned at the end of the scan to ensure that these applications are installed on the destination computer first. The user is also warned on the apply side that the applications must be installed before applying the settings. In most cases, if the application is installed later to the same location where it was installed on the former computer, it will still work. However, this behavior is not reliable. Migration.inf   The Command-Line State Store The Migration.inf is created by Scanstate and holds most of the migrating settings. In general, it must not be modified. It most often includes the sections listed below. For debugging issues, check what is stored in the Migration.inf to ensure that the state was scanned correctly. [Version] [Environment] [Object Types] [Data] [Registry] [File] [Cookies] [Printers] [RasConnection] [MappedDrives] Command-Line Parameters And Usage USMT consists of two command-line tools and the FASTWiz GUI tool. This section discusses the command-line parameters and usage of Scanstate.exe and Loadstate.exe. Scanstate.exe is used to collect the user s state (files and settings) from the former computer and installation. Loadstate.exe applies the user state collected by Scanstate.exe on the new computer and installation. These tools are located on the Windows XP CD in the ValueAdd\MSFT\USMT folder. Unicode or ANSI There are Unicode and ANSI versions of Scanstate.exe tools. The Unicode version is for scanning NT-based systems (Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP), and is located in ValueAdd\MSFT\USMT. The ANSI version is for scanning 9x-based systems (Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME), and is located in ValueAdd\MSFT\USMT\ANSI. Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later must be installed with either the Unicode or the ANSI version. Regardless of which version of Scanstate.exe is used, the Unicode version of Loadstate.exe in ValueAdd\MSFT\USMT must be used to apply the state. Take All vs. Take Known When performing a migration with USMT you can use one of two models, Take All or Take Known. These refer to the user s registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER). The recommended solution is to use the Take Known model. In the Take All model, HKEY_CURRENT_USER is migrated in its entirety, aside from rules in the INFs to exclude certain portions. Advantages Disadvantages Many settings for non-supported applications are also migrated successfully. More like the upgrade experience. Less controlled migration. Garbage in HKEY_CURRENT_USER is also migrated. Risk of some applications not working correctly due to invalid settings for the new environment. In the Take Known model, the only parts of HKEY_CURRENT_USER that are migrated are the ones indicated by the INFs. Advantages Disadvantages Controlled Migration. Highly unlikely to break anything. INFs must be customized to handle applications not supported by default. Suggested Command-Lines Remember:  Scanstate must be run by the user who is migrating. Loadstate must be run by a user with local administrator access who is not the user who is migrated. The user s profile must not exist on the destination computer before running Loadstate.exe. Take Known Model (Recommended) Scanning: Scanstate \\ServerName\Share\Folder /I miguser.inf /I migapp.inf /I migsys.inf /I sysfiles.inf /v 7 /x /s /f Applying: Loadstate \\ServerName\Share\Folder /v 7 Take All Model Scanning: Scanstate \\ServerName\Share\Folder /I miguser.inf /I migapp.inf /I migsys.inf /I sysfiles.inf /v 7 Applying: Loadstate \\ServerName\Share\Folder /v 7 Command-Line Parameters Scanstate Parameter Meaning Invokes Help. /i filename.inf Specifies an INF file containing rules that define what state to migrate. Multiple /i parameters can be used. /l logfile.txt Specifies a path and file name to save the log to. By default the log is saved in CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA\scanstate.log. /v <Verbosity> Specifies the level of detail used in the log. Use 0 (default) for least detail. Use 7 for most detail. Specifies that no settings or files be migrated by default. Specifies that settings listed in the INFs be migrated.  System  elements are also migrated. These are Network Printers, RAS Connections, and Cookies. Specifies that files listed in the INFs be migrated. Enables collection of the entire HKEY_CURRENT_USER by default. (Scanstate.exe should use the Take Known model.) Specifies to continue when encountering an error that can be ignored. (An error code is still returned.) Pre-Scan the system to determine how much storage space will be needed. It generates a space estimate file (USMTsize.txt) instead of an actual store. The file is a tab-delimited file with two columns. The first column is block size, and the second is how many bytes are required at that block size. The first line of the file is the numbers for the store location indicated on the command-line. /md <domain name> Provides an easy way to change the domain name during migration. If after the migration the user will be part of a different domain, this is an easy way to provide the domain the user should be created in. /mu <user name> Provides an easy way to change the user s logon name during migration. If after the migration the user will have a new logon name, this is an easy way to change it so the user is created with the correct logon name. If there is already a migration store at the indicated target location, the store is overwritten without warning. If /x, /f, /s, and /u are not used on the command-line, the default is /f /s /u. /x is ignored if /f /s /u are also used. Loadstate Parameter Meaning Invokes Help. /i filename.inf Specifies an INF file containing rules that define what state to migrate. Multiple /i parameters can be used. /l logfile.txt Specifies a path and file name to save the log to. By default the log is saved in CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA\scanstate.log. /v <Verbosity> Specifies the level of detail used in the log. Use 0 (default) for least detail. Use 7 for most detail. Specifies that no settings or files be migrated by default. Specifies that settings listed in the INFs be migrated. Specifies that files listed in the INFs be migrated. Enables collection of the entire HKEY_CURRENT_USER by default. (Scanstate.exe should use the Take Known model.) /md <domain name> Provides an easy way to change the domain name during migration. If after the migration the user will be part of a different domain, this is an easy way to provide the domain the user should be created in. /mu <user name> Provides an easy way to change the user s logon name during migration. If after the migration the user will have a new logon name, this is an easy way to change it so the user is created with the correct logon name. Loadstate migrated settings to the current user. The migrated user is not created, and administrator rights are not required.  WARNING: This will have slightly different results than running from administrator mode.  For example, security can prevent some settings or files from being restored. Also, the /md and /mu switches are ignored. If /x, /f, /s, and /u are not used on the command-line, the default is /f /s /u. /x is ignored if /f /s /u are also used. Return Codes and Logs Scanstate.exe and Loadstate.exe return 0 if successful. A value other than 0 means there was an error. The common Windows error codes are used. You can use a tool like Error Lookup (included with Visual Studio) to learn more details on specific error codes. USMT (command-line) logs are stored in %CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA% for the user running the tool. On a Windows XP system, this is usually C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data. The Scanstate.exe log file is scanstate.log. The Loadstate.exe log file is loadstate.log. These logs can be written to other folders and other file names by using the /l switch. FASTWiz logs are also stored in %CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA%. The FASTWiz log file is FASTWiz.log. The results displayed on the final page of FASTWiz are stored in FASTWiz.htm. Common Scenarios To Create An INF File Start Notepad (or your preferred text editor). Create a [Version] section. Add the signature line. Create an empty [Applications] section. Create an empty [Copy This State] section. Create an empty [Strings] section. Save the file using an INF extension. To Add A Component List the component in an [Applications] section. Optional: Create a [.Environment] section. Optional: Create a [.Detect] section to detect if the application is installed. Optional: Create [.Detect.n] sections instead. Create a [.Instructions] section listing the rules to do the migration. Create a section for each section referenced in the [.Instructions] section listing the objects to migrate. To Add Individual State Add an INF command to the [Copy This State] section. Create a section for the section named with the INF command in the [Copy This State] section listing the objects to migrate. Summary This document explains the INF files for the User State Migration Tools (USMT), Files and Settings Transfer Wizard (FASTWiz), and the INF commands. It also explains how to perform basic modifications to these files and how to create your own INF files to use with the migration tools. Information Technology (IT) professionals and consultants who customize USMT for Windows XP deployments are the primary audience of this document. The reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of scripting, although no real programming knowledge is required. It is recommended that the reader also be familiar with using a text editor, such as Notepad or Microsoft  Visual Studio For large-scale automated migrations with the User State Migration Tool, IT professionals can refer to User State Migration in Windows XP at, http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/techinfo/howitworks/userstate.

This test harness helps in testing the compliance
matrix without creating the actual media.

It parses a text file which specifies the matrix
in sections. 

Each section name starts with '[' and ']'. The '#' 
character is used as string separator.

Some well known sections are [type#values], [var#values],
[suite#values] and [error#vaules] etc. These sections 
define keys which can be used in the actual testcase.
For e.g. [type#values] defines "pro=0x40" which indicates
that product type professional's internal representation
using DWORD is 0x40.

The value sections need to be at the start of the
test matrix text file. The other kind of sections 
which can be present in this test case matrix file are
called "Test Sections". These sections contain the actual
test cases.

For e.g.

[test#pro#5.0#2031#none#retail#fpp]
win3x#3.1#950#none#any=typeerr,no
win9x#9.5#950#none#any=none,yes
ntw#3.1#1057#none#any=vererr,no


indicates that the sections is for testing professional, 
version 5.0, build 2031, with not product suites and is
of type FPP retail variation. Each line in this section 
indicates the target platform for which this media needs
to be tested for upgrade. 

For e.g.

win9x#9.5#950#none#any=none,yes

Indicates that Windows 9X, version 9.5 and build number 950
with no product suites and of type any variation needs to
pass on upgrade with this professional media. 

Another e.g.

ntw#3.1#1057#none#any=vererr,no

Indicates that NT workstation version 3.1, build number 1057,
with no product suites and of type any variation, needs to
fail on upgrade with version error with the given professional
media.

Instructions to build the hives:

The hives are now checked in and are only built on an as needed bases. This was
done to eliminate one of the requirements that users must be admin to build the
system.  In order to make a change to setupreg.ini, setupp.ini, or the hive building 
scripts (mkhive*.cmd), you need to check out the hives, and update them after you 
are done building. Ideally - the new hive files should be checked in with the same 
change number as the ini changes so it's easy to understand what the diffs are.

Again, building hives requires admin access.  If you're not an admin on your machine,
do so now - signin as Administrator, open a cmd window, and run:

Net Localgroup Administrators /add <your domain/username>

When you're done, come back to this directory and run the mkit.cmd script.

It will build the hives, checkout the necessary files under the bin dir, and
copy the new hives over. Is up to you to actually run a build and make sure
the new hives are valid. When you're satisfied, submit all the checked out files
under the bin directory (not just setupreg.*).

Oh, and there's no requirement that you be running x86 in order to build the
hives - the files themselves are generic (the initial versions were built
on an ia64 machine).

Any questions/problems/etc - see bryant

Author: Sandy Coyne
Date: March 7, 2000


Given two files as input, ESCPEINF.EXE generates one output file.

Usage: escpeinf U|C <input file> <output file> <layout.inf>
        U = Upgrade
        C = Clean Install
All fields are required.

The input file must be an inf file containing a [File Security] section. If it does not contain that section, the output file should be identical to the input.

All comparisons are case insensitive. All quotes are required where shown.

Any line that does not fit the following format should be copied to the output file unchanged.

Recognized Input Lines, only in the [File Security] section:

	"<directory>\<WildCardName>",<Integer>,"<SecurityDescriptorString>"

After a line containing a wildcard, there may be zero or more exception lines:

	Exception="<ExceptionFileName>"


Input Detail:
<directory> must be one of the directories in the layout.inf [WinntDirectories] section, and it must begin with "%SystemRoot%" or "%SystemDirectory%"   An example is "%SystemRoot%\Help"

<WildCardName> must be a filename containing at least one wildcard.   An example is "*.hlp"

<Integer> must be a natural integer. Since ESCAPE only accepts a few low numbers, it is possible that huge integers will break the tool. This is okay.   An example is "2"

<SecurityDescriptorString> is a properly formatted security descriptor string. One important aspect of this formatting is that it cannot contain any whitespace.  An example is "D:P(A;;GRGX;;;BU)(A;;GRGX;;;PU)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;SY)"

<ExceptionFileName> is a file name, with no path. If desired, it can contain wildcards.   Examples are "win.ini" or "*.hlp"

Output:
The Recognized Input Lines will not appear in the output. In their place will be lines in this format:
	"<directory>\<filename1>",<Integer>,"<SecurityDescriptorString>"
	"<directory>\<filename2>",<Integer>,"<SecurityDescriptorString>"
	"<directory>\<filename3>",<Integer>,"<SecurityDescriptorString>"
			.
			.
			.

Output Detail:
<directory> will be identical to the <directory> field of the input.

<filenameX> will be a filename that is found in the layout.inf that matches the <WildCardName> field of the input and is destined for <directory>, except if the filename matches the <ExceptionFileName> field, or if the file is never installed in this mode (Upgrade or Clean Install).

<Integer> will be identical to the <Integer> field of the input.

<SecurityDescriptorString> will be identical to the <SecurityDescriptorString> field of the input.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Corp. Program Description Title _PID_GUIDProgram Description Dapeng Zhu Normal Dapeng Zhu Microsoft Word 8.0Program Description This program checks against INF files that are used by an optional component.  During the test of Optional Component Manager, many document bugs were found.  The main purpose of the program is to check for such bugs in the INF file. Program Usage The program gets its input from the command line.  The input is either a master INF file or a component s INF file for use with Optional Component Manager. If it is a master INF file, the program checks all the INF files that it points to in the [Components] section.  If the input is a single component s INF file, certain errors are not checked since information may be incomplete.  Command line switches can t be viewed by typing checkinf without any argument. Program Structure The program is written in C++.  Various classes are used to represent optional component and their relations.  The class definitions can be found in component.h.  All the member functions that are not inline are implemented in component.cpp.  Checkinf.cpp is the main program that utilizes the classes to for errors in the INF files. Source code location %_NTDRIVE%\nt\private\windows\setup\ocmanage\testoc\checkinf Errors checked The program builds a link list of all the components.  It checks for the validity of Inf files during the process.  E.g. there should be at least one component listed in the [Components] section; there should be at least two fields in a "Needs =" line, etc. The program checks the validity of the IconIndex key.  It should have at least two fields.  If the second field is a number, its value should be between 0 and 66. (There are three bad numbers that will confuse the user).  If it is not a number, it should be a "*" The program checks the need relationship among the components.   A component that has children can't need a another component A component can't need a component with children There should not be any cycle, e.g. a needs b, b needs a Need and Exclude relationship should not exist at the same time between two components A component can t need a non-existent component if a master INF file is given. The program checks the exclude relationship among the components. A component that has children can t need another component A component can t need a component with children A component can t exclude a non-existent component Component that has children should not have Copyfiles section.  In fact, it will give out a warning if there is any suspicious section for such a component. The program checks if there are two components with same IDs. The program checks for components with same description The number in "Modes" line should be valid (0-3) Each component INF file must have a LayoutFile = Layout.inf line No Component INF file should have [SourceDisksNames] and [SourceDisksFiles] section. Sample Output The output was generated by the running the program on the optional components that come with 1859 fre.wks sysoc.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\netoc.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\rsoptwks.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\iis.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\mtsnt5.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\setupqry.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\msmqocm.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\ims.inf opened H:\work\checkinf\i386\imagevue.inf opened IconIndex not present for component msmq mts_core needs mdac, which is not in the list LayoutFile not found in file rsoptwks.inf LayoutFile not found in file iis.inf LayoutFile not found in file setupqry.inf LayoutFile not found in file msmqocm.inf LayoutFile not found in file ims.inf

VOID CheckAllocs() Call this function at the very end of the test, just before the test exits. This function will verify that all memory has been freed. If any memory is left unfreed, the function will create a MessageBox pointing to the malloc locations of the memory that is unfreed, and the program will exit abnormally. BOOL _Malloc(void **ppv, size_t size) Use this routine anytime you wish to allocate memory. The routine will allocate the memory, shred the contents of the memory, and keep a record of this memory allocation. The function will return TRUE if the memory allocation succeeded, and FALSE if the memory allocation failed. The interface to this function is different from that of the standard malloc function. Following is an example of how to call this function: PSAMPLE_STRUCT pSampleStruct; BOOL bResult; Old Malloc: pSampleStruct = (PSAMPLE_STRUCT)malloc(sizeof(SAMPLE_STRUCT)); New Malloc: bResult = Malloc(&pSampleStruct, sizeof(SAMPLE_STRUCT)); VOID _Free(void **ppv) Use this routine anytime you wish to free previously allocated memory. The routine will check to make sure that ppv points to memory that was actually allocated, free the memory, and set the value of ppv to NULL. Example of how to call the function: Old Free: free(pSampleStruct); New Free: _Free(&pSampleStruct); Other Routines: VOID _ASSERT(BOOL bExpression) This function will assert if bExpression is FALSE. If the function asserts, it will create a MessageBox containing the line number and file name of the _ASSERT call, and the program will exit abnormally. PTCHAR ErrorMsg(IN          ULONG  ulError,                      IN OUT PTCHAR tszBuffer) Converts a standard windows error number (of the type returned by GetLastError()) into a word description of the error. If a word description of the error cannot be found, the number stored in ulError is converted into a string and this string is returned. ulError is the error number to convert. tszBuffer is a buffer in which to store the word description. This buffer will be returned from the function. PWCHAR AnsiToUnicode(IN      PCHAR     cszAnsi,                                             OUT  PWCHAR  wszUnicode,                                            IN      ULONG    ulSize) Converts an ANSI string to a UNICODE string, and returns the new Unicode string.  cszAnsi points to the ANSI string to convert.  wszUnicode points to a buffer large enough to store the new Unicode string. ulSize must be equal to the length of the wszUnicode string. PCHAR UnicodeToAnsi(IN     PWCHAR wszUnicode,                                        OUT  PCHAR    cszAnsi,                                        IN     ULONG    ulSize) Converts a Unicode string to an ANSI string, and returns the new ANSI string. wszUnicode points to the Unicode string to convert.  cszAnsi points to a buffer large enough to store the new ANSI string.  ulSize must be equal to the length of the cszAnsi string. PTCHAR ConvertAnsi(IN     PCHAR     cszAnsi,                                      OUT PWCHAR  wszUnicode,                                      IN    ULONG     ulSize) Receives an ANSI string, and returns the same string in either its ANSI or Unicode version, depending on whether the program was compiled as ANSI or Unicode.  cszAnsi points to the ANSI string to (possibly) convert.  wszUnicode points to a buffer large enough to hold the new Unicode string, if needed.  ulSize must be equal to the length of the wszUnicode string.   The function will either return cszAnsi or wszUnicode depending on whether the ANSI version or the Unicode version must be returned. PTCHAR ConvertUnicode(IN    PWCHAR  wszUnicode,                                            OUT PCHAR     cszAnsi,                                            IN    ULONG     ulSize) Receives a Unicode string, and returns the same string in either its ANSI or Unicode version, depending on whether the program was compiled as ANSI or Unicode.  wszUnicode points to the Unicode string to (possibly) convert.  cszAnsi points to a buffer large enough to hold the new ANSI string, if needed. ulSize must be equal to the length of the cszAnsi string.  The function will either return cszAnsi or wszUnicode depending on whether the ANSI version or the Unicode version must be returned.                                             LogUtils.c Logging Routines: HANDLE InitLog(IN PTCHAR tszLogName,                              IN PTCHAR tszTitle,                             IN BOOL      bConsole) Initializes a log. If ntlog.dll is present on the system, the log will be in ntlog format. If not, the log will be in a format that resembles ntlog.  tszLogName specifies the name of the log, such as  program.log tszTitle specifies the title of the console window in which the log output will be displayed. bConsole specifies whether or not a console window must be created. If the program is a windows program, a console should probably be created. If the program is a console program, a console might not need to be created. VOID ExitLog() Closes the log file. VOID Log(IN double       dFunctionNumber,                   IN DWORD   dwLogLevel,                   IN PTCHAR  tszLogString,                   IN  Prints out a line of output to the log. This function will automatically format the log output so that it will not run past the end of the line. If the string is longer than one log line, the string will be broken up into multiple log outputs, each printed on a new line. This gives the appearance of word wrap formatting. If the log is being run without ntlog.dll installed, TLS_INFO log lines will be printed to the console in gray, PASS lines will be printed in green, and SEV lines will be printed in red. dFunctionNumber can be any number. This is used to record where in the program the log line originated. One possible format is to give each function its own function number, so that every log line in that function would begin with that unique number.  dwLogLevel may be either TLS_INFO, TLS_SEV2, TLS_PASS, etc. Or you may use the shorter versions, INFO, SEV2, and PASS. tszLogString is a printf style string that will be printed to the log.  is the arguments to the tszLogString, if any. VOID LogBlankLine() Prints a blank line to the log. VOID AddLogParticipant(IN HANDLE hLog) Adds a new thread or process to the log. This is only necessary if the log is using ntlog.dll. hLog must be equal to the value returned from the InitLog function. VOID RemoveLogParticipant(IN HANDLE hLog) Removes a thread or process from the log. This is only necessary if the log is using ntlog.dll. hLog must be equal to the value returned from the InitLog function }xsni

This document describes the functionality tested in each of the various 
OC Manager test scenario groups.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 1' tests the following:

-- Skip Pages

The welcome page contains a checkbox that will enable the user to skip page 2. 
If the checkbox is left unchecked, page 2 will appear as normal. If the 
checkbox is checked, page 2 should be skipped when the user clicks the 'Next' 
and 'Back' buttons.


-- Change Mode

The modes page will allow the user to change the installation mode between 
the four mode choices: Minimal, Typical, Laptop, and Custom. The user may 
change the mode and click the 'Next' or 'Back' buttons. The new mode should 
be reflected on the new wizard page.


-- If all children are disabled, parent should be disabled

On the components selection page, unselect all children of a component and 
hit ok. The component should now be unselected.


-- If some but not all children are enabled, parent should be enabled but greyed

On the components selection page, select some children of a component and 
unselect others. Verify that the component is checked but the checkbox is 
greyed out. Change the selection configuration of the component's children. 
Leave only one child selected, etc., and verify that the component's checkbox 
is checked and greyed accordingly.


-- Force OC Manager to prompt for files

Run the test so that the copy files are not in the current directory or 
any system path directory. When OC Manager prepares to copy the files, 
it should prompt for the location of the files. Attempt to answer with 
invalid locations. Finally, direct OC Manager to the correct location. 
The files should be copied. This may also be attempted with the files 
scattered across multiple directories.


-- Check component dependencies

Some subcomponents depend upon other subcomponents. If one subcomponent is 
not selected, another subcomponent may not be selected without also 
selecting the first. If the first subcomponent is deselected, both 
subcomponents must be deselected. The following procedure will test this:

- Select master Unicode component so that it is checked and not greyed.

- Verify that Unicode component_2_1_1 is checked and not greyed

- Uncheck Unicode component_2_1_1 and verify that Unicode_2_1_2 also 
  becomes unselected.

- Select Unicode component_2_1_2 and verify that Unicode component_2_1_1 
  also becomes selected.

- Unselect Unicode component_2_1_2 and verify that Unicode component_2_1_1 
  is not affected.

- Click OK and verify that Unicode component_2_1 is greyed.

- If Unicode component_2_2 is checked, uncheck it.

- Verify that ANSI component_2 is not checked.

- Check ANSi component_2 and verify that Unicode component_2_2 is now checked.

- Uncheck ANSI component_2 and Unicode component_2_2.

- Verify that ANSI component_1 is not checked.

- Check ANSI component_1 and verify that ANSI component_2 and Unicode 
  component_2_2 are now checked.


-- If a component has multiple children and one or some of them refuse to 
   be selected, but others can be selected, verify that the component may 
   be selected.

- Select master ANSI component so that it is checked and not greyed. 

- Unselect all ANSI components.

- Select ANSI component_2.

- Select ANSI component_1_1.

- Select ANSI component_1_2.

- Verify that ANSI component_1 is checked but greyed.

- Verify that the master ANSI component is checked but greyed.


-- Verify that needs dependencies and components that refuse to be 
   selected work together.

- Make sure that ANSI component_1 and ANSI component_2 are both unchecked.

- Check ANSI component_1_1 and click OK.

- Verify that ANSI component_1 is checked and greyed.

- Verify that ANSI component_2 is now checked.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 2' tests the following:

-- Nonexistent component INF

The oc2.inf file points to component INF files that do not exist. 
The OC Manager should respond with an error message. If the test is
running from the command line, it should exit. If the test is running
during system setup, this compoment should be skipped but setup should
continue.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 3' tests the following:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 4' tests the following:

-- Nonexistent components in PageAdd and PageReplace sections

The oc4.inf lists nonexistent components in the PageAdd and PageReplace
sections. OC Manager should pop up windows complaining about these 
invalid components, but it should continue to install the valid
component, unicomp.

Unicomp.inf also contains links to these nonexistent components and 
their nonexistent subcompoments.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 5' tests the following:

-- Multiple compoments in same compoment INF file

There are two components, unicomp and ansicomp. Both share the same INF
file, comp.inf. This is not standard procedure. Each component is supposed
to have its own INF file. However, this procedure works in most instances,
although not in every way. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'octest 6' tests the following:

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntsetup\oobe\inc\changes.txt ===
This file details changes made to files in this directory to port the code from
the Win9x tree to the Whistler tree.

* Added setupx32.h from Millenium setup project for msobmain\auditmd.cpp.
* Add Bool2VarBool inline function to util.h.  Maps BOOL values to VARIANT_BOOL
  values appropriately: zero values remain zero, non-zero values become -1.
* Changed MSOBMAIN_ENRTY to MSOBMAIN_ENTRY.
* changed _DEBUG to DBG.
* Added ValidateEula stub to map eula validation to setupx.dll (Win9x) or
  syssetup.dll (Winnt)
  * added msobstub.h to depot for exported function declarations, typedefs, etc.
  * msobstub.h: added ValidateEula declaration
* util.h: added prototype for PumpMessageQueue( )
* appdefs.h: defined WM_OBCOMM_DIAL_DONE
* util.h: added prototype for IsThreadActive( )
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntsetup\oobe\idl\changes.txt ===
This file details changes made to files in this directory to port the code from
the Win9x tree to the Whistler tree.

* Added sources file and standard NT makefile.  
* Removed idl.mk and Win9x makefile. 
* Removed include <basetsd.h> from obcomm.idl.  It is included via
  unknwn.idl.
* obcomm.idl
    * Added OnDialEvent method to IObCommunicationManager
=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntsetup\oobe\msobcomm\changes.txt ===
This file details changes made to files in this directory to port the code from
the Win9x tree to the Whistler tree.

* Added sources file and standard NT makefile.  
* Removed msobcomm.mk and Win9x makefile. 
* Changed condition of #if in rnaapi.cpp\RasGetEntryProperties from WINVER !=
  0x400 to WINVER < 0x400.  This is potentially dangerous because the code was
  hand tuned to windows ver 4.  In fact, ChrisK said that there is a security
  hole here somewhere that was not fixed because the cost was higher than the
  risk.
* Removed definition of RASAUTODIALENTRY from inshdlr.h.  It is defined in
  ras.h.
* Removed definition for RASDT_Atm obcomglb.h.  Already defined in ras.h.
* Moved msobcomm.rc and resources.h from messages\usa to root.  Removed all
  references to messages\usa.
* Moved version info from msobcomm.rcv to msobcomm.rc.
* Removed msobcomm.rcv and msobcomm.aps.
* Included tchar.h in obcomglb.h for TCHAR and related macros.
* Removed include <netmpr.h> from ienews.cpp.  Not needed in NT build.
* Changed return value of Sz2W from int to WORD since that is what it is really
  returning.
* Changed parameter of GetSz from WORD to DWORD.  This was causing a data
  conversion error when GetSz was called with a resource ID.
* Cast return value from Sz2W in StrToSubip to BYTE to resolve data conversion
  error.
* Mapped symbols in DEF file exports table to actual symbol names in
  obcommon.lib to resolve unresolved externals.
* Commented out DESCRIPTION in msobcomm.def to resolve LNK4017 (DESCRIPTION
  statement not supported for the target platform; ignored)
* Included shellapi.h for ShellExecute
* changed _DEBUG to DBG.
* Fixed invalid handle exception during shutdown.
    * refdial.cpp: initialized m_hDialThread to NULL in constructor.
* import.cpp: CISPImport::ImportConnection
    * call to Rnaapi.InetConfigClientEx now takes szDefPhoneBook as second
      parameter instead of NULL.  
        * NT: szDefPhoneBook points to an null-terminated
          string containing the fully qualified path to the default phone.  
        * Win9x: szDefPhoneBook is NULL.
* misc.cpp
    * include shlobj.h, assert.h
    * added GetCommonAppDataDirectory( ): wrapper around 
      SHGetFolderPath(CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA)
    * added GetDefaultPhoneBook( ): returns fully qualified path to rasphone.pbk
* obcomglb.h
    * added prototypes for
        * GetCommonAppDataDirectory
        * GetDefaultPhoneBook
* sources
    * added shfolder.lib to TARGETLIBS for SHGetFolderPath
* refdial.cpp
    * CRefDial::CRefDial: initialized BSTRs.  Fixed AV due to freeing
      uninitialized memory.
    * CRefDial::~CRefDial: wait for threads to finish before exiting
      destructor.  Fixed AV due to closing invalid thread handle.
* msobcomm.cpp, msobcomm.h, refdial.cpp, refdial.h
    Added OnDialEvent method.  This creates a way to notify the communication
    manager of dialing thread state: particularly that the thread is exiting.
    This fixes an AV that occurred because CRefDial was trying to close the
    handle of a non-existent thread (m_hDialThread) in the destructor.
* refdial.cpp, msobcomm.cpp, import.cpp,rnaapi.cpp
    * changed _NT_ to WINNT

A WALK THROUGH FORMAT
			---------------------
			  Ver.5.00.410Beta
			  ----------------

	Upon entry to Format, the routine Main_Init is called.  This 
performs all the parsing of the command line, and determines the 
default value for DeviceParameters, which represents the highest 
capacity format for the disk drive being used.  Upon return, a copy of 
SwitchMap (a word value which holds all the switches entered on the 
command line) is saved in SwitchCopy.

	The memory block allocated to the Format code is then resized 
using Int 21h function 4Ah, so as to free extra un-needed memory 
allocated for the FORMAT.COM program when it was loaded.

	Module GLBLINIT is responsible for allocating all the buffers 
needed by Format.  These buffers are listed below.


Name			Size				Primary Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------		
DirectorySector		1 sector (512 bytes)	Holds a zeroed 
						sector to be written to 
						disk as the root dir.

FatSpace		FAT+RootDir+		Holds new FAT.  
			7 sectors		Reserves space for 
						buffers needed by 						
						Mirror.

FatSector		1 sector		Read in old FAT 
						one sector at a time.

DirBuf			1 sector		General-purpose use e.g.
						reading in boot sector,
      		 				first sector of root dir.

ClustBound_Buffer_Seg 	1 cluster		Read in bad clusters
						on fixed disks.

mStart			Biggest block of 	Read in system files,
						if needed.


	A buffer for system files will be allocated only if /S is specified.  
If this is present, system files will be read in at this time.  The system 
files are read in now so as to prevent an extra disk swap later, i.e. it is 
assumed that the system disk will be in the default drive at this point.  
In case the buffer was not big enough for all the system files (IO.SYS, 
MSDOS.SYS, COMMAND.COM), they will be read in as much as 
possible.  The remainder will then be read in when the system files 
are being written out to disk, after completion of formatting (This idea
is now prevented: if the files cannot be all read prior to format, format
will fail).

	The 1-cluster buffer will be allocated only if the drive being 
formatted is a fixed disk.

	This module also determines the default value for 
DeviceParameters (by a call to routine GetDeviceParameters, which 
obtains them through Int 21h function 440Dh, subfunction 60h).  These 
default parameters are copied to SavedParams.

	A failure of any function call in GLBLINIT will result in the 
termination of Format.

	The portion after the call to Global_Init is the main loop of the 
program.  The code between 'SysLoop' and 'call More' is repeated for 
each disk to be formatted.

	The routine InitSysParm restores the state of several variables 
so that they are in the original state at the outset for each disk being 
formatted.  Thus DeviceParameters are restored from SavedParams 
and SwitchMap is restored from SwitchCopy.

	All allocated buffers are zeroed out in the routine 
ZeroAllBuffers.

	After prompting the user for the disk to be formatted, disk 
access is ensured through a call to Get_Disk_Access.

	Now module PHASE1 is invoked.  This module primarily 
determines the final value of DeviceParameters to be used in 
formatting the disk.  It also handles all the logical requirements to 
validate a safe format.

	In Phase1Initialisation firstly a media sensing call is made, for 
removable media.  This will utilize new media sensing capabilities of 
the hardware to determine what type of disk is being used.  If this 
function is supported, the BPB field in DeviceParameters will be set to 
that of the media detected.  Media sensing can be supported only on 
3.5in disks.

	The routine Set_BPB_Info is now called to handle the case 
when the disk to be formatted is a non-FAT disk.  This routine will set 
DeviceParameters appropriately in this case. 
Note: This case has not been tested, or ever observed, for that matter.

	The CheckSwitches routine takes action based on the size 
specification switches (/F /N /T /1 /4 /8) entered by the user.  If /F was 
specified, it will be translated into the appropriate value for /N & /T.  
Thus SwitchMap may be modified.  Also, DeviceParameters will be set 
appropriately, for all the formats supported.
Note:  CheckSwitches does NOT modify DeviceParameters if it detects 
that the size specification entered by the user is equal to the default 
size for that drive.  This property is taken into account in determining 
the validity of a safe format in PHASE1.

	Upon return from CheckSwitches, a copy of DeviceParameters 
is saved in SwitchDevParams.

	If the user had specified an unconditional format (/U present), 
the format will be done either according to the entered size 
specification, or else to the default size for the drive (which is its 
maximum capacity).

	If /U is not present, the routine DetermineExistingFormat is 
called.  This routine reads the first 2 sectos and validates the boot
sector (the first sector) on the disk.  If the existing format is found
to be valid, then ResetDeviceParameters is called to copy the BPB read
off the boot sector into that of DeviceParameters.  Further, for removable
media the field DP_CYLINDERS is calculated and set.

	If the disk is not found to have a valid format at this point, 
another routine is called to check in case a disk with a CP/M-type boot 
sector is present (for 160K and 180K disks).  The routine DetermineCPMFormat
validates the first sector of the FAT (the second sector read in 
DetermineExistingFormat) by examining the media descriptor byte.  If this is
found to be a CP/M media descriptor, DeviceParameters will be modified.  
A table of customized BPBs is used for this purpose.  <In short, this is 
an extensive routine which will almost always have to be called, while 
being applicable only in obsolete cases.>

	If the disk if found NOT to have a valid format, a check is made 
to see if there was an error reading the disk due to an open door, etc.  
If so, a message will be given and Format will be terminated.  
Otherwise SwitchMap is checked to see if /Q was specified.  Since 
there is no valid existing format, Quick format cannot be done, so a 
warning message will be issued, and the user will be prompted 
whether or not to continue with an unconditional format.  If the user 
chooses to continue, /Q will be turned off, and /U will be turned on.  

	There is one exception to this logic: the user is allowed to 
enter /Q together with a size specification, which means "Quick format 
all pre-formatted disks with their original format, but format new disks 
with the specified size".  Thus, if /Q is present, SwitchMap is checked 
for (/F, /N or /T) and if these are present, the warning message is not 
given.  Instead, the message is jumped over, and the program 
continues as if the user had entered "Yes" to the continue prompt.  
The code will now continue, with DeviceParameters finalized, at 
DevParamsOk.

	In case the disk is found to have a valid existing format, then 
the values of SwitchDevParams and DeviceParameters are compared 
for equality.  If found to be equal, execution continues at 
DevParamsOk (i.e. there is no conflict between any user-specified 
size and the existing format on disk).  Otherwise a warning message
will be issued since there is a conflict between the entered size or
default size andthe format on disk, and the user will be asked 
whether to proceed with an unconditional format.  If the user chooses 
to continue, /U will be turned on and SwitchDevParams will be copied 
into DeviceParameters, so as to utilize the size specification given by 
the user.

	The only exception to the last case is when /Q is present 
together with a size specification, as explained above. Then a safe 
format will be done using the current disk format.

	After having finalized DeviceParameters, the track layout in 
DeviceParameters is initialized, in the loop LoadSectorTable.  Some 
other initialisation is performed here also, such as determining the 
starting sector, and whether we have a 12 or 16-bit FAT.  The total 
number of clusters is also computed.

	After PHASE1, the MIR_MAIN module will be invoked to create 
the recovery file in case /U has not been turned on.  In order to 
accomodate any buffer space needed by the Mirror utility, it is 
necessary to release the space used by the FatSpace buffer.  This 
buffer is originally made big enough to accomodate all the buffer 
requirements of Mirror (this is FAT + Root Dir + Boot Sector + 6 extra 
sectors + 1 surplus sector to allow for arena headers).  The FatSpace 
buffer is re-allocated upon successful return from Mirror.  In case the 
creation of the recovery file failed, the user will be given the option of 
continuing with an unconditional format.

	Phase2Initialisation performs some calculations relating to the 
format to be performed.

	The routine ShowFormatSize is now called to display the size 
of the format to be done.

	Finally, the actual disk formatting is done in module 
DSKFRMT.  The FatSpace buffer is initialised and loaded with the 
media descriptor byte at the start.  The drive parameters are set to 
those of the intended format through a call to SetDeviceParameters, 
using the DeviceParameters parameter block.  For a Quick format, the 
routine QuickFormat is called.  This pseudo-formats the disk by 
copying all bad cluster markers from the old FAT into the new FAT.  
The old FAT is traversed sequentially, and is read in 1 sector at a 
time, into FatSector.

	In the case of a regular format, SwitchMap is first checked to 
see if /U is present.  If it is, the 'Format and Verify Track' operation will 
be performed on each track.  Otherwise only 'Verify Track' will be 
performed.

	The routine Write_Disk_Info writes out the new boot sector, 
root directory and FAT, as well as the system files, if requested.  Great 
care is taken not to over-write any old files if a system transfer is 
being done together with a safe format.  There are four cases which 
must be addressed here.  These are as follows.

		[1]	Unconditional format without system files
		[2]	Unconditional format with system files
		[3]	Safe format without system files
		[4]	Safe format with system files

	Cases [1], [2] and [3] are all handled the same way.  This is as 
follows.  The boot sector is written out, followed by a zeroed root 
directory, and the new FAT (which is zero except for bad cluster 
markers).  If needed, the system files can now be written out.

	Case [4] is handled in a special way, as described below.  The 
boot sector and a zeroed root directory is written out.  The disk is now 
checked to see if there is enough space for the system files.  At this 
point the old FAT on the disk is still there, so the free space cannot 
overlap any allocated clusters.

	If there is insufficient space, the user will be given a warning 
message and prompted whether to perform a system transfer which 
will prevent later recovery, or just not to transfer the system files.  If 
the user chooses to continue with the transfer, then the old FAT will 
first be over-written with the new FAT, and then system files will be 
written out.  If the user chooses not to continue, the new FAT will be 
written out, and system files will not be transferred.

	If there is sufficient space, then it is necessary to ensure that 
IO.SYS (the first system file) is written out to a location on disk so that 
it is contiguous.  This is achieved by calculating the number of 
clusters needed to accomodate a size of 1.5Kbytes (the maximum 
size of IO.SYS).  This value will be between 1 and 3.  The old FAT will 
then be scanned to find a free cluster block of this size, and disk 
allocation will be forced to start from there, using an undocumented 
DPB function.  In case such a cluster block cannot be found (extremely 
unlikely), the user will be given a warning that system transfer will 
destroy disk files and the program will proceed as described above.  
Once the cluster block is found, the system files are now written out to 
disk.  Since the old FAT is still on disk, this method obviates the 
possibility of over-writing old disk files.  After transfer is complete, the 
FAT chains for the three system files will be copied from the old FAT 
into the new FAT.  Note that the root directory entries will automatically 
appear in the new root directory as the system files are written out.  
The new FAT will then be written out to disk, over the old FAT.

	The routine More prompts the user whether another disk is to 
be formatted.  If the user chooses to format another disk, execution 
will resume at SysLoop, where the original state of parameters will be 
restored.

SAFEFORMAT

=======================================================================

The following new source files have been added to the format
directory.

      SAFE.ASM    - Additional program source code
      SAFE.INC    - Extrn definitions to be included in other modules
      SAFEDEF.INC - Structure and equates used in SAFE.ASM
      NEWFMT.DOC  - This information and specification file


All changes to the existing format program have been incorporated
within conditionals. The defined value SAFE will determine whether
the new safe format is built. The build the safe format add the
command line switch for the assembler "-DSAFE=1". To disable
creation of the safe format and build the normal format program
change the switch to -DSAFE=0.

=======================================================================

The design specification for the MS-DOS 4.x safe format and unformat
utility is based on the these underlying assumptions.


FORMAT assumptions:

  1.  The utility is version dependent and will alway fail to run
      under versions of DOS (as reported by DOS function 30h)
      other the version it was designed for.

  2.  The utility will only attempt to preserve and restore existing
      DOS 4.x compatible parititions.

  3.  The utililty will incorporate general safty features but will
      rely on the integrety of the underlying operating system for
      detecting error conditions while accessing the hard disk.

  4.  There will be no attempt to allow restoration of a partition
      which was recognized as being damaged before the format
      operation had begun.

  5.  If for any reason the restoration files cannot be created
      the user will notified and allowed to decide if the format
      should continue without the restoration ability. There is
      one exception to this assumption and that is the case where
      a partition is detected to be unformated as described later.

  6.  The default operation during format will be to create the
      restoration file. A command line switch will allow the user
      to disable the feature.

  7.  All disk access will be done via DOS file handles and interrupts
      25h and 26h to allow DOS to detect and return any error
      conditions.

  8.  Only the first copy of the FAT will be saved. If any sectors
      in the first copy of the FAT cannot be successfully read
      using int 25h, an attempt will be made to read the corresponding
      sectors from the second copy of the FAT. Only if the
      corresponding sectors in both copies of the FAT cannot be read
      will it be assumed the the FAT is bad and a restoration file
      cannot be created.

  9.  The restoration file must contain all information neccessary
      to allow the restoration program to restore the original
      partition immediately after a format. If the original partition
      was a boot partition it must be restored so that it will boot
      the original operating system which was present before the
      format operation.

  10. The system files will consist of the either of the following
      2 groups of files plus COMMAND.COM.
      (IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS) or (IBMBIO.SYS and IBMDOS.SYS)

  11. It will be assumed that a partition has never been formatted
      if the boot record is not valid using the conditions that the
      last 2 bytes of a boot sector contain a boot signature and
      the first byte is near or short jump opcode. When a partition
      has never been formatted a restoration file will not be
      created. There will be no need to alert the user to this action
      and formating will proceed as it does with the existing DOS 4.x
      utility.

  12. The restoration file will be created in the root directory
      before formating begins and this directory entry will be
      restored to the root directory as the 4th entry in the new
      root directory with an E5h placed in the first byte of the
      first 3 directory entries to allow room for operating system
      files. The restoration file will use the name "UNFORMAT.DAT"
      and will be created with HIDDEN, SYSTEM and READONLY
      attributes set.

  13. Any previous restoration file will be deleted at the time
      a new restoration file is created.

      WARNING: This will mean that if a user reformats a hard
      disk immediately after a previous format, the original
      contents of the hard disk will be lost.

  14. The restoration file will be designed so that it can allow
      restoration of the hard disk reguardless of the condition of
      boot sector, FAT or root directory after completion of the
      format operation. This feature is only for possible future
      enhancements and in this implementation there will be no
      attempt to restore a hard disk if the restoration file
      cannot be successfully read from the disk using the normal
      DOS file and sector read and write operations.

  15. The FAT which is written to the restoration file will also
      contain the FAT allocation chain for the restoration file.

  16. The DOS control C check will be disabled while the system areas
      of the disk are being written to help minimize the chance of
      losing the restoration file's directory entry and FAT chain.

      NOTE:
      The user will still be allowed to CTRL C out of the format at
      any time previous to this without damaging the integrity of
      the existing partition other than the deletion of any
      previously existing restoration file. 

  17. There will be 2 checksums in the restoration file header. One
      will be a checksum of the sector containing the file header
      and the other will be a checksum of the entire restoration
      file. The file header checksum will be used to confirm the
      file header is the valid starting sector of a restoration
      file and the file checksum will be used to insure the
      integrety of entire restoration file before a restoration
      is done.

  18. The information contained in the restoration file is intended
      to only allow the restoration of a hard disk partition if the
      UNFORMAT utility is used before any new files are written to
      the partition after a format operation. If any new files are
      written the partition is formatted it will void the integrety
      of the original FAT and the partition will be corrupt.

  19. The FORMAT utility must allow restoration of the original
      partition even in the event that the /S option is used to
      install a new operating system on the partition. This will
      be accomplished by assuring that the new OS does not
      overwrite any existing allocated areas other than the first
      2 clusters of the disk which have been saved in the restoration
      file.

  20. The fatal disk error handler will be changed so that IGNORE is
      not an option for handling of fatal disk errors. Only RETRY,
      FAIL and ABORT will be valid options.

Before You Call for Support on a Setup Issue
=======================================================================

Before you call for support on a Setup issue, run the NHTQ tool using
Makedisk.bat from \Support\Hqtool on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc. For more information on using this tool, see "Using NHTQ if Setup
Fails" later in this document.

At a minimum, we recommend you gather the following information: 

	Version of Windows NT 
	Upgrade or fresh install 
	Forms of setup attempted (Setup boot disk, winnt, winnt /b) 
	At exactly what point does setup fail? 
	What exact error message is given, if any 
	Has the system been scanned for a virus? 
	Computer make/model 
	Bus type (EISA/ISA/MCA/PCI) 
	Memory (RAM) 
	Disk controllers 
	Disk/type/size 
	CD-ROM 
	Tape drive 
	Network adapter 
	Serial ports 
	Other adapters 

The following additional information may also be of use in getting your 
problem solved:

For your computer - 

	BIOS version 
	Was Setup tried with Shadowing disabled? 
	Was Setup tried with External Cache disabled? 


For SCSI controllers -

	IRQ, DMA channel, I/O address 
	SCSI BIOS version 
	SCSI IDs of devices 
	Which devices have termination enabled? 
	Greater than 1 GB support enabled on adapter? 
	Max Sync Xfer Rate on adapter 
	Have hard drives been low level formatted on this adapter? 
	Using driver from distribution media or vendor supplied driver? 


For IDE controllers -

	IRQ, DMA channel, I/O address 
	Dual channel controller? 
	Translation used for drives having more than 1024 cylinders
         (LBA/Disk Manager) 


For disk drives -

	Partition information 
	Cylinder, heads, sectors per track 
	Is write cache enabled or disabled on hard disk drives? 


For tape drives -

	Firmware version 
	Placement in SCSI chain 


For network adapter -

	IRQ, RAM address, I/O address



Creating Windows NT Setup Startup Disks
=======================================================================

If your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server Setup floppy disks 
become corrupted, or are misplaced, you can create a new set by using
Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe from your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT
Server compact disc. These disks can be used to start Windows NT Workstation
or Windows NT Server Setup, or can be used with your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Note
You can create these boot disks from a computer running MS-DOS, Windows
version 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation, or
Windows NT Server.

To create Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server startup disks:

     1. Insert the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc
        into a CD-ROM drive.
     2. From the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive and the
        correct platform folder (for example, \I386 for x86-based
        computers).
     3. If the computer you are using is running Windows NT, type:

        winnt32 /ox

        at the command prompt, press Enter, and follow the instructions.

If the computer you are using is running MS-DOS or Windows version 3.1,
Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95, type winnt /ox at the command prompt,
press Enter, and follow the instructions.


El Torito (No Emulation) Bootable CD-ROM Format
=======================================================================

If your computer's BIOS does not support the El Torito (no emulation)
bootable CD-ROM format, you might get an error when you start your computer
with the Windows NT compact disc inserted in the CD-ROM drive. To work
around this problem, remove the compact disc from the CD-ROM drive and
restart your computer.


Setting Up Windows NT version 4.0 on Computers with
Multiple CD-ROM Drives Installed
=======================================================================

If you have multiple compact disc drives installed, place the Windows NT 
compact disc in the drive that has first priority on your computer.


Windows NT SCSI Driver Changes
=======================================================================

With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT
Driver Library (\DRVLIB) included on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc. Check the following list to determine if any of your adapters are
affected by this change. If your computer has an adapter that appears on
this list, you must create a driver disk before installing Windows NT
version 4.0. Use this disk to install the appropriate driver(s) during
Setup, or keep the disk handy and install the driver using the Control Panel
once Setup is complete.

The following drivers have been moved:

     always.sys
     dtc329x.sys
     t128.syst13b.sys
     tmv1.sys
     ultra124.sys
     wd33c93.sys

The following adapters are affected by this change:

SCSI ADAPTERS -

     Always IN-2000
     Data Technology Corp. 3290
     Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter
     MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum-16
     Trantor T-128
     Trantor T-130B

DISK CONTROLLERS -

     UltraStor 124f EISA Disk Array Controller

Please see the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List for additional
information on these storage adapters.

To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver
Library:

     1. Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.
     2. Copy all files from the following directory to the blank disk:

        \drvlib\storage\retired\CPU_TYPE

        where CPU_TYPE is X86 if you are using a machine with an x86-based
        processor; MIPS if your computer uses a MIPS RISC processor; or
        ALPHA if your computer uses a Digital Alpha processor.
     3. Label this disk "Drivers Disk".

To install drivers from the drivers disk during Windows NT version 4.0
Setup:

     1. Start Windows NT Setup. 
        During the course of Setup, a message appears stating "Setup has
        recognized the following mass storage devices in your computer." 
     2. When prompted, press S to skip detection, then press S again to
        display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     3. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     4. Insert the Drivers Disk when prompted to do so, and select your host
        adapter from this list.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host
adapters without making the devices attached to it available for use:

     1. Restart Windows NT Setup. 
     2. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
        computer's hardware configuration...," press F6. 
        This prevents Windows NT Setup from performing disk controller
        detection and allows you to install the driver from the Drivers Disk
        you created. Note that all SCSI adapters will have to be installed
        manually.
     3. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not
        determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in
        your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter,"
        press S to display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     4. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     5. Insert the Drivers Disk you made when prompted to do so, and select
        your host adapter from this list. Note that in some cases, Windows
        NT Setup will repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers from your drivers disk after running Windows NT version
4.0 Setup:

     1. After installing the properly configured adapter in your machine,
        start Windows NT version 4.0 as normal.
     2. Click Start, point to Control Panel, then open the SCSI Adapters
        program.
     3. Select the Drivers tab, then click the Add button.
     4. Click the Have Disk button, insert your drivers disk into Drive A:,
        and then click OK.
     5. Highlight the desired driver from the list presented, and then click
        OK. Then, click Continue to load the driver.
     6. You need to restart your Windows NT version 4.0 system to activate
        the driver. Click the Restart Computer button to shutdown and
        restart.

Warning:

If you are upgrading from Windows NT version 3.51, you must know the names
of all SCSI adapters before running Setup. To view this list, open Windows
NT Setup (in the Main program group in Windows NT version 3.51) and click
Add/Remove SCSI Adapters on the Options menu. Record the names of all
adapters on this list and keep them handy for use during Windows NT version
4.0 Setup.


Network Adapter Drivers
=======================================================================

Microsoft provides network adapter drivers from third-party vendors on the 
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact discs.
These drivers, which are located in the \DRVLIB folder have all met 
specific standards of installation and operation. 

Most PCI, EISA, and MCA adapters in the \DRVLIB can be detected and
successfully installed during Setup. Most ISA and PCMCIA adapters are not
detected but can be installed manually during Setup. 

For ISA adapters that can be detected, two identical adapters cannot be
detected during Setup.  The adapter with the lowest I\O address will be
detected, while the others will not. They can, however, be installed
manually added. For multiprocessor systems, two identical ISA adapters may
not be supported due to hardware limitations of the adapter.  The NE2000 is
an example of this limitation.

Most network adapters in the \DRVLIB do not support the unattended answer 
file (unattend.txt) for use in automated installations of Windows NT.  
Exceptions are the IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring Adapter, IBM AutoStreamer 
Token Ring adapters, IBM Token Ring LanStreamer PCI adapter, 3Com 
Etherlink III PCI adapters, and the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B adapter.

Some adapters may quit functioning if you upgrade from an earlier version to 
the Windows NT version 4.0.  This can be caused by changes in the registry,
such as adapter driver name changes, service dependency changes, or an
obsolete network adapter driver. Removing the old driver and installing it
again from the menu will correct the startup problem for adapters listed on
the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).  Xircom IIPS and Eicon ISDN are
examples of adapters that must be reinstalled.

Some adapters generate errors during Setup because the configuration
settings cannot be verified.  This can be caused by conflicting settings for 
interrupt and I/O addresses.   The error can also be displayed if Setup
calls an executable helper which sets up the configuration.  If the adapter
driver starts and connects to the network, the error can be ignored.  If
not, the error is an indication there are resource conflicts which will have
to be fixed.  The Intel E100B and IBM Streamer adapters are examples of
drivers that use their own executable setup routines.

Microsoft does not recommend the use of 8-bit network adapters with 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server. Support for these adapters 
is included in some cases due to customer requirements, but older hardware 
represented by this technology does not provide good performance or 
reliability.

> Network PnP Mode

PnP mode is not supported. Network adapters that support PnP mode must be 
reconfigured with a software setup utility provided by the manufacturer. This 
includes system board mounted network adapters, 3Com EtherLink III B
models, and Standard Microsystems SMC8416 Ultra PnP adapters.

> Bus-Master Adapters

Bus-Master adapters are not supported on Motorola Power PC computers. 
These include the Proteon p1390, p1392, p1392plus, and IBM 4/16 Token 
Ring Adapter II. IBM Power PC systems are supported.

> PCMCIA Adapters

If your PCMCIA adapter does not start, or operates incorrectly, try using a 
different interrupt for the network adapter. Interrupts 2, 5, and 10 are
often reserved on portable computers. In these cases, Microsoft recommends 
changing the interrupt to 3, 11, or 15. If the settings are changed during 
installation, the adapter will not start until installation is completed and the
system is restarted. If you know the settings presented by Setup
will cause a conflict, you can change them, but the adapter will not start
until installation is completed and the computer is restarted.

> Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) Adapters

During Setup, selecting any Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) adapters
will result in a dialog box that cannot be exited. This will cause the
installation to fail because rebooting is necessary to recover. For these
adapters, complete the installation and add the adapter later.

> Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps

Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps adapters will stop 
working if you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51. Because the driver 
name changed for this adapter, and because of the subsequent effect on the 
registry, the IIps adapter must be manually removed and reinstalled.

> Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter drivers

If you install Windows NT version 4.0 from a network drive and have both
an Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter driver and a PCI SCSI 
controller installed, Setup may indicate one or more files are corrupt when
it verifies the copy from the temporary directory to the 
%systemroot%\system32\drivers folder.

This problem occurs because the network adapter is not reset correctly when 
Setup warm starts the computer. You can avoid this problem by turning the 
computer off and then back on instead of allowing Setup to warm start the 
computer.

> Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN Adapters

Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN adapters do not always work correctly in
multibus PCI-based computers.

> NE2000 or Compatible Network Adapters

Installing or upgrading to Windows NT 4.0 with a NE2000 or compatible
network adapter set to an I/O address of 340 hex, may cause the system to
hang when booting into text-mode Setup. If this occurs, either remove the
NE2000 adapter or change its I/O address and restart Setup to continue the
installation. The NE2000 will operate normally at I/O address 340 hex after
Setup is complete.

> AMD PCnet Adapters on Intergraph TD Workstations

Detecting early versions of the AMD PCnet adapter can cause the system to 
hang.  If this occurs, restart Windows NT Setup by rebooting the computer,
select the AM1500T network adapter and set the configuration parameters
manually to match the jumpers.  Intergraph models TD-1, TD2 and TD-3 
are examples of computers with the early AMD adapter built onto the 
system board.


Duplexing with the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA Controller
=======================================================================

If you utilize the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA controller and require 
duplexing with mirrored partitions, both controllers must be set to use 
64 heads/32 sectors translation.  The EISA partition and the operating 
system partition must both be located in the first 1024 cylinders.  It is 
also recommended both drives posses the same SCSI ID number.  By 
default, this is 0.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact Compaq 
support for details on advanced configuration options.

If the primary drive fails, it will be neccessay to move the shadowed drive 
to the first controller in order to restart the computer.  An alternate solution
is to change the controller boot order.  Make the shadowed drive's controller 
the primary boot controller.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact 
Compaq support for details on advanced configuration options.


Winnt/Winnt32 Disk Space Errors
=======================================================================

Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe will report an error if unable to find a drive
with enough diskspace available, or if the drive specified with the /t
switch has insufficient free disk space.  If such an error occurs, you must
free some disk space and then run Winnt or Winnt32 again.

In some cases, Winnt and Winnt32 will not report a disk space error, but at
some point during the file copy process, will report an error copying a
file due to lack of disk space. This occurs when the drive to which the
temporary directory, $win_nt$~ls, is being copied is formatted with a
cluster of size 32KB or greater and has only the minimum free disk space
allowed. If this error occurs, you must free additional disk space, and
re-run winnt/winnt32.

Running Windows NT Setup from MS-DOS 6.20 may cause invalid 
filename errors on files that start with an exclamation point.  The 
error message can be ignored and the files can be skipped.


HPFS File Systems
=======================================================================

Windows NT version 4.0 does not support the OS/2 File System (HPFS). You 
cannot access disks that are formatted with HPFS from Windows NT version
4.0. If you have a previous version of Windows NT installed on a disk
formatted with HPFS, Setup cannot upgrade it to Windows NT version 4.0.

You can use the Convert.exe program supplied with previous versions of 
Windows NT to convert disks formatted with HPFS to the Windows NT File 
System (NTFS). Windows NT version 4.0 Convert.exe does not provide this
capability. Do not convert any disks you need to access when using other
operating systems such as OS/2.

Note:
Convert.exe can convert only HPFS version 1.x drives smaller than 4
gigabytes (GB). It fails on HPFS 2.x drives (those HPFS drives larger than 4
GB).


Windows Messaging
=======================================================================

Note
The following information does not apply if you are running the Exchange
Client for Microsoft Exchange Server.

If you are a currently running Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 and
are using the Exchange Client, use the following procedure to remove 
Microsoft Exchange before upgrading to Windows NT version 4.0.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and then install Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     3. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Microsoft Exchange check
        box, and then click OK.
     4. After Microsoft Exchange has been removed, start Windows NT
        version 4.0 Setup.
     5. When prompted to select the type of installation, click Custom
        Setup.
     6. On the Select Components page, select Windows Messaging (new 
        name for Exchange in Windows NT version 4.0).

If you are a Windows NT 4.0 Beta Exchange Client user and you have already
installed Windows NT version 4.0 (final), you need to remove Exchange and
reinstall Windows Messaging to ensure proper operation of the Messaging
Client.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and install Windows Messaging after upgrading
from Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 to  Windows NT version 4.0
(final):

     1. Right-click the Taskbar, click Properties.
     2. On the Start menu Programs tab, click Remove.
     3. Select Microsoft Exchange from the list, and then click Remove.
     4. Click Close, and then click OK.
     5. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     6. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     7. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Windows Messaging check box,
        and then click OK.


Using Schedule+ 1.0 with Windows Messaging in NT 4.0
=======================================================================

Windows Messaging is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
When Windows Messaging is installed, you can still use Schedule+ 1.0 in
standalone mode, but you will not be able to send or receive meeting requests.

You are eligible for a free upgrade to Schedule+ 7.0.  In the U.S.,
call 1-800-360-7561. In Canada call, 1-800-933-4750. Outside the U.S.
and Canada, contact your local dealer.


Disable FPNW/DSMN for Windows NT Server version 3.51 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you are performing an upgrade from Windows NT Server 3.51 with FPNW or 
DSMN services installed on the computer, these services are not compatible 
with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Microsoft Services for NetWare will be released 
shortly for use with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Prior to upgrading to Windows NT 
Server 4.0, disable these services by selecting Control Panel, Services.  Select 
"File and Print Services for NetWare" or "Directory Service Manager for NetWare" 
from the list, click Startup then click Disabled.  You should not attempt to reinstall 
FPNW or DSMN for Windows NT Server 3.51 on Windows NT Server 4.0. 


Upgrading DNS Servers
=======================================================================

Before upgrading a Windows NT version 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server to
Windows NT version 4.0, you need to delete some registry entries. For more
information, see "To Upgrade a Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server" and
"To Install a DNS Server" in TCP/IP Help.


Upgrading WINS, DHCP, and RPL Databases
=======================================================================
	 
The information in this section pertains only to Windows NT Server. When
upgrading a Windows NT Server version 3.51 (or earlier) release to Windows
NT version 4.0, the databases for WINS, DHCP, and RPL must be converted to
the new database format. This is required because the services now use an
improved database engine that is faster and that compacts automatically to
prevent fragmentation and consequential growth of the database. The database
conversion procedure occurs automatically as part of an upgrade
installation.


Removing Remotely Possible/32 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you have Remotely Possible/32 version 2.0 or 2.1 installed on a computer
running Windows NT version 3.51, you must uninstall Remotely Possible before 
installing Windows NT version 4.0. If you do not, Windows NT might not
install correctly. You can uninstall Remotely Possible by running the
Remove.bat file located on the Remotely Possible distribution disk. After
you have upgraded to Windows NT version 4.0, you can reinstall Remotely
Possible.

For more information about running Remotely Possible/32 versions 2.0 and 2.1
under Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0, see the
Remotely Possible/32 section in "Application Notes" in Readme.wri.


Detecting and Disabling the Floating-Point Division Error
=======================================================================

Setup automatically detects the Intel Pentium floating-point division error.
If the error is detected on your system, Setup prompts you to disable the
floating-point hardware on the chip. If you choose not to have the
floating-point hardware disabled during Setup, you can disable the hardware
later with a command line utility called Pentnt.exe.


Digital Alpha Systems
=======================================================================

If you are installing this release on a Digital Alpha system, please consult
the Release Notes available from:
	http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/sysoft.htm


Micron Computers
=======================================================================

If you encounter problems during Windows NT version 4.0 Setup on your Micron
computer, upgrade your system BIOS to the latest BIOS version available from
Micron.


Displaying Setup on Laptop Computers
=======================================================================

During text mode setup, some laptops with the WDC 90C24 chipset may show
some screen text distortion.

Laptops support a mode that adds additional scan lines between rows of
characters. This allows the entire LCD to be used when in 80x25 line text
modes. However, when in 43 line text mode (the mode in which Windows NT
Setup runs), the additional scan lines are forced off the bottom of the 
display. Certain laptop machines that start in this mode exhibit this 
behavior. Users encountering this problem will not be able to see the white 
instruction line on the bottom of the setup screen. This line indicates what 
keystrokes are used to exit and continue Setup. Continue with Setup and the
video drivers will be reset upon entering the graphical (GUI) portion of
Windows NT Setup.


Disconnecting UPS Devices
=======================================================================

Disconnect the serial cable connecting an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 
device before running Setup. Windows NT attempts to automatically detect 
devices connected to serial ports, which can cause problems with UPS equipment.


Intergraph G91 Display Adapters
=======================================================================

The Weitek-compatible display driver included with Windows NT version 4.0
does not work with the Intergraph G91 display adapters. Contact Intergraph
for an updated driver.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0, run the
G91 display driver provided with the Intergraph computer.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. During the Windows NT version 4.0 Setup process, click Cancel when
        the Display Settings dialog box is displayed.
     2. Once installation has been completed, load the drivers supplied with
        the Intergraph computer.


Sound Blaster/SCSI Problems
=======================================================================

Sound Blaster/SCSI cards and PCI SCSI cards may display a blue screen
reading INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE when performing a new installation or an
upgrade. This occurs because the BIOS assigns the PCI SCSI card an interrupt
that is already in use.  If this occurs, physically remove the sound card
before reinstalling, or remove the driver during text mode portion of Setup
and then reinstall after the installation/upgrade is complete.


Devices That Must be Manually Installed
=======================================================================

The following devices must be manually installed. Do not choose to have
Windows NT version 4.0 Setup automatically detect them.

 E-Tech Pocket Fax/Modem
 Multi-tech Multimodem (various models)
 Penril modems (various models)

The Modems option in Control Panel will close when you attempt to
query these devices.


Using Multiple Windows NT Installations on a Single Computer
=======================================================================

If you are installing Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0 on a
computer already loaded with at least one other Windows NT installation,
and if the computer participates on a Windows NT domain, you must use a
different computer name and machine account for each Windows NT
installation. This is because a unique security identifier (SID) is used for 
each installation of Windows NT on a domain.


Using NTHQ If Setup Fails
=======================================================================

NTHQ detects the installed hardware components on x86-based computers. It 
was designed to assist Microsoft Product Support engineers when a computer
does not boot or becomes unstable. 

To use NTHQ, run Makedisk.bat from the \support\hqtool directory on the 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc. Makedisk.bat
creates a bootable floppy disk that you can use to start your computer and
automatically run the diagnostic tool.

AUTHOR:  	SUNIL PAI
DATE:		Sept. 28, 1993.   Version 1.0.
REVISED: 	Dec. 8, 1993.  Version 1.1 (Rearranged to separate functionality which is not being implemented).

REQUIREMENTS

1. Upgrade 1.0 to 1.0a.
2. Upgrade 1.0AS to 1.0aAS.
3. Upgrade 1.0 to 1.0a AS.  [WON'T BE IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0a]
4. Implement safety features in upgrade, making sure that we don't end up with an unbootable system either because of some error during setup or due to external factors like power failure or user induced failure.


WORK INVOLVED IN UPGRADING

1. Copy over new versions of the files and new files that need to be always copied.
2. Make registry changes (1.0 -> 1.0a)
3. Make program group changes and the registry.  (1.0 -> 1.0a)
4. Do the Winnt-> AS changes if it is such an upgrade. [NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0a]
5. Generate a repair diskette for the new system.
6. Set up the new system for secure operation.
7. Do all the above in a safe manner.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

1. Upgrade in place.  That is upgrade our running tree to a 1.0a system.  The main problem with this is that we need to be careful we don't end up with an unbootable system.

2. Install a new version and upgrade information from the current tree.  The problems with this are that it is hard to clone a tree from the current tree and be sure we have everything we need.  Third party software is a big issue.  It is difficult to transfer configuration information from one tree to another.  Also one can never no where there are hard coded paths to stuff.   Also the disk space requirement prevents most people from using this approach.  The advantage in this is that it is safe.  If the new tree doesn't work, the old tree is still around.

We are choosing to upgrade in place.

ALGORITHM TO UPGRADE IN PLACE

Upgrade is done basically by text setup.  It is possible to run a utility to gather information from a running system and apply it as an answer to the questions asked by text setup, however this is not implemented for this release.   The following is the sequence of events in an upgrade.

- Text setup boots and asks for hardware information.  May ask for third party driver information.  This is solely for use during Setup and is not applied to the tree to be upgraded.
- Finds out all NT installations which can be upgraded by looking at the boot.ini/NVRAM variables.  It applies the following criteria to check if a system can be upgraded.
	- An NT tree actually exists as described by the boot.ini/NVRAM boot set.
	- Version as found from the registry on the tree is less than or equal to the current version.  
	- The type of NT ( WINNT/AS) is the same as our current product.
- The valid installations are presented to the user. The user can choose to upgrade an installation or choose a new tree for installation.  
	- If the user had attempted to upgrade the tree before, the user is warned about this and can choose to either reattempt the upgrade or install fresh into the same tree, backing up the hives.  
	- If the tree chosen for upgrade doesn't have enough space or its corresponding system partition doesn't have enough space, the user is warned about this.  The user can either exit setup and create enough space or choose another tree for upgrade or specify another tree to install.
Note that if there is a single tree for upgrade, all the analysis above is done without user input and then the user is presented with the appropriate dialog for input.
- If the user selects to cancel upgrade, he is given the choice of selecting a new partition / directory.  If the partition / directory he selects is the same one as the one offered to him before ( from the osloader or from the NT installations) the user is again offered the choice of upgrade / fresh install.  If he indicates he wants to install fresh we will clean out the NT tree except for the known hives which are renamed.
- If the user accepts upgrade, text setup marks the registry on the system with the upgradeinprogress value.  It then adds the system ( minus new network stuff  and hives and minus other files if a win31 system also present in same place) to the copy list and copies it.  The files are only copied if present on the target unless marked mandatory.  It also deletes files which have been removed from the product since 1.0.
- Does whatever registry modification is needed in the system hive:
	- Deletes keys that have disappeared since 1.0.
	- Add keys that have been added since 1.0 and the values within.
	- Disables the network services from starting, storing the old start values.  Other services may also be disabled if they cause service controller popups.
- Sets up for winlogon to execute setup in upgrade mode (tell setup - it is an upgrade, - win31 also present in directory, - where source is.).
- Continue the boot.
- When winlogon executes setup in upgrade mode it does not block SAM initialization.  Just runs gui setup before running winlogon.
- Gui setup comes up, realizes it is an upgrade in initial.inf.  It does the following:
	- [Do any registry modifications that can be deferred from the text setup stage to the gui stage].
                - Make the product version and source entries.
- Calls network setup to upgrade the network.
	- Sets up for setacl conversion.
	- Prepares emergency repair diskette. (is it possible to hold hives as they may be big?)
	- If  process succeeded delete local source if present and clear the UpgradeInProgress and SetupInProgress values.
	- Invokes perfmon provided code to convert the old perfmon data into the new format.
	- Reboots.
- If the above process fails then user can always install a fresh 1.0a system into the NT tree.

NETWORK UPGRADE (PROVIDED BY TERRYK)

1.	In text mode setup, the upgrade.inf file will copy all the network related inf files (oem*.inf) to the system with all the other setup files.
2.	During second boot (GUI) setup, it will do the following:
2.1.	Search under "Registry\Machine\Software\Microsoft\XXX\CurrentVersion\NetRules" (where XXX is the network components) and get a list of update inf file names and inf options. We will skip all the file name which ends with a number (i.e., oemnsv04.inf) because they may not belonged to Microsoft.
2.2.	Call each inf file with [Upgrade] option with the src path points to the CD or floppy disk. The new inf file will put the upgrade file list into the setup copy list. Meanwhile, the inf file will also upgrade the registry for the upgrade component (if necessary).
2.3.	If the update option list contains special component (i.e., TCP/IP, NetBT , streams,...), we will call the new inf file with [Install] option to install the new component. The new inf file should take care of the old components by either disable the components or remove the components from the registry directly.
2.4.	Call setup's [copyfilelist] to copy the upgrade files before we start the network control panel.
2.5.	Enable all the network services by changing the StartType value to the original one (which we saved during text mode setup).
2.6.	Start Network Control Panel Applet.
2.7.	Recompute binding
2.8.	Restart network
2.9.	Query domain name in Winnt->AS case and do necessary.[NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0A]

SAFETY DURING UPGRADE

Since we are upgrading in place, there are chances that midway through the upgrade we may fail and the user ends up with an unbootable system.  To guard against this we need to implement safety measures.  We are not implementing measures to let the user go back to the old system.  The user is only guaranteed to end up with a new system which boots.

Journalling was considered as a measure to implement safety, however it is too difficult to implement in the given timeframe.

What is implemented is the following:

- On failure the user can always reattempt upgrade.  Upgrade is designed in such a way that it can be reapplied any number of times without any restrictions.  If you fail during the upgrade process you can boot text setup again and reapply upgrade.

- In the remote possibility that upgrade just doesn't end up yielding a good system, the user can always install fresh into the same tree and Setup will back up the hives for the user.  Tools can be provided with the resource kit to extract information from the backed up hives and reapply them to the new hives.  The difficult part here may be the account information.

WINNT->AS UPGRADE  [NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR 1.0A]

On AS systems we need to provide for a WINNT->AS upgrade.   This can be a WINNT -> Primary Domain controller or a WINNT -> Backup Domain controller.  We are not considering WINNT->Backup Domain controller because of the following reasons:

- Most cases of an AS upgrade are going to be in environments where a person will upgrade his WINNT machine which has lots of accounts to a Primary Domain controller.
- Changing the WINNT to a backup domain controller involves changing the sid of the account domain to the sid of the Primary Domain controller and fixing any place where this sid appears.  This is definitely not trivial, if not impossible.
- The work involved will take us more than the 1.0a timeframe.

The work involved in converting a WINNT -> Primary Domain controller is:

- Text setup to set the registry to block SAM initilization on GUI Setup boot.  Also pass an input parameter to GUI Setup indicating that we have a WINNT-AS upgrade.	
- During GUI Setup network setup queries domain name in Winnt->AS case and applies it to the registry.
-GUI Setup creates event "\NT_CONVERT_TO_AS" to inform Sam that the database needs to be converted and sets event "\INSTALLATION_SECURITY_HOLD" to ask SAM to start the process.
- SAM starts the conversion process and does the following:
	- Create additional GlobalGroups:
		- Domain Admins
		- Domain Users
		- Domain Replicator
	- Change "None" GlobalGroup to "Users" GlobalGroup
	- Create additional LocalGroups:
		- System Operators
		- Account Operators
		- Print Operators
	- Change ACLs in SAM
		- Account Operators now used
	- Delete PowerUsers LocalGroup [TBD: CAN THIS BE LEFT AROUND, THIS CAN SIMPLIFY THE UPGRADE]
	- Signals event "\SAM_SERVICE_STARTED" once it is done.
- Setup waits on event "\SAM_SERVICE_STARTED"  which is signalled when initialization is done.
- Change the product type in the registry to AS.
- Does the stuff needed by LSA:
 	- Add a privilege to the administrators account.
- If Winnt -> AS creates the extra common program group to hold AS items.

IMPLEMENTATION

MAKING UPGRADE REGISTRY ENTRIES IN THE SIF FILE

Brief Description of Registry Changes During Upgrade

- Copy over the new hives as systnew, softnew, deftnew.  These are available as templates for our use.
- Save the perflib data & disable the network components in the destination  hive.
- Recurse down the controlset001 in systnew and copy any keys/values NOT PRESENT in the destination. Do the same with the softnew hive.
- Delete all keys listed in the sif file.
- Add all keys / values listed in the sif file.

Sections:

1. The following section allows us to specify services to disable which may
cause popups when net services are disabled:

[NetServicesToDisable]
ServiceName1
...

2. The following section allows us to remove keys which have been removed
since the Windows NT 3.1 release.  The key is deleted recursively, all
subkeys are deleted too.

[KeysToDelete]
<RootName>, <RootRelativePath>
...

where <RootName> ::=  System | Software | Default | ControlSet

An example of this is:

ControlSet, Services\hpfs_rec.


3. The following sections allow us to add/change keys / values under keys which have changed since the Windows NT 3.1 release.  Most changes are picked up the recursive comparison of the hives that is executed first. New keys and values need not be listed in this section.  This section is to catch the following cases:

   - When the hive has been changed since 511 and somebody changes the
     same value again.
   - When some value which already exists in the hive is changed.

[KeysToAdd]
<RootName>, <RootRelativePath> [, <ValueSection>]
...

If the <ValueSection> is not specified, the template hive is used to find out all subkeys/values to create under the root name.  If the <ValueSection> is specified it is of the following format:

[<ValueSection>]
<ValueName> [, <ValueType>, <ValueData>]
...

<ValueType> and <ValueData> are optional and when these are not specified the template hive is used to find out what these should be.  More often we do not need to use the <ValueType> and <ValueData>.  The only time we need to use these is when the data in the template hives is not what we want in the final registry.

Format of the value is the following:

a. Type REG_SZ:          name , REG_SZ,           "value string"
b. Type REG_EXPAND_SZ    name , REG_EXPAND_SZ,    "value string"
c. Type REG_MULTI_SZ     name , REG_MULTI_SZ,     "value string1", "value string2", ...
d. Type REG_BINARY       name , REG_BINARY,       byte1, byte2, ...
e. Type REG_BINARY_DWORD name , REG_BINARY_DWORD, dword1, dword2, ...
f. Type REG_DWORD        name , REG_DWORD,        dword

examples:

System, REG_SZ, lsass.exe
MyValue
Hello1, REG_EXPAND_SZ, "%SystemRoot%\nt\system32"
DeleteList, REG_MULTI_SZ, "file1" "file2" "file3"
Data, REG_BINARY, 00, 01, 02, 0a, 1f
VideoGroupOrder, REG_BINARY_DWORD, 00000001, 0000000a, 0000000f
Start, REG_DWORD, 00000003


REG_BINARY_DWORD is actually REG_BINARY however it lets us specify the binary data using dwords. All data in the value data is in hex, however don't prefix the data with 0x.  This is assumed.

=== C:/Users/treeman/Desktop/windows nt source code\Source\Win2K3\NT\base\ntsetup\textmode\spddlang\spddlang.txt ===
This file details an interface to be used to supply locale/language-specific
function for display, keyboard handling, etc, within text setup.

The goals are as follows:

1) Provide a straightforward means for supporting fully localized text display,
   keyboard handling, and other features, in various locales, especially
   Far Eastern ones.

2) Avoid impacting setupdd.sys's size or performance when such function is not
   required.

To this end features such as DBCS font support, locale-specific keyboard detection,
and various other features are to be removed and placed into an export driver.
Setupdd.sys will be linked such that this driver is automatically referenced
and loaded when setupdd.sys is loaded. Setupdd.sys will itself export a set of
routines for use by the language-specific driver when carrying out its function.

Language-specific drivers will be built in the setup\textmode\spddlang directory.
Such drivers are logically part of setupdd.sys. No special set of include files
will be created for the interfaces below; they will be contained in various
header files in setup\textmode\kernel. Language-specific drivers' SOURCES files
should be set up so they include setup\textmode\kernel in their INCLUDES and

NTSTATUS
SplangInitializeFontSupport(
    IN PCWSTR BootDevicePath,
    IN PCWSTR DirectoryOnBootDevice
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to allow the language-specific
    font support to be initialized. The language-specific driver should
    load any font it requires and perform any additioanl initialization.

Arguments:

    BootDevicePath - supplies the path of the device from which the system
        booted. This is a full NT-style path that includes a directory spec.

    DirectoryOnBootDevice - supplies directory relative to root of boot
        device.

Return Value:

    NT Status code indicating outcome. If this routine returns a non-success
    status code, then setupdd.sys will not switch into non-US character mode.
    The implementation of this routine is free to call SpBugCheck or otherwise
    inform the user of any errors if it wishes to halt setup if font
    initialization fails.

NTSTATUS
SplangTerminateFontSupport(
    VOID
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine may be called in certain conditions to cause font support
    for a particular language to be terminated. The implementation should
    clean up any resources allocated during SplangInitializeFontSupport().

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    NT Status code indicating outcome.

PVIDEO_FUNCTION_VECTOR
SplangGetVideoFunctionVector(
    IN SpVideoType VideoType,
    IN PSP_VIDEO_VARS VideoVariableBlock
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys upon successful return from
    SplangInitializeFontSupport, to request a pointer to a vector of
    language-specific display support routines for a given display
    type (vga or frame buffer).

Arguments:

    VideoType - a value from the SpVideoType enum indicating which display
        vector is requested. Currently one of SpVideoVga or SpVideoFrameBuffer.

    VideoVariableBlock - supplies a pointer to a block of video variables that
        are shared between the high-level code in setup\textmode\spvideo.c and
        the display-specific code.

Return Value:

    Pointer to the language-specific video functions vector to use for
    displaying text. NULL if the requested type is not supported. In this case
    the display will not be switched into non-US character mode.

ULONG
SplangGetColumnCount(
    IN PCWSTR String
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to determine how many columns
    on the screen a particular string will occupy. This may be different
    than the number of characters in the string due to full/half width
    characters in the character set, etc. Full width chars occupy two columns
    whereas half-width chars occupy one column. If the font in use is
    fixed-pitch or does not support DBCS, the number of columns is by
    definition equal to the number of characters in the string.

Arguments:

    String - points to unicode string whose width in columns is desired.

Return Value:

    Number of columns occupied by the string.

--*/


PWSTR
SplangPadString(
    IN int    Size,
    IN PCWSTR String
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to generate a padded string
    appropriate for SBCS or DBCS as appropriate.

Arguments:

    Size - specifies the length to which to pad the string.

    String - points to unicode string that needs to be padded.

Return Value:

    Pointer to padded string. Note that this is a static buffer and thus
    the caller must duplicate the string if it is needed across multiple
    calls to this routine.

--*/


VOID
SplangSelectKeyboard(
    IN BOOLEAN UnattendedMode,
    IN PVOID SifHandle,

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to allow language-specific processing
    for the keyboard selection. The implementation can confirm a keyboard
    type at this time.

Arguments:

    UnattendedMode - supplies a flag indicating whether we are running in
        unattended mode. If so, the implementation may wish to do nothing,
        since the user will not be entering any paths.

    SifHandle - supplies handle to open setup information file (txtsetup.sif).

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    None. If a failure occurs, it is up to the implementation to decide whether
    to continue or to SpBugCheck.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to allow language-specific processing
    for the keyboard. The implementation can reinitialize the keyboard layout
    at this time.

    This routine will be called before the user is asked to enter any paths
    or other text that includes typing anything other than keys such as
    ENTER, function keys, backspace, escape, etc.

Arguments:

    UnattendedMode - supplies a flag indicating whether we are running in
        unattended mode. If so, the implementation may wish to do nothing,
        since the user will not be entering any paths.

    SifHandle - supplies handle to open setup information file (txtsetup.sif).

    Directory - supplies the directory on the boot device from which the
        new layout dll is to be loaded.

    KeyboardVector - supplies the address of a pointer to the keyboard
        vector table. The implementation should overwrite this value with
        whatever is returned from SpLoadKbdLayoutDll().

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    None. If a failure occurs the implementation must leave the currently active
    keybaord in place.

--*/


WCHAR
SplangGetLineDrawChar(
    IN LineCharIndex WhichChar
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to retreive the unicode value for
    a particular line drawing character. An implementation must make these
    characters available in the character set somehow.

Arguments:

    WhichChar - supplies the index of the character desired.

Return Value:

    Unicode value for the character in question. Because the character
    will be displayed using the language-specific module, the implementation
    can materialize this character by playing whatever tricks it needs to,
    such as overlaying a hardcoded glyph into the character set, etc.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to cause language-specific
    information to be written into the current control set in the registry.

Arguments:

    SifHandle - supplies a handle to the open setup information file
        (txtsetup.sif).

    ControlSetKeyHandle - supplies a handle to the current control set
        root in the registry (ie, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet).

    HwComponents - supplies the address of the master hardware components
        array.

Return Value:

    NT Status value indicating outcome. A non-success status is considered
    critical and causes Setup to abort.

--*/


BOOLEAN
SplangQueryMinimizeExtraSpacing(
    VOID
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by setupdd.sys to determine whether to
    eliminate uses of extra spacing on the screen to set off things
    like menus and lists from text. Languages whose text takes up
    a lot of room on the screen might opt to eliminate such spacing
    to allow menus to display more than a couple of items at a time, etc.

    The return value affects numerous screens, such as the partition menu,
    upgrade lists, etc.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    Boolean value indicating whether the implementation wants unnecessary
    spaces eliminated when text, menu, etc, are displayed.

    The phonebook also supports the concept of "custom" entries, i.e. entries
    that fit the MEDIA followed by DEVICE subsection rules but which do not
    include certain expected key fields.  A custom entry is not editable with
    the UI, but may be chosen for connection.  This gives us a story for new
    drivers added by 3rd parties or after release and not yet fully supported
    in the UI. (NOTE: Support for this may be dropped in RAS API)

This component appears to use a type of device driver called a file
system filter driver. File system filter drivers allow other companies to write programs that can access files on your hard disks. They are typically
used in products such as virus checkers or backup applications, but may also be 
used with storage devices like CD-ROMs, 'jukeboxes', or tape drives. 

This particular driver has not been tested with Microsoft Windows XP, and you should not continue to upgrade with this driver loaded. However, your computer does not have enough information to identify which add-on product is using this driver.

You can proceed by doing one of the following:

1. Identify and uninstall the program that is using this driver. Sometimes the driver name clearly identifies which product uses it. A current list of driver names and the programs that use them can be found in the Release Notes on your Windows XP CD, or at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/deploy/fileprint/fsfilteruse.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Devices. Find the entry for this driver, click <B>Startup</B>, and then click Disabled. Click OK, click Close, and then restart your computer. Restart Windows XP Setup. You can proceed with the upgrade, but the product thar::!t
was using this driver will not function properly now.

For a list of devices supported by Windows XP, please see the Microsoft Windows XP Hardware Compatibility List at  http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl. Your Windows XP CD includes a copy of this list (drive:\Support\hcl.txt) that was accurate as of the date Windows XP was released.

The scripting support allows you to install a large number of  Virtual  PCI hardware without having to go through the SoftPCI UI.  It is assumed that the user has a fundamental understanding of PCI hardware and particularly PCI Configuration Space. Details on configspace can be found in the PCI 2.2 Specification (chapter 6) or chapter 19 of the PCI System Architecture 4th Edition book. Feature Architecture The script engine support in SoftPCI provides the ability to control literally all aspects of a PCI devices configuration space region.  It also allows for dynamic creation of small or large PCI hierarchies.  This section describes the Script file syntax.  Script File The script file can be a file with any name and any extension desired.  Example script files may have *.INI extensions but this is not required.  The only requirement currently in place is that the file cannot be UNICODE and must be a standard ANSI text file.   Script File Sections and Parameters This spec refers to  sections  as those items which will appear in brackets   and  parameters  are items that follow the given section.   SOFTPCI Section This section indicates to SoftPCI this is a valid script file.  It must be the first section in the file and has only one parameter which is used to denote script file version.   Should a new script file format be defined, backward compatibility with older script files will be maintained.   Syntax: [SOFTPCI] Version=1 INSTALL Section This section is used to specify the additional  virtual device  sections that need to be parsed.  The parameters are user defined and can by any value desired.  Note: The sections that each parameter defines will be parsed in the order they are listed in this section.  This is important because you may want to create a virtual bridge with virtual devices behind it and for this to work the bridge must be listed first.   Syntax: [INSTALL] device1 device2 bridge1 bridge2 device3 device4 somecoolprivatescriptdevice User defined Virtual Device Sections These sections are derived from the  parameters  given to the INSTALL section.  They are user defined and can be any value.   Syntax: [device1] Virtual Device Parameters  The parameters for each user defined virtual device section can vary.  Only the TYPE parameter is required to install a generic  default  SoftPCI device.  The following describes each parameter in-depth. TYPE Parameter This REQUIRED parameter defines what type of device will be installed.  Valid values are Device, PPBridge, HPBridge, CBDevice, CBBridge, and Private. These are defined as follows: Device   This type defines a default Microsoft SoftPCI device.   PPBridge   This type defines a default Microsoft SoftPCI-PCI Bridge. HPBridge   This type defines a default Microsoft SoftPCI-HOTPLUG Bridge.  This is used to simulate the SHPC (Standard HotPlug Controller) hardware that has recently been spec d out by the PCI SIG. CBDevice   Microsoft SoftPCI CardBus Device. (Not Implemented Yet) CBBridge   Microsoft SoftPCI-CardBus Bridge. (Not Implemented Yet) Private   User defined configspace for all registers.  This type requires that the user supplies all required register settings and mask bits needed for the device. Everything is zero by default! Example: [device1] type=device [bridge1] type=ppbridge [foodevice] type=private SLOT Parameter This parameter is used to describe the  location  for the device being created.  It is essentially the Device and Function number for the new device.  The PCI Spec defines that the max device number per PCI bus is 32 (0 - 0x1f) and the max functions per device is 8 (0   7) (see PCI Spec or Mindshare PCI Architecture for details on PCI Device and Function numbers).    This parameter is OPTIONAL only if you are installing a device that will not have  children .  Therefore if TYPE = Device and SLOT is not specified, SoftPCI will default to BUS 0 (first root bus) and install the device at the next available device number, function 0.  If you install a bridge without specifying this parameter then you will not be able to install any devices behind the bridge. For format for this parameter is XXYY where XX is the device number and YY is the function number.  Example: [device1] type=device slot=0500 (  Here we are installing this device as DEVICE 5 FUNCTION 0 [device2] type=device slot=0501 (  Here we are installing this device as DEVICE 5 FUNCTION 1 NOTE: The PCI spec requires that FUNCTION 0 exist before you can install a sub-function.  Therefore if you fail to install a FUNCTION 0 device before a FUNCTION 1 - 7 device the install will fail. PARENTPATH Parameter This OPTIONAL parameter defines the  Parent SLOT destination bus  for this new device.  If this parameter is omitted then BUS 0 or first root bus is assumed. The format for this parameter is as follows: Parentpath = FFXX\DEVFUNC\DEVFUNC\....    The first value (FFXX) differs slightly from the SLOT format and is used to describe ROOT BUS to start from.  To describe a root bus, the DEVICE number field must be set to FF and the FUNCTION number field is used to describe the root bus number. Example: ParentPath=FF00\0200\0500  In this example we are placing a device specified by "SLOT" behind bridge located at 0500 (which is behind bridge 0200 on root 0).  If   parameter doesn t exist then we will default to next available device number, function 0. CONFIGSPACE Parameter This parameter is used to define the current configuration register settings for the device being created.  This parameter is optional if TYPE is anything other than  Private .  If this parameter is not specified then the default config registers are used for the device (see section 2.2.3.1.6 for details on default register values).  For TYPE=Private devices the user is required to specify the entire configuration register set needed for the type of device being created.  Examples of this are the Vendor and Device IDs, HeaderType and Class codes etc.  Checkout PCI 2.2 spec for full config space register layout. Each configuration space buffer for PCI devices is 256 byes in size.  Therefore configspace OFFSETS range from 0   0xff.  The syntax used by the Script Engine is: OFFSET: VALUE, VALUE, VALUE, ... Here is an example a SoftPCI device config space buffer: 00: DCBBABCD,04000087,06048000,00810008 10: 00000000,00000000,00818100,0000E0E0 20: FFE0FBF0,0000FFF0,00000000,00000000 30: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 40: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 50: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 60: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 70: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 80: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 90: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 A0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 B0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 C0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 D0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 E0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 F0: 00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000 Each OFFSET must be a HEX value from 0 to 0xff separated by a   and then the first HEX value at the specified offset.  Currently no alignment restrictions exist and you can specify any offset and any value as long as the value is no larger than 4 bytes (ULONG) and does not run past the end of configspace.   Examples: 19: 23 31: 12345678 Note that in the example above we will be modifying offset 0x19 with a one byte value of 0x23.  In the next example we are modifying offset 0x31 but we are writing a full 4 byte value starting at this address.  This means that 0x31   0x34 will be updated!  It is strongly recommended that offsets be aligned with value sizes being written to avoid unexpected problems! Another Example: 04: 07, ffff1234,,8765 Each comma   that separates a register value causes the specified OFFSET to be incremented to the next 4 byte (ULONG) boundary before writing the value following the comma. In the example above we start at offset 0x4 and we write the one byte value of 0x7.  We then increment the offset to 0x8 and write the 4 byte value 0xffff1234. The next two commas increment out offset to 0x10 (we skipped 0xc) and we write the 2 byte value 0x8765.  NOTE:  If the beginning offset is not aligned on a 4 byte boundary the offset is still incremented to the next 4 byte aligned offset.  Therefore if you start at offset 0x19 then a comma will cause the offset to increment to 0x1c. Currently there is no limit to the number of values you can place on a single line as long as you stay with in the 256 byte configspace limit. CONFIGSPACEMASK Parameter This parameter is used to define the current configuration register MASK settings for the device being created.  This parameter is optional if TYPE is anything other than  Private .  The syntax and format of this parameter is identical to the CONFIGSPACE parameter (see section 2.2.3.1.4 above).   The ConfigSpaceMask is used to define which bits in the devices configuration space can be changed (writable). A register value of zero in the config mask means that the register is  Read Only  and therefore the value currently set at the same offset in the ConfigSpace buffer cannot be changed. Examples: ConfigSpace= 00: DCBBABCD, 07 ConfigSpaceMask= 00: 00000000, 03 In the example above we define offset 0x00 to a value of 0xDCBBABCD and offset 0x4 to a value of 0x7.  The ConfigSpaceMask for this device has offset 0x00 set to a value of 0 and offset 0x4 set to a value of 0x3. This means that only the first 2 bits (bit 0 and bit 1) at offset 0x4 can get changed and offset 0x00 is  Read Only Default ConfigSpace and ConfigSpaceMask Below is a break down of what each device TYPE will use as default config space values.  You can override these values using the ConfigSpace and ConfigSpaceMask parameters.

Doing this allows for extensive testing of the PCI driver as well as general Windows PnP by giving us a means of creating virtual hardware configurations that may not be easily accessible otherwise. Timeframe This is an on-going development project but it is currently fully functional.  There are lots of improvements still to make moving forward.   Milestones Release Testing Strategy   Functionality Testing <Describe the testing approach for assuring the component is functional.> Robustness / Reliability Testing <Describe the testing approach for assuring the component is robust and reliable.  Also define robustness criteria> Compatibility Testing <Describe the testing approach for assuring the component is compatible with other components or hardware> Corner (Fringe) Case Testing <Describe the testing approach for covering Corner or Fringe cases.> Negative (Error Path) Testing <Describe the testing approach for covering Negative test cases, and error paths.> Regression Testing <Define which subset of tests will comprise the regression test suite> Test Architecture After the HAL/ACPI has detected and enumerated a root PCI bus (PNP0A03), SoftPCI gets loaded as a lower function filter to the PCI root FDO.  Thereafter the following occurs: During AddDevice: Query for a PCI_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface in order to determine that we are indeed loading as a Filter DO and not an FDO. This is necessary because SoftPCI is also the FDO driver for all SoftPCI devices created. PCI.SYS is the FDO for all SoftPCI-PCI Bridges.  If FDO AddDevice, create the FDO, attached to device stack and return. IF FilterDO AddDevice IoRegisterDeviceInterface() so user mode can talk to our driver. During StartDevice: If FDO, succeed IRP and return. If Filter DO : Wait for the IRP to come back up the stack from the PDO and then grab the bus number out of the CM_RESOURCE_LIST for the root bus we are filtering.  This will be used when dealing with multi-root bus systems in the future. Query the registry for any SoftPCI devices to load on this root bus, otherwise boot without any SoftPCI devices being present. This allows for persistent devices to exist across reboot should a machine need to be rebooted for some reason.  Registry format is currently as follows: [HKLM\CCS\Control\SoftPCI] \FFxx\yyzz\Config Where xx is the root bus, yy is the device number and zz is the function number of the given device.  Note:   is used for the first entry to denote a root PCI bus and not an actual PCI device.  Config is a REG_BINARY key containing the contents of the devices Current, Default, and Mask buffers. At this point SoftPCI is loaded and filtering the stack.  Now when PCI sends down a query for PCI_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD, SoftPCI waits for it to come back up the stack and then replaces the configuration space read/write functions provided by the HAL/ACPI with private functions existing in SoftPCI.  From this point forward any attempts by the PCI driver to read configuration space will go through SoftPCI s private routines and SoftPCI can now decided to return either   configuration space in response.  The PCI driver deals with the returned configuration data the same regardless of source and this is how SoftPCI devices come to exist. SoftPCI UI The following is an example of the current SoftPCI UI.  As you can see it provides a tree view of only PCI hardware (both real and virtual) that is present in the machine. As the user changes selection in the tree the TAB information on the right is updated to reflect information about the current selected device.  The  Resources  tab displays the current allocated resources for the selected device. The ConfigSpace tab will display the current values for the devices config space. Only  Virtual  or SoftPCI created devices will contain a  SoftPCI Mask .  The Mask is used to tell SoftPCI which bits in a given virtual devices config space are writeable.  It is treated like a very large bit mask where any bits that are set are considered writable and can therefore be changed from 1 to 0 or visa versa.   For more information and examples of how the Config Mask works see the SoftPCI Scripting Engine Specification. One method of creating a SoftPCI device or bridge is to Right-Click on a given bridge or   and select  Install Device Here   This will display the following Install Device dialog: From here you can choose which type of device you would like to install.  Currently only the first 3 options are supported/implemented.  Selecting a device from this list will install a  SoftPCI  default device with the following Vendor and Device Ids: DEVICE   -  Microsoft SoftPCI Device . VENID = 0xABCD, DEVID = 0xDCBA PCI BRIDGE  Microsoft SoftPCI-PCI Bridge    VENID = 0xABCD, DEVID = 0xDCBB HOTPLUG BRIDGE   "Microsoft SoftPCI-HotPlug PCI Bridge"  VENID = 0xABCD, DEVID = 0xDCBC Cardbus devices and bridges have not been implemented yet. Selecting  DEVICE  will give you the following options.  Here you can basically only manipulate whether or not he device has  Decode  bits enabled by default and the type/size of the Base Address Registers (BARs).   The BARs are used to describe what resource type and size the device decodes.  You cannot specify a default range or  boot config  using the current version of this UI.  This can be done using the Scripting Engine.  In the example below the 1st and 3rd BAR have been activated and they have been set to a desired length.   In this case we are saying that this SoftPCI device decodes both IO and Memory.  When this device is installed Windows will arbitrate 128 bytes of Memory and 32 bytes of IO and assign it to the device. It is not required to implement any BARs if you do not wish the device to be allocated any resources.   MEM = Memory Bar IO = IO Bar PF = Memory Bar that is Prefetchable 64 BIT = This is a 64 bit Memory BAR.  When this is selected the next BAR will be greyed out and disabled.  This is because by default each BAR is 32 bits in length and per PCI spec if you need to decode more than a 32 bit address then you have you use 2 BAR slots to describe the full 64 bit BAR. Selecting  PCI BRIDGE  from the device type list will result in the following dialog.  Here we are given some of the same options as a  DEVICE  but we are limited to only 2 BARs.  We also have a new option of installing a bridge that is considered to be  Subtractive  decode.  This type of decode attribute designates that the bridge decodes all resource ranges that it sees.  Therefore a bridge that is subtractive decode will not have resources  bridge windows  assigned to it.  By default bridges are considered  Positive  decode which means they are assigned a specific Memory and IO range or  Window  that they will decode an any address outside this range is ignored.  You cannot specify the size/value of a bridges decode window using the current UI. -INSERT HOTPLUG SCREEN SHOTS AND DESCRIPTIONS HERE- SoftPCI Scripting Support See separate script engine spec located at:  %SDXROOT%\base\testsrc\pnp\pcisim\softpci\SoftPCI Script Engine Specification.doc Software Requirements Windows 2000 or later for free (non-debug) builds of SoftPCI.  WinXP or later is required for debug builds to work. Installation Procedures Currently SoftPCI is installed by running SoftPCI.exe and then selecting  Install SoftPCI Support  from the  Options  menu.   Command Line Switches /S:<Script File> -  This will cause SoftPCI to parse the specified file for devices to automatically install. /I -  Installs SoftPCI kernel mode (driver) support  (CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED) Logging Mechanism Currently there is no logging  Test Components (Modules) Test Component #1   SOFTPCI.EXE This is the GUI application used to manipulate everything PCI related in the machine.  It provides a  Device Manager  style tree view of only PCI hardware in the machine.  You can install pre-defined SoftPCI Devices, Bridges, and Hot-Plug Bridges. Test Component #2   SOFTPCI.SYS This is the kernel mode counter part and is responsible for creating and maintaining the  Virtual PCI  world that is exposed to Windows. Test Component #3   HPSIM.SYS This is the SHPC (Standard HotPlug PCI Controller) simulator driver (developed by DWalker) and is responsible for simulating the upcoming hotplug controller functionality. Test Interfaces Interface #1  I have considered making the IOCTLS (or even better moving to WMI) public such that others would only have install the SoftPCI driver support and then they could write their own UI to do what ever they wanted.  If this would be useful I should have a problem doing it. Test and Development Cases Check-in Validation Anyone making changes to PCI.SYS or any other kernel mode component that may have an impact on how PCI behaves can use this tool to validate their changes in a heavily populated PCI environment before actually making a potentially bad check-in.   PCI PnP Stress Testing By taking literally dozens of PCI devices and bridges that get created and removed, and all with potentially varying resource requirements, we can pretty much stress test our PCI Driver (and PnP engine) more thoroughly than we ever could with real hardware.   OS Feature Development Example of this would be as follows - Multi-Level Bridge Rebalancing development of multi-level resource rebalancing / partial arbitration by creating every possible (and possibly even some that may not be physically possible) PCI configuration required to simulate a given resource scenario. PCI Hack Flag validation Create as many devices as possible that meet a given hack flag criteria to ensure the proper work around is in place.  This would probably be a good one to go along with the check-in validation to ensure changes don t break existing workarounds.

Microsoft Word Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8Microsoft Scrubber: Design and Maintenance TitleScrubber: Design and Maintenance Jason Cobb Normal.dot Jason Cobb Microsoft Word 10.0Scrubber Tool: Design and Maintenance All of the Windows NT-based operating systems, including Windows 2000 and Windows XP and .NET, have a limit on the size of the registry system hive.  If the system hive grows above this limit then the system will not boot.  InMB Windows 2000, there was 16 megabytes of memory available at boot time. In this 16 megabytes, the SYSTEM Hive, Page Frame Number (PFN) database, loader, kernel, HAL, and boot drivers must load. Windows .NET increases the size of the memory available at boot time for the system as follows: Windows .NET (32-bit) is limited to a quarter (1/4) of available memory up to 1GB.  Windows .NET (32-bit) with the /3GB switch is still limited to the 16 megabytes.  Windows .NET (64-bit) has been increased to 32 megabytes.  Additionally, Windows .NET has a safe-guard built in that won t allow the system hive to grow larger then system memory; it accomplishes this by failing all future registry writes.  By far the largest consumer of the system hive is Plug and Play (PnP).  PnP stores information about each piece of hardware, along with their corresponding driver and device interface information, in the system hive.  This includes the device s hardware and compatible IDs, description, manufacturer, provider, the INF that was used to install the driver, the setup class of the driver, and other information.  PnP stores this information in the system hive not only for live devices (devices that are currently present on the machine), but also for phantom devices (devices that were once in the machine but are not currently).  PnP has to remember information about phantom devices or else it would need to search for drivers every time the device was enumerated again.  On certain large server machine configurations, these phantom devnodes can consume so much space that they will push the system hive over its size limit.  This happens when companies add and remove huge cabinets of disks for backup and maintenance.   The purpose of the scrubber tool is to clean out the phantom devnode information for devices of class GUID_DEVCLASS_DISKDRIVE and GUID_DEVCLASS_VOLUME.  The code can be easily modified to handle additional classes simply by adding additional classes to the ClassesToClean array.  To clean out the registry information for these phantom devnodes, the code simply enumerates all the devices of the classes specified in the ClassesToClean array by calling SetupDiGetClassDevs.  If the DIGCF_PRESENT flag is not passed to SetupDiGetClassDevs then it will include phantoms in the list.  Scrubber then enumerates the devices in this list and checks if they are a live device or a phantom.  To determine if a device is a phantom, Scrubber simply calls CM_Get_DevNode_Status on the devnode and if the return code is either CR_NO_SUCH_DEVINST or CR_NO_SUCH_VALUE then the devnode is considered a phantom.  For all phantom devnodes Scrubber calls SetupDiCallClassInstaller with DIF_REMOVE to clean up all traces of this devnode from the system hive.   The above description works fine on Windows XP and beyond, however it doesn t clean up all the registry information on Windows 2000.  Due to a bug in Windows 2000 only the device s hardware and software keys get cleaned up, but the device s device interface values do not get cleaned up.  Since the device interface values can get quite large, Scrubber needed special code to manually clean these up in Windows 2000.  To clean up the device interface values in Windows 2000 Scrubber enumerates through the array DeviceInterfacesToClean.  This array contains the following device interfaces: DiskClassGuid, PartitionClassGuid, WriteOnceDiskClassGuid, VolumeClassGuid, and StoragePortClassGuid.  Other device interface values can easily be added by adding the new device interface GUID to the DeviceInterfacesToClean array.  For each of these device interface GUIDs, Scrubber calls SetupDiGetClassDevs with the DIGCF_DEVICEINTERFACE flag and passes in the device interface GUID and the phantom devnode.  It then calls SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces to enumerate through the device interfaces and SetupDiRemoveDeviceInterface to remove them from the system hive. The reason that Scrubber only cleans up disk and volume devnodes is because that is the only real customer case we have seen of phantom devnodes taking up so much space that the system hive is at its limit.  Deleting all phantom devnodes on the machine can be very dangerous and can cause unknown problems and maybe even a bug check.  Because of this, any new device class that is added to Scrubber must be thoroughly tested to ensure that no adverse behavior occurs.  There are known devnodes like the ROOT devnode that always show up as a phantom.  If this devnode is deleted from the system hive then the machine will not boot. Once the phantom devnodes are removed from the system hive the registry system hive needs to be compressed.  This is very important, since the registry does not compress its empty space when a key or value is removed.  Therefore if the registry is not told to compress then there will be no space savings.  Compressing the registry varies from Windows version to Windows version.  To compress the registry in Windows 2000, RegSaveKey must be called on the system hive.  This will save the entire system hive to a file on the disk.  When the registry is saved as a file, all empty space in the registry will be removed, thus shrinking the hive.  To get the shrunk hive to load again the RegReplaceKey API must be called.  The registry is not replaced until the machine is rebooted. It is important to reboot the system immediately following the call to RegReplaceKey since any subsequent updates to the system hive will be lost once the system is rebooted and any later call to RegReplaceKey is ignored. On Windows .NET, a new system call has been added, RegCompressKey, which allows inplace registry compression with none of the side effects or RegReplaceKey; it is safe to call at any time. The operating system also will attempt to compress the registry on shutdown if it determines that there is greater than 10% free space in the uncompressed system hive. Building the Scrubber Tool The scrubber tool lives in the Windows XP source tree under nt\base\pnp\tools\scrubber.  It should be built using the Windows XP version of the DDK and SDK.

USING SC.EXE TO DEVELOP WINDOWS NT SERVICES  
January 1995

(From MSDN Library, July 1996)

A little-known command-line utility, SC.EXE, can help you develop your services for Microsoft Windows NT. SC.EXE, which is provided in the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) MSTOOLS directory, implements calls to all of the Windows NT service control application programming interface (API) functions. You can set the parameters to these functions by specifying them on the command line. SC.EXE also displays service status and retrieves the values stored in the status structure fields. The utility also lets you specify the name of a remote computer so that you can call the service API functions or view the service status structures on the remote computer.

This article describes how to use the SC.EXE utility to obtain detailed information about Windows NT services. For more information about developing Windows NT services and for detailed reference information about the Windows NT Service API functions, such as ControlService and QueryServiceStatus, see the Win32 SDK documentation (Development Library, Product Documentation, SDKs).

SC.EXE is a development tool that provides more detailed and accurate information about services than the two end-user utilities that are provided with the operating system. The Services Control Panel application and the network command-line interface, NET.EXE, can tell you that a service is running, stopped, or paused. These tools are fine for completely debugged and running services when everything is going smoothly. But when things go wrong, as sometimes happens when developing new code, the information provided by these tools can be misleading.

For instance, if during the development stage your service hangs in the start-pending state, the Control Panel and NET.EXE report its state as running. If the service hangs when in the stop-pending state, NET START reports the status as running, and the Control Panel reports it as stopped. If you then attempt to start it, the Control Panel tells you the service is already running. This can be quite confusing.

SC.EXE lets you query the service status and retrieve the values stored in the status structure fields. The NET.EXE program and the Services Control Panel application don't provide the complete status for the service. The SC program, however, will tell you the exact state of the service as well as show you the last checkpoint number and wait hint. The checkpoint can then be used as a debugging tool because it provides a clear indication of how far along the initialization had progressed before the program froze.

SC.EXE also allows you to call any of the service control API functions and vary any of the parameters from the command line. This offers several advantages to the service developer. For instance, it provides a convenient way of creating or configuring the service information in the Registry and the Service Control Manager's database. The developer doesn't have to configure the service by manually creating entries in the Registry and then rebooting the machine in order to force the Service Control Manager to update its database.

As a command line program, SC.EXE can also be used to create tests for your service. You can create batch (command) files that call SC.EXE with various parameters that control the service. This is useful if you want to see how your service behaves when it is repeatedly started and stopped. If you have more than one service in your service process, you can leave one service running so that the process doesn't go away, and then repeatedly start and stop the other service while looking for evidence of memory leaks due to an incomplete cleanup.
The following sections contain reference information for the commands SC, SC QC, and SC QUERY.

SC

The SC command-line utility uses the following syntax:

Syntax1
sc [Servername] Command Servicename [Optionname= Optionvalue...]

Syntax2
sc [Command]

Use Syntax1 to run SC.EXE. Use Syntax2 to display help information (except for the "query" command--see the "Comments" section below for more information).

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Command
Specifies the SC command. Note that many of the SC commands require administrative privilege on the specified computer. SC supports the following commands:
  
Command	Description

config		Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).

continue	Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.

control		Sends a control to a service.

create		Creates a service (adds it to the registry).

delete		Deletes a service (from the registry).

EnumDepend	Enumerates service dependencies.

GetDisplayName	Gets the DisplayName for a service.

GetKeyName	Gets the ServiceKeyName for a service.

interrogate	Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.

pause		Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.

qc		Queries configuration for the service. For detailed information, see the reference section, "SC QC."

query		Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services. For detailed information, see the reference section, "SC QUERY."

start		Starts a service.

stop		Sends a STOP request to a service.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional command parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs.

For a list of the available Optionname values, request help for the command by entering "sc Command", where Command is a valid SC command name, as listed in the Command parameter description above.

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. The range of valid values is often restricted for each Optionname. For a list of available values, request help for each command. 

Comments

Many of the commands require administrator privileges, so it's a good idea to make sure that you are an administrator of the machine where the development is being done.

When you enter "SC" with no parameters, SC.EXE displays help information that lists the available commands. When you enter "SC" followed by a command name, you can get specific information about that command. For example, enter "SC CREATE" to get help specific to the CREATE command. 

The exception to this syntax is "SC QUERY", which dumps the status of all services and drivers currently running in the system. For help on the QUERY command, enter "SC", and respond to the prompt, "Would you like to see help for the QUERY command?" by entering "y" for yes.

When you use the START command, you can pass arguments to the service's main function. Note that the arguments are not passed to the service process's main function.

SC CREATE

The SC CREATE command creates an entry for the service in the Registry and in the Service Control Manager's database.

Syntax1
sc [Servername] create Servicename [Optionname=Optionvalue...]

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the Registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs. The SC QUERY command supports the following values:
  
Optionname	Optionvalue
Description

type=		own, share, interact, kernel, filesys	
Type of service being created. Optionvalues include types used by drivers. (default = share)

start=		boot, system, auto, demand, disabled
Start type for the service. Option values include types used by drivers. (default = demand)

error=		normal, severe, critical, ignore
Severity of error if the service fails to start during boot. (default = normal)

binPath=	(string)	
Path name to the service binary file. There is no default for this. This string must be supplied.

group=		(string)
Name of group which this service is a member of. The list of groups are stored in the Registry under ServiceGroupOrder. (default = nothing)

tag=		(string)
If this string is set to "yes", SC will obtain a TagId from the CreateService call. However, SC does not display the tag so it's pointless to use this. (default = nothing)

depend=		(space separated string)
Names of services or groups which must start before this service.

obj=		(string)
Name of account in which the service will run. For drivers, this is the NT driver object name. (default = LocalSystem)

DisplayName=	(string)	
A string that can be used by user-interface programs to identify the service.

password=	(string)
A password string. This is required if an account other than LocalSystem is used.

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. See the Optionname reference for a list of supported values. When a string is to be input, the use of empty quotes means that an empty string will be passed in.

Comments

The SC CREATE command performs the operations of the CreateService API function. 

Example 1

The following example creates a registry entry for the service named "NewService" on the computer called "\\myserver":
  
sc \\myserver create NewService binpath= c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe
  
By default this service will be created as a WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS with a SERVICE_DEMAND_START start-type. It will not have any dependencies, and will run in the LocalSystem security context.

Example 2

The following example creates the service on the local computer as an auto-start service that runs in its own process. It has dependencies on the TDI group and on the NetBIOS service. Notice that you must add quotes around the list of space-separated dependencies.
  
sc create NewService binpath= c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe type= own 
 start= auto depend= "+TDI Netbios"
  
Example 3

The service developer can run the service in the context of the kernel debugger by temporarily changing the binary path (image path) for the service. The following example shows how to call SC to change the service configuration:
  
sc config NewService binpath= "ntsd -d c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe"
  
This example causes the Service Control Manager to invoke NTSD.EXE with the following argument string:
  
"-d c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe".
  
NTSD will in turn break on the debugger when it loads NEWSERV.EXE so that breakpoints can be set in the service code.
SC QC

The SC QC "query configuration" command lists information about the service configuration from the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure.

Syntax1
sc [Servername] qc Servicename [Buffersize]

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the commands on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver". To run SC on the local computer, do not supply this parameter.

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service.

Buffersize
Optional. Specifies the size of the buffer in bytes. 

Comments

The SC QC command displays the contents of the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure:
  
Information displayed by the SC QC command	Corresponding field from the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIG structure

TYPE			dwServiceType
START_TYPE		dwStartType

LOAD_ORDER_GROUP	lpLoadOrderGroup
TAG			dwTagId
DISPLAY_NAME		lpDisplayName
DEPENDENCIES		lpDependencies
SERVICE_START_NAME	lpServiceStartName

Example 1

The following example queries the configuration of the service named "NewService" that was created in Example 1 for the Create command:
  
sc \\myserver qc NewService
  
The SC utility displays the following information:
  
SERVICE_NAME: NewService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : c:\nt\system32\NewServ.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : NewService
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
  
NewService has the ability to share a process with other services. It will not be auto-started. The binary file name is NEWSERV.EXE. This service doesn't depend on any other services, and will run in the Local System security context. Because this basically returns the results from a call to QueryServiceStatus, a more detailed explanation of these results can be obtained from the documentation on that API function.

SC QUERY

The SC QUERY command obtains information about the service.

Syntax
sc [Servername] query { Servicename | Optionname= Optionvalue... }

Parameters

Servername
Optional. Specifies the name of the server when you want to run the command on a remote computer. The name must start with two double backslash characters, such as "\\myserver".

Servicename
Specifies the name given to the service key in the Registry. Note that this is different from the display name, which is what you see with NET START and the Services Control Panel application. SC uses the service key name as the primary identifier for the service. Note that you can supply either the Servicename or the options, but not both. When the Servicename is supplied, the other options are ignored.

Optionname
The Optionname and Optionvalue parameters allow you to specify the names and values of optional parameters. Note that there is no space between the Optionname and the equal sign. You can supply zero, one, or more optional parameters name and value pairs. The SC QUERY command supports the following values:
  
Optionname	Optionvalue
Description

type=		driver, service, all	
Type of services to enumerate (default = service)

state=		active, inactive, all
State of services to enumerate  (default = active)

bufsize=	(numeric value)
The size in bytes of the enumeration buffer (default = 1024 bytes)

ri=		(numeric value)
The resume index number at which to begin the enumeration (default = 0)

Optionvalue
Specifies the value for the parameter named by Optionname. See the Optionname reference for a list of supported values.

Comments

The SC QUERY command displays the contents of the SERVICE_STATUS structure:
  
Information displayed by SC QUERY command	Corresponding field from the SERVICE_STATUS structure

TYPE			dwServiceType
STATE			dwCurrentState, dwControlsAccepted
WIN32_EXIT_CODE		dwWin32ExitCode
SERVICE_EXIT_CODE	dwServiceSpecificExitCode
CHECKPOINT		dwCheckPoint
WAIT_HINT		dwWaitHint

Using the SC QUERY command after booting the machine will tell you whether or not an attempt was made to start this service. If the service was started successfully, the WIN32_EXIT_CODE field should contain a zero (0). If the service failed to start when an attempt was made, this field should contain an exit code provided by the service when it realized it couldn't start.

Examples

To query the status of the service, "NewService," enter:
  
sc query NewService
  
SC displays the following information:
  
    SERVICE_NAME: NewService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        STATE              : 1  STOPPED
                           (NOT_STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 1077       (0x435)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
  
Notice that there is an exit code for this service, even though it has not yet been run. Entering the Windows NT command "net helpmsg 1077" at the command line returns the following text information for error 1077:
  
No attempts to start the service have been made since the last boot.
  
Net Helpmsg can be used to display the text for most Windows NT error messages. This particular exit code indicates that this service hasn't yet been run. Although obvious in this case, this particular exit code is a useful one to look for if you are expecting your service to be auto-started or perhaps when another auto-start service has a dependency on your service. 

To enumerate status for active services and drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query 
  
To display status for the messenger service, use the following command:
  
sc query messenger 
  
To enumerate only active drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query type= driver
  
To enumerate only Win32 services, use the following command:
  
sc query type= service
  
To enumerate all services and drivers, use the following command:
  
sc query state= all
  
To enumerate with a 50 byte buffer, use the following command:
  
sc query bufsize= 50
  
To enumerate with resume index = 14, use the following command:
  
sc query ri= 14 
  
To enumerate all interactive services, use the following command:
  
sc query type= service type= interact

Unify codepaths in ScTerminateServiceProcess -- two blocks of duplicated code.

Slight shutdown perf improvements?
    1.  Make special stop message asynchronous

It is very easy to write (or convert) your service to take advantage of svchost.   The basic steps are:  Export a ServiceMain entrypoint from a DLL  Choose a Svchost Group to run under  Setup your service to use the correct ImagePath  Process-wide COM security issues  Here are other items of interest:  Things to keep in mind  Debugging tips  Export a ServiceMain entrypoint from your DLL Your DLL must export an entry point with a signature matching LPSERVICE_MAIN_FUNCTIONW (found in \nt\public\sdk\inc\winsvc.h)  typedef VOID (WINAPI *LPSERVICE_MAIN_FUNCTIONW)(     DWORD dwNumServicesArgs,     LPWSTR *lpServiceArgVectors     ); (Note the wide version and not the ANSI version.) The implementation of this function is specific to your service. Additionally, the service should have the following values located under its 'Parameters' key (i.e. located under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service>\Parameters): ServiceDll  : REG_EXPAND_SZ : <path to DLL>  REQUIRED ServiceMain : REG_SZ        : <FunctionName> OPTIONAL If the ServiceMain value is not present, then it defaults to "ServiceMain". Choose a Svchost Group to run under Svchost Groups provide a means of separating or combining services in the same instance of svchost.exe.  Svchost Groups can be chosen arbitrarily.  One instance of svchost.exe will run for each Svchost Group defined. Svchost Groups are defined based on the registry values found under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost.  Each value under this key represents a Svchost Group.  Each value is a REG_MULTI_SZ and contains the services that run under that Svchost Group.  The following is an example: netsvcs: REG_MULTI_SZ: Netman Rasauto Rasman RemoteAccess foosvcs: REG_MULTI_SZ: MyService SomeOtherService For the above example, the four services (Netman, Rasauto, Rasman, and RemoteAccess) would run under one instance of svchost.exe, while MyService and SomeOtherService would run under a different instance of svchost.exe. Choose your Svchost Group while keeping the following in mind:  Don't just add one because you think you need your own.  The only reason svchost.exe exists is to reduce our process count.  Try to pick the closest "matching" Svchost Group already defined.  For example, if your service is network related, you probabaly belong in the netsvcs Svchost Group.  Everyone belonging to a specific Svchost Group must agree on process-wide security settings.  These security settings can (but don't necessarily need to) be setup by a call to CoInitializeSecurity made by svchost on behalf of the services.  For more information see Process Security Issues.  Setup your service to use the correct ImagePath After choosing your Svchost Group (above) you are ready to specify the ImagePath your service needs in order to run in svchost.exe.  Each service that will be resident in an instance of the svchost.exe process must have an ImagePath of the following form:  %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k <svchost group> For example, if you picked the 'netsvcs' Svchost Group, the ImagePath for the service should look like: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs (ImagePath is a REG_EXPAND_SZ, hence the %SystemRoot% stuff.) Important: The service controller elects to run a service in the same process as other services ONLY if the expanded forms of their ImagePaths match IDENTICALLY. (Case sensitively as well.) Pay attention to capitalization, extraneous spaces, and other typos in your ImagePath. Important: The service Type (located under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service>\Type (REG_DWORD) MUST have the SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS bit set. (0x20) If it does not, the service will not be allowed to run inside an instance of the svchost.exe process. Process-wide COM Security Issues Svchost accommodates multiple services in the same process by lending a hand setting up the COM security settings for the process.  All of the services that share the process must agree on a common set of COM security settings.  Once decided, the settings are parameterized in the registry under the Svchost Group specific registry key.  This key is located at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost\<Svchost Group>.  Where <Svchost Group> is the name of the Svchost Group chosen above.  Svchost looks for a REG_DWORD parameter called CoInitalizeSecurityParam.   If the value is non-zero, Svchost will call CoInitializeSecurity at the time the Svchost instance is started (i.e., when the first service in the Svchost Group is started).  The following is an example. CoInitializeSecurityParam: REG_DWORD: 1 If there is a non-zero value for CoInitializeSecurityParam, Svchost will look for the following values under the same registry key. If present, they will override some of the default parameters Svchost passes to CoInitializeSecurity: Value name  CoInitializeSecurity parameter  Value type  Default value AuthenticationLevel  dwAuthnLevel  REG_DWORD  RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT (0x4) ImpersonationLevel  dwImpLevel  REG_DWORD  RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE (0x3) AuthenticationCapabilities  dwCapabilities  REG_DWORD  EOAC_NO_CUSTOM_MARSHAL | EOAC_DISABLE_AAA (0x3000) Unless you absolutely need to override the above defaults (e.g., for compatibility reasons), you should leave them as is. Things to keep in mind Please use the common   HYPERLINK "http://networking/archive/ncidev/docs/rtlthreadpool.htm"  thread pool functions  checked into the RTL library (or the Win32 equivalents) rather than rolling your own.  Be sure to have NO MEMORY LEAKS between starts/stops of your service. Since you're sharing the service with others, please be kind. ;-)  Don't assume that the process goes away when your service is stopped. Since it is shared with other services, you most likely will be stopped and started in the same process instance. There is a subtle ramification to this: Any global variables that you changed after your service started, will retain these settings after it is stopped and will be present for the next restart. You should therefore re-initialize your globals when shutting down if you depend on the initialized value when starting up. Starting/stopping your service repeatedly overnight while running its instance of svchost.exe under pageheap is an excellent way to make sure your service behaves well in this regard.  Important: If your service is marked to start automatically (Type=2) you will need to place a dependency on the RpcSs service, if your Svchost Group is configured to invoke CoInitializeSecurity.  This is because the CoInitializeSecurity API needs RpcSs to be running in order to successfully complete.  Debugging Tips Having lots of services in the same process can sometimes be a pain to debug. svchost.exe provides a way to isolate your service from the rest by simply specifying your own Svchost Group.  Be sure to use 'sc config binpath=' to change the ImagePath as opposed to editing the registry directly.  To run your service under the debugger, you have three options.  Attach a debugger after your service has started.  Modify the ImagePath of your service to include the debugger executable.  Set a registry key so that a DebugBreak will be issued by svchost just before your service is started.  (You must be using a checked version of svchost.exe for this to work.)  Method 1 is obvious.  Method 2 is more difficult because you have to change the ImagePaths of every service that shares the same instance of svchost with your service. To do Method 3, you should copy a checked version of svchost.exe to your machine and add the following registry key and value: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost\<service>     DebugBreak = REG_DWORD 1 where <service> is the name of the service as it appears under the Services registry key. If you stop and restart your service, a DebugBreak will be issued causing the JIT debugger to be launched.

Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6C:\WIN16APS\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\NORMAL.DOT     Differences between Win32 and Win16 Registry APIs Jaime Sasson Jaime Sasson Microsoft Word 6.0    Differences between Win32 and Win16 Registry APIs Auther:  Jaime Sasson Date:    04/29/94 Version: 1.0 This document describes the differences between the 16-bit registry APIs and the equivalent 32-bit APIs implemented on Windows NT. The features of the 16-bit APIs that are not present on the corresponding 32-bit API, were added to the WOW layer of Windows NT to correct problems caused on some 16-bit apps. Except for the behavior of RegDeleteKey, none of these features are documented on the Win16 Programmer's Reference. Here are the differences: 1. On Win16 a handle of value 0 is equivalent to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.     On NT, such a handle is invalid.    This behavior of the Win16 APIs is not documented.    This difference affects all Registry APIs.    This feature was added due to problems on Lotus Amipro. 2. On Win16, APIs that take a subkey name, interpret:         hKey = 0, and lpszSubKey = ".classes\\foo\\bar"    equivalent to:         hKey = HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and lpszSubKey = "foo\\bar"    This behavior of the Win16 APIs is not documented.    This difference affects the following APIs:         RegCreateKey         RegDeleteKey         RegOpenKey         RegQueryValue         RegSetValue    This feature was added due to problems on Lotus Amipro. 3. On Win16, RegDeleteKey deletes a key and all its subkeys.    On NT, it does not delete subkeys recursively.    This behavior of the Win16 API is documented.    The behavior of the Win32 is also documented.    This feature was added due to problems on MS Publisher.    It was decided on the early design phase of the registry APIs that this would be the behavior of RegDeleteKey.  This decision was based on security issues, and some other characteristics of  NT that would make this API incompatible with the 16-bit API anyway (e.g. multiple processes deleting the same key at the same time).    This is the only documented behavior of the 16-bit registry API that is not implemented on NT. 4. On Win16 RegQueryValue:     4.1 - Succeeds when the buffer for the data is not big enough for the data. In this case the API will copy to the buffer whatever fits in the buffer. There is no way for the caller to find out whether or not the data returned is the complete data, if the size of the data returned is exactly the size of the buffer supplied by the caller.           On NT, the API will return an error code indicating that the buffer is not big enough for the data. The API will also return the required buffer size, so that the caller can allocate a bigger buffer and retry the call. In case of failure due to buffer not big enough, the caller cannot assume that the buffer contains partial data.           The documentation of the 16 bit API is not clear about this behavior. It just says that the API will return in one of its parameters, the number of characters that were copied to the buffer, but it doesn't say if the API should fail if the buffer is not big enough.          The behavior of the NT API is documented in details.           This feature was added due to problems MS Works.    4.2 - Succeeds and returns an empty string if the API is called on a key that has no value.         - On NT, the API returns an error code indicating that the value doesn't exist.           This behavior on Win16 is not documented.           This feature was added due to problems on Harvard Project.

Overview
                                   
Device driver, service and application developers that wish to provide 
performance measuring capability in their software must have a way to 
incorporate the names of the performance counters and counter objects 
into the registry. Currently the only methods available are the manual 
installation of the names into the registry or for each developer to 
devise a scheme to do it programmatically. Since the "correct" way to 
do this is poorly documented and difficult to explain, the following 
utilities and library functions are provided to make the installation
and removal of these extensible counters much simpler and less prone 
to error and confusion.

The two command line utilities provided with Windows NT are shown below.

    > LodCtr MyDriver.INI

    > UnLodCtr MyDriver


LoadPerf.DLL is provided to the software developer to provide access 
to these same functions (in both Unicode & ANSI formats) from within 
a setup program.

    LoadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine
        BOOL    bQuietModeFlag)

    UnloadPerfCounterTextStrings (
        LPTSTR  szCommandLine,
        BOOL    bQuietMode)

The contents of the string arguments in the above functions are the
same as those for the command line.
 

The installation utility (LodCtr) accepts as an argument the name of 
the device or application's counter .INI file. The format of the .INI 
file is described in detail later in this document. This utility will 
enter the counter names and explain text stored in the .INI file into 
the corresponding data file and update the necessary keys and values 
for the extensible performance counter DLL.

The removal utility UnLodCtr accepts as an argument, the name of the 
regsistry key which is to have its names removed from the data files.
This key is the registry key that the application, service or device 
driver us using under the ...\Services key and has the Performance
subkey.
 
The extensible performance counter DLL must be written to look up 
the base values of the counter names and explain text during 
initialization for this to function properly.

.INI file format

The .ini file for the extensible performance counter will consist 
of keys and values in a format similar to that of a MS-Windows 
.INI file (e.g. WIN.INI) This will allow a format that is somewhat 
self-documenting as well as allow current Win32 utilities to process 
it and parse the data (e.g. GetPrivateProfileString). A single file 
was selected to minimize the development and maintenance overhead of 
adding or modifying counters and adding foreign language support. 
The contents of the .INI file are described below:


Usage Notes:

The following assumptions are made in the use of counter names and
explain text and should be followed in order to insure predictable and
reliable operation.

    - Index number ranges must not be overlapping between drivers

        The range of index numbers used by an extensible counter 
        must fall between the first and last values (see below).
        (gaps are allowed within the range used). If LodCtr is used
        then this won't be a problem.

    - Names must be assigned to EVEN numbers and Explain text assigned
        to ODD numbers.

        If the convention is followed as shown in the examples below,
        where each item is given an offset of an even number starting 
        from 0, then LodCtr will do the right thing and make this 
        assignment automatically. For this to work, however, the offest 
        values MUST ALWAYS BE EVEN NUMBERS.

    - Manual assignment of counter index values is not recommended.
        
        Failure to follow all the assumptions or manually modifying
        or "hard-coding" index values may result in counter name 
        text corruption or erroneous display of names.

    - Symbol file format must conform to the following:
        
        #define NAME    decimal_number

        The symbol file processor is pretty dumb and can read .H header
        files but will only understand lines that conform to the above
        format. (in line comments after the number are OK) see the
        example below for more information.


// Begin .INI file format

[info]
drivername=<name of device found under the CurrentControlSet\Services key>
symbolfile=<.h file containing symbolic offsets of counters>

[languages] // one key (value optional) for each language supported in file
009=
 .
 .
 .
 .


[text]  // counter & explain text for customer-defined counters
offset_langid_NAME=text
offset_langid_HELP=text

// offset must be a symbolic constant (from symbolfile)
// offset value must be an even number (see code example for why)
// NAME and HELP are literal text and identify counter names or 
// explain text
// langid must be listed as a key under [languages]
// text must be entered on a single line (though it can be a long one)

// end .INI file format


The .ini file must be loaded into the registry before the extensible
performance counter DLL is initialized (e.g. during or immediately 
after the driver is loaded for the first time. Once the counter names 
are loaded, however, they will remain until they are removed or NT is

Following is an example of how the various components of an extensible 
counter would incorporate the definitions of the .INI file and the use
of the LodCtr and UnLodCtr utilities.  This example has one object and
two counters.

// defines static structures used to build the perf data that is
// returned by the extensible counter routines

#include "devdef.h"

When LodCtr has loaded the contents of the .INI file the following 
registry keys will have been updated.  The ":" indicates a Value of
a Key; other symbols are keys in the registry.

Changes to PerfMon perfc???.ini and perfh???.ini files
------------------------------------------------------

These init files used to be under oakbin for NT1.0.  However, for NT1.0a,
these counter names and help texts are removed from the registry to save size
and improve system performance.  (save 200K bytes of pool paged per language).
The newPerfmon will look for these names in PerfC???.dat and PerfH???.dat inside 
the System32 directory.  If you have to modify any of the ini files, you have to run
a utility to convert them into a data file.  The utility, initodat.exe, is in
sdktools\cntrtext\initodat.  This tool will convert the ini file to dat file 
in the same directory.  You have to move it to the System32 directory after
the conversion.


InitoDat  filename

        Usage:-

        filename is the name of the initialization file that contains
        the counter name definitions or explain text for a specific
        language.  Initodat will create a data file using the same
        name with .dat extension in the current directory.


Please direct any question/comments to either RezaB or a-honwah.

A copy of InitoDat.exe for x86 is included here.  Also, I have converted
all the current ini fiels to dat files, too.
